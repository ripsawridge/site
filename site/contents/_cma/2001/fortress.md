June 15, 2001

A handful of pictures from a really long day trip.  Chris, Jake and I climbed
well over 8000 feet in a day, driven forward by the amazing scenery in this
forgotten area of the Cascades.

_A bunch of these pictures were lost over the years..._

This is Buck Mountain from the trail into Chiwawa Basin. There is a 5th class climb
up the glacier and into the rock band on the skyline. Let's go!

We are on our way to Fortress Mountain, partially hidden by cloud.

Fortress Mountain was pretty exciting!

Chris kicking his way up Chiwawa. I later went up the slope behind the rock on the skyline,
while Jake and Chris took a more direct gully.

The Bulldozer, happy that we didn't get screw-ad on our climb!

Here is Bonanza Peak and the Isella Glacier. North Star Mountain is on the left, and
the Lyman Glacier is directly below us, here on Chiwawa Mountain's summit.
