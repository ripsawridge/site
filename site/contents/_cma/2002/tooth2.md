* with Kris and Steve Allain
* June, 2002


Our good friend Steve was visiting from St. Louis. A staunch 
hiker and lover of mountains, he had been sorely deprived 
in the Missouri territories. He had a few days off from 
Aikido studies in the city, so Kris and I decided to take him 
climbing. At first we thought of something like an old 
favorite at Leavenworth, but due to a really fun experience 
on the Tooth earlier in the month, I was excited to take 
Kris and Steve there. The Tooth provides a mix of snow and 
rock climbing, in the heart of excellent alpine scenery. 
Less driving too! 


We were hiking by 8:30, and were able to park at the upper 
lot and walk on snow right away. Steve had rented plastic 
boots, Kris and I had light hiking boots. The weather was 
perfect, and the rustling stream was a merry companion 
as we trudged up the valley. Kris had to get used to walking 
on snow, something she neither likes nor...likes! But she 
came along like a solid trooper. Steve became our step-kicker 
as the terrain steepened.

We missed a turn in the trail, and ended up climbing steeply 
on a long traverse towards the upper basin (Great Scott Bowl). 
Kris wasn't feeling very well, so several times we stopped 
and debated returning. But she just needed some food, and a 
Powerbar did the trick. Meanwhile, the views became more 
expansive, and after another half-hour we were out of the trees 
and in the bowl. Rocky buttresses rise on either side, and a 
few boulders in the basin peek from the heavy mantle of 
winter snow. It was very quiet, and we saw little specks moving 
up the slope above Source Lake. The sun was out, slowing us 
down a bit. Kris wasn't used to the deceiving appearance of 
distant objects in snowy regions. The objective looks very 
close, but with each step, it seems to recede! We talked to 
relieve the boredom caused by this effect. Suddenly, I
heard the strains of "Pinball Wizard" and a golden-haired
rock star boot skied down the gully. "Michael?" 


And so the second chance meeting of Daniel Smith at the Tooth 
had occurred! The four of us chatted for a while in the sun, 
and went our own ways. Dan down to some afternoon errand, and 
Kris, Steve and I up the slope to the ridge crest. I noticed 
the slope below Pineapple Pass had melted out quite a bit, 
remembering a few weeks ago when our merry party had mistakenly climbed 
it to the top. Kris found the slope angle a bit intimidating, 
so I short-roped her to the ridge top, where we met Steve. 
He was a little awestruck by the surroundings and steepness 
of the final climb. He still couldn't believe we were going to 
climb the highest rocky spire we had walked under! 


Planning to rest at the base of the climb, we carefully 
traversed around a tower and along a snowbank. I belayed Kris 
and Steve up to the start of the climb at Pineapple Pass. 
We drank some water and changed into rock climbing shoes. 
About 15 climbers must have been on the rock above us - it was 
hard to find a place to stow our gear. Boots, packs and axes 
lay everywhere. Kris was especially happy to have reached the 
rock - she was in her element now! Steve, on the other 
hand, who had done so well on the snow, was still here only 
because he didn't know how to untie the knot we'd attached 
to him! 


Kris belayed me on the short first pitch. With our double ropes, 
I was then able to belay Steve, with Kris climbing about 15 feet 
behind. This proved to be a good system. Since it was Steve's 
first rock climb, Kris could offer advice at key points and 
help quite a bit. 


It was great fun introducing Steve to this kind of climbing! 
He would say the funniest things like "okay, I peed my pants 
twice on that pitch!" or "You people are crazy! Am I crazy?" 
or "Oh god, I can't feel my legs!" Although he was probably 
truly frightened at first, he learned quickly, and came up 
with a smile every time. I enjoyed sensing that feeling he 
must have had of absolute amazement at being in such a 
forbidding, magical place. We were breaking some fundamental 
rule of physics: colors seemed richer, the air pulsed. 


Steve's Aikido training came in handy as we climbed. He 
was too tense, and got a leg cramp. But by remembering to 
relax and breathe, it went away, allowing him to begin having 
fun with the climbing. He told me at the end of the third pitch 
about seeking out a harder variation to some mundane climbing. 
How quickly the mind adapts, then grows 
restless again! But the final pitch provided enough adventure 
as is. We followed "the catwalk" for 10 feet to the left. 
Here, Steve learned about "exposure," because he had to look 
down at his feet as he inched along the wall. There are no 
handholds As you move left, the abyss beneath grows deeper, 
revealing tiny trees far below. Then, 
we climbed up and back right, following an excellent 
crack in the rock that provided me with a chance to place some protection 
against a fall. The trickiest moves of the day were here - 
now you have great handholds but no footholds! As I belayed, 
I felt slack on Kris's line, but Steve had stopped moving. 
Kris climbed up closer and helped him make the final moves 
with a few suggestions. Steve's head appeared over the cliff 
edge, and he made the final bouldery move to join me just 
below the summit. "I pissed my pants twice, and defecated at
least once on that pitch," confessed Steve, equal parts mischief
and relief!


Cheerfully, Kris popped up and our happy trio scrambled the 
final feet to the summit. We had made good time on the rock 
climbing, and deserved to linger for a while, looking at 
Rainier to the south. A cloud spilled onto the Emmons 
Glacier from the summit, and a bank of gray clouds was coming 
towards us from the ocean. But all the peaks were still 
in the sun. I pointed out Mt. Stuart, Mt. Thompson and many 
others. Steve carefully probed the edges of the summit block. 
We had the place to ourselves. It was really fun. 


Finally, I went to prepare the rappel. I didn't have a rappel 
device, so I used a Muenter hitch. This kinked the rope horribly. 
Really, I've never seen anything like it, though I've rappelled 
on a Muenter hitch many times. Time was short, and I begrudged 
the half-hour spent fixing the ropes. Steve came down on 
his first rappel. Unfortunately, he had to deal with additional tangling. 
Kris arrived, then the rope got stuck after the free end went behind 
a rock. I freed that, then got a belayed downclimb of the first two 
pitches (no more Muenter hitch rappelling for me!). This rappel 
was steeper, and Steve found it pretty difficult due to all the 
air beneath his feet! Again the rope got stuck. A very late party 
was climbing up, and freed the rope for us - thanks folks! 


We decided to rappel down the steeper Pineapple Pass route. I downclimbed 
on belay, then Steve and Kris followed. This time, the ropes pulled 
cleanly, but I stupidly forgot to untie the knot, so I had to climb 20 feet
back up the gully. It was growing pretty late. 
We hadn't expected to be out so long, so we had no headlamps. Oops... 


Steve glissaded down the steep snow to the basin floor, and I gave 
Kris a belay for her glissade. She tried to hike down the snow unassisted, 
as I kept encouraging (she'd say needling), but many times it was 
just too difficult. She felt completely insecure on the snow. 
Meanwhile, I was getting nervous about the time, and begrudged every 
necessity to get out the rope and belay. I hurt her feelings 
by insisting that she could just "do it." Boy was I stupid. Finally, 
I learned that we could move a lot faster if she did have her belay, 
and mostly she'd have a belayed sitting glissade. 


Steve was an excellent companion during this phase of the descent (which 
was the hardest part of the day). He would walk beside Kris as she 
glissaded, and wait with her at a secure place for me to come down 
and belay again. 
Once we got this system going, it took little more time than walking would, 
because I could send Kris down 200 feet at a time, then come bounding down 
myself in a matter of seconds. We worked together on routefinding. 
We had earlier thought to follow the Snow Lake Trail back, since the 
approach we took had been harder than expected due to traversing. 
But as we reached the Source Lake basin, it seemed easier to follow the creek 
back, hopefully keeping on a trail to avoid steep traverses, and getting 
caught down by the creek, as can happen there. We found a trail, and 
pretty quickly reached the point we had lost it on the way in. 
As it grew darker, we spread out. Steve in front, keeping the tracks, 
me in the middle, keeping him in sight, and Kris, just in sight behind. 
Finally, it grew dark enough that we had to keep right together, and in 
this way we happily came to the parking lot. Steve was so exhausted he
practically leaned on the car to take a leak. That cracked Kris up!


There was much rejoicing, and we felt really happy to have done this climb 
together. In several ways, it was a foolhardy operation, but because of the 
great effort and challenge, the memory of this great June day will linger. 
As we drove away, eager for Cokes, the clouds rolled into the Mountains, 
encasing the Tooth in a dark gray shroud. 


My thanks to Steve, who was valiant, courageous, and kept us laughing!
My thanks to Kris, who patiently endured much husbandly error, but
showed her bravery at every step on the intimidating snows. I believe
she kept on for her friend Steve, who needed her help on the rock
climbing. You couldn't ask for a better friend than her.
