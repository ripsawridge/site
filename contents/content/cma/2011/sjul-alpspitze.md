### Alpspitze
<i>July, 2011</i>

Training hike up the Alpspitze, started from the lift parking lot. Reached the summit in 3 hours, 1900 meters elevation gain. That is 2077 feet per hour for 3 hours! Bragging to myself because I feel old! :D It was really fun, I did the Nordwand Klettersteig up and down. Sometimes I left the Klettersteig to scramble on decent rock with a more direct route. I took the lift down to save my knees from 1200 meters of descent.
