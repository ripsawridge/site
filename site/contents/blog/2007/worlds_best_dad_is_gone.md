My Dad, Thomas F. Soare died Tuesday September 25, 2007 after a long fight
with throat cancer. He was the greatest husband my Mom could have. He was
the best Dad I could have. He was my Mom's boyfriend for many years when
I was little. I loved going to dinner at his place, especially because
his son Randy, now my brother, would play with me for hours! Anyway, Tom
and my Mom finally married when I was leaving home. I got to have a very
special time with them both when I moved back home for a year in college.
We would discuss metaphysics, music and politics for hours after dinner.
Those talks shaped me enormously. Every time I have a glass of wine, or
hear Vivaldi, or see anything having to do with Theater, my Dad, Tom, is
with me.

Dad I love you so much. I will see you on the other side. Pour me a glass
of wine and put on the Brandenburg Concertos. Lets talk in a room surrounded
by your father's paintings.
