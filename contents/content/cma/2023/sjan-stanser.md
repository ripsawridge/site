### Stanser Joch
_January 7, 2023_

I'd never done the hike straight up from the town of Stans. It was fantastic!
I thought it would be 1500 meters up through *latschen* but it was pleasant,
if very steep, forest and occasional meadow. Only in the last 300 meters were
there periods of time spent in the *latschen*, and of course the final 150 meters
were wide open. I enjoyed a chat with a woman who lived in Schwaz, hiking up
here from home, preferring not to drive anywhere.
