### Rittner Horn
_Late April, 2007_

A morning hike up the Rittner Horn which is a long sloping mountain 2000 meters
above Bolzano, Italy. I got to cheat by driving up from our vacation hotel in
Oberbozen (Soprabolzano) so I only had to hike 800 meters. Really nice hike up
and down. Sadly, the air was too hazy to get the incredible overview scene of
the Eastern Alps I was hoping for :-(.
