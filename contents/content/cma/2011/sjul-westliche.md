### Westliche Karwendelspitze
<i>July 31, 2011</i>

Training hike up this peak, the last 100 meters of the trip overrun by hikers from the lift station! But the 1300 meters before were fantastic! Made it to the summit in 1.5 hours of crazy fun hiking. 30 minutes to reach the Mittenwalderhuette, then an hour of excellent scrambling and steep hiking up rock steps and the steep basin below the lift station.

I took a via ferrata down from the summit, which was a bit spicy due to slippery, muddy rock on a traverse. 1400 meters elevation gain, 1.5 hours.
