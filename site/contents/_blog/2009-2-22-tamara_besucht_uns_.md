_That means, Tamara came to visit!_
  
  
Tamara found a last minute ticket deal that allowed her to come for two
weeks of fun. She cooked us an amazing meal, she brought us mustard direct
from Paris, she went to Venice with me, and other sundry fun items!
  
  
I have a Flickr photo set with all the pictures [here](http://flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157614304143454/).
