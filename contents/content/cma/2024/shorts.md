### Hike above Klausen
_January 27, 2024_

Interesting visit to the abbey above the town on the hillside. I prayed
a bit in the church, then wandered back into the cold, cold valley floor
of the Tinnebach. Thence up and back around towards the sun by an old
mine, and out into the sun on the road down to Villanders, where I looked
in vain for a restaurant. Galumpfed thence down to Klausen and a
early dinner in a good pizzeria. About 1100 meters up and down.

### Königsanger
_January 26, 2024_

Nice hike up Königsanger from Verdings. I got a hitch down from the official
parking lot back to Verdings from a nice cross-country skiing fella who
lives in Feldthurns down the road. He grew up nearby, nice guy. I used
snowshoes for the upper half, though snow became wet, deep and heavy on
the way down. Day started out sunny, later with ominous clouds.

### Feldalphorn ski
_January 19, 2024_

Skied up and down the Feldalphorn. Snow not super awesome.
It was very cold. I used a little video camera to film, but threw the
footage away (boring).

### Ski with Josef and Kirill
_January 14, 2024_

Great day with Josef and Kirill on Gerstinger Joch. We didn't visit the
true summit, but came close. Pretty nice snow! On the way down, we lost
Kirill for a while, and had a fun time searching with avalanche beacon
on the slope.

### Kranzhorn
_January 5, 2024_

Nice hike up and down.
