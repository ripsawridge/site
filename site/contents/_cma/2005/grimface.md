<h2>Grade III, 5.7</h2>

As part of our stay at Cathedral Lakes Lodge, Kris graciously allowed me to
take a "3/4 day" for a climb. So I eagerly packed some basic climbing
equipment for the Matriach-Grimface Traverse, rated at Grade III, 5.7 in
difficulty. A report from Drew Brayshaw indicated it might be a bit easier,
which was good because I planned to solo it. I had to bring a rope for
several rappels on the traverse, but the only 50 meter rope I had was cut
in two (semi-retired rope). No matter, since I only needed it for rappels
I would tie the ends together in a knot suitable for rappelling. 


Wednesday at the lodge was marked by constant all-day rain. Happily though,
when I left our room at 4 am Thursday morning I had a clear, cold, starry sky
to share the trail with. I made the now-familiar trek up to Glacier Lake, and
then the rim of Cathedral Ridge, walking slowly to conserve my energy for
the long day ahead. Due to a sad lack of preperation the day before, I had
no food, only water for the day. I also sorely wished for a windbreaker on
the ridge, as the cold gusts of dawn wind cut through my fleece jacket like
a knife. My hydration bottle hose actually froze for an hour until weak sun
could melt the water!


In the dawn I hiked along the rim for several miles, eventually coming
to the Wall Creek valley, where I dropped off the trail and descended some
800 feet, traversing south as I went on scree, heather and rock slopes.
I found faint goat paths that made the way easier on the sloping terrain.
Large, blank granite cliffs of Grimface Mountain were above me now. Eventually
reaching the ridge dividing Wall and Ewart Creeks, I marked that it had
taken me 2 hours and 45 minutes to here. Stopping to put on my harness, I
was finishing the hiking terrain a bit after 7 am. At a ledge below a steep
wall I changed into rock climbing shoes, but kept my gloves on against the
extreme chill of morning. This first pitch was one of the most exposed
parts of the climb, as you have to step out onto the upper section of a
steep wall dropping away below for 1000 feet. I climbed 20 feet
of 5.4 solid blocky rock to begin the traverse with a bang.


Following a series of exposed notches (one of which had a fixed rope that
I made a 15 foot rappel on), I was below the summit block of Matriarch
Mountain. Like Goldilocks, it took me three tries to find the best way.
First I tried a wide crack on the right with a nasty fall potential into
a scary chasm. Finding flaky rock and steeper-than-it-looked climbing, I
quickly backed off and moved to a 5.8 hand crack to the left. I also backed
off of this because the rock was really rough and I wished for
tape gloves. Unwilling to bother doing this (I had some tape), and unwilling
to cut my hands, I then moved left again for a distinctive 5.3 chimney,
which happily had a nice landing in case of a fall (there was no waiting
black chasm like the other two starts). The chimney was fun, except for
getting my backpack and body wedged solidly near the end. I had to
frantically unclip the waist belt and sidle half-out of the pack to
move. Oh brother!


From the summit of Matriarch, it looks like there is a long way to go.
Indeed there is, but a good bit of it is a scenic "sidewalk in the sky,"
where 3 foot wide walkways provide a charming alpine sojourn. The
sun was gradually winning out over the cold, which I appreciated because
I was tired of shivering in shady areas. In fact, sometimes on the left
side of the crest I saw drips of ice in pockets on the granite slabs.
As time went on and these ice runnels melted, they left wet black lichen
on the shady side of the crest that required care to cross safely.


Now I made a rappel, then climbed over and down and sub-peak. Coming to
another chasm on the ridge, I rappelled again, then enjoyed climbing a
solid 4th class gully to a ledge on Macabre Tower. Above the ledge
loomed a holdless vertical wall. Having brought 2
alpine aiders just for this, I could enjoy climbing the 3 bolt ladder
there. This was kind of a neat novelty of the
climb. After another chimney climb I was on the summit of Macabre.
It was still freezing when the wind blew, boy, how long can it stay
this cold on a clear August morning?


Another rappel led to an awkward stance near a wedged chockstone. The
rope was in a deep slot, and I worried about the knot catching up.
Happily it pulled ok, as it looked like it'd be a tough ascent to
retrieve the rope! Some friction climbing got me up to a granite
dome, then more "sidewalk in the sky" walking led to a rappel down
a steep chimney. Walking and downclimbing brought me to the base
of a steep crag, which I enjoyed climbing via a 5.4 gully that became
shallow and exposed at the top. Some of the thinnest "crest climbing"
took place next, providing an occasional hand traverse on the thin
ridge top. After passing 2-3 bolts at such places, I kind of think the
route is overprotected. If you do the climb with a partner and belays
(running or static), you probably just need a few quickdraws and slings
thanks to all this bolting.


Probably my favorite part of the climb was the Southeast Notch route
by which I ascended Grimface. Climbing a chimney, I wormed under a chockstone
then walked up a gully that led to questions. I tried walking around a corner
to exposed walls on the north, then came back to fashion a route up a
hidden chimney, doing some fun "chimney climbing" techniques. I shoved
my pack through a hole above me, then put my back on the wall behind and
inched up. Then I could climb down through chockstones to retrieve my pack
and put it on yet another ledge above. "This is a fun puzzle," I thought.
There was a short but good hand crack at a platform in the chimney system,
and soon I came to the "sandy amphitheater" mentioned in the Beckey Guide.
I climbed a fun wide crack to just below the summit block, then walked
past the occasional water ice patch on the granite (seriously, it was
cold!) to the summit. It had been a fun route to the summit, as the climbing
was varied and old-fashioned.


From here I could walk and occasionally scramble north on a well-marked
route to reach Cathedral Ridge. The way back took a while, because I kept
running into folks from the lodge and we would exchange stories. It was
a fun social scene up on the Ridge. With Sonya's party we took pictures of
the Giant's Cleft, and scrambled around on the side. They also gave me
an apple, a granola bar and some dried mango pieces - just wonderful!


The walk along the rim was even better than in the morning, as the day had
now warmed up. Reluctant to leave the high country, I made it back to the
lodge at 2:30 to find Kris with the babies and very happy I was back!
I started playing with Rowan then began nodding off. Soon, Kris had to
again take over while I lay in a stupor for an hour, only recovering
after a hearty ingestion of her delicious oatmeal cookies.


Overall, I thought the route short but entertaining. The approach from the
lodge does take 3 hours, but it is almost entirely on the crest of Cathedral
Ridge, and therefore very scenic in good weather. If you are going to the
lodge for any reason, pack some aiders, a harness and a light rope for
this fun little climb!
