### Wallberg

_January 27, 2019_

A snowshow hike up the old ski way on Wallberg. With somewhat elevated
avalanche danger I decided to go whole hog and take my transceiver,
shovel and pole. Very nice ascent...I had a distinct advantage over the
few skiers out on the very steep section in the lower third of the hike.
Never saw those cats again!

A few pics...

Looking to the fun-plex where I'll get some lunch.
