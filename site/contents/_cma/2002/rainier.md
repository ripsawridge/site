* Ingraham Glacier Direct
* February 12, 2002

*This is a letter I sent to friends Steve and Josh. Some trips feel too
big to write in detail about right away, I think this is one. Although we
didn't make the summit, it was a great learning experience. I want to thank my
partners for showing the way, and tolerating my mistakes.*


Hi guys,


I wanted to tell you that myself, 
Chris, 
Marek, and Kevin almost climbed
Rainier this week. We took two days off of work, and hiked to Camp Muir on
Tuesday. The weather and snow conditions were excellent. Very little wind, no
need for snowshoes on the way. We got there in a good time of 4:20. We dug out
the hut (15 minutes) and piled inside to begin cooking and melting snow. In the
night the wind picked up, gusting all around. I borrowed a big down jacket from
Chris, and this was essential for the climb (and sleeping).


We got up at 2:30 am, and were climbing at 5. (one stove for 4 people takes
too long to cook!). The wind was pretty bad, but we expected to get out of it
after Cathedral Gap. We were climbing the Ingraham Direct route. But at
Ingraham Flats the wind was stronger than ever. I'd look up the glacier in the
dawn light and see a vast cloud of spindrift hurtling down at a tremendous
speed. Then it would HIT us. Ski goggles were an essential to protect the face.
Entirely due to the strength and determination of Marek and Chris we continued
on, up steeper glacier slopes, stepping over the occasional crevasse, and
leaving wands. I remember the wind howling in my ears, the shortness of breath,
and the beautiful sunrise over Little Tahoma. The snow was mostly boot deep or
less, and excellent for arresting and maintaining purchase.

We reached the area above Gibralter Rock, and continued up undulating
slopes, many false summits gradually crushing my exhausted spirit! Chris led us
to a slightly protected crevasse to have a drink and something to eat. Marek
estimated we had 1/2 hour to reach the crater. Here Kevin offered to unrope and
wait, and the same desire awakened in me. My hands had been freezing, rewarming
only when I could ball them into a fist for several minutes. And the wind had
increased, sometimes knocking us back several paces. I was very tired! But we
continued. Above the crevasse, the wind and spindrift increased twofold in
intensity. Finally I was crawling, slamming the pick into the snow above me and
pulling up on it. Marek was pulling on the rope. We could see the rocks of the
crater rim, but to me, in this wind, it looked quite far, especially with the
crawling! I tried to communicate that I wanted to go down with Kevin and wait
by the crevasse, but Marek and Chris couldn't hear. So we all went back to that
place (only 100 feet down). We were all disappointed (maybe bitterly
disappointed is a better description!). But I knew that to remain a useful
member of the climbing party, I needed to save my strength for the descent.
Chris and Marek talked in Polish for a while, first deciding to go up together,
then to go ahead and come down with Kevin and I. Meanwhile, he and I had been
preparing a place out of the wind with his shovel to wait.


So we started down, Kevin, me, Marek, Chris. Now the wind was at our backs,
pushing us down the slope. It had also increased even more, and I could barely
see Kevin in a flurry of snow. Thank god for the wands, they were our lifeline.
Kevin was facing into the slope rather than plunge stepping, and somehow
getting less security with this method. He slipped several times on the way
down, pulling me off my stance and into a self-arrest position. After awhile, I
was used to it, and pleased that I got the chance to use that technique for
real on a climb! I was irritating Marek by pulling on his rope and he would
give it a mighty tug now and then. In the flurry of wind and noise I didn't
understand what he wanted. I thought he wanted me to retrieve the wands, so I
was doing this. But it was hard to avoid pulling, because I would feel slack,
take a step, feel slack, take a step, NOW THE ROPE IS TIGHT, MAREK PULLS ON THE
ROPE!!! I was an idiot, I should have carried a coil in my hand, but I
apparently wasn't thinking clearly enough. The other problem was the clumsiness
of my hands. I had mitts, which were vastly inferior to gloves. Holding a coil
would have been difficult. Getting water was impossible without removing the
mitts and exposing my fleeced hands to the spray. Consequently, at any trifling
stop, I was taking too long. I was forced to take a risk on the descent, by not
leashing my axe. It took too long for me to change the leash from one mitt to
the other as our orientation to the slope changed, so I maintained the slippery
hold on my axe with a death-grip, and was forced to keep this situation
uppermost in my mind. I wanted to rig up a sling from the axe to my harness
like Kevin (he also had the clumsy mitts), but the urgency and cold prevented
any chance. The hand on the axe would slowly freeze.


Kevin started going the wrong way and missing wands, I'd yell to get him
back on track. Finally I learned his goggles had iced up, and that made him
unable to see. He put me in front, and I waited for Marek and Chris, so we
basically reversed the rope orientation. We continued down, now used to the
conditions, but lost the wands for a few hundred feet, taking a wrong turn into
crevasses. Marek fell into two, and warned me about them. I went around the
hole, but fell in myself in a different place. Even this became a normal
situation. We got back on track, and reached Ingraham Flats, continuing in
strong wind all the way back to Muir.


A final example of how incapacitated I was by my mitts, was that I had a
quart of hot chocolate in my jacket. Trying to zip it up with the mitts, I
managed to break the zipper, and was unable to unzip the jacket to get to the
chocolate all the way up and down the route. Only out of the wind in the hut
did I discover how to get the jacket off and drink. I had to pull it off over
my head. So you see how new I am to this combination of high and cold!


We thought the adventure was over, but the wind had followed us down. The
Muir snowfield was a raging sea of roiling ice particles. Two scary things
happened. First, Kevin descended a few minutes ahead of us, and Marek
recognized he was walking well towards the Nisqually Glacier into "
no man's
land." I remember seeing his figure just visible above the roil and thinking
that he would disappear forever. I told Marek not to lose sight of me and I ran
after him, screaming his name. Finally, he heard something, turned around, was
unable to see or stand up to the stinging ice in his face, and kept walking
down. So I kept running and yelling. This time he heard me, and traversed left
as I indicated. Later, on slopes we had walked sleepily up the day before, I
fell in a strong gust of wind which then pushed me down the slope. I arrested
somewhat weakly, fully understanding how people could die on this innocent
snowfield.


But it was all a jumble. Mixed with these moments of hardship were scenes of
awful beauty. I'd got crampons back on because an area of nearly flat water ice
had us all falling comically. In a brief moment of clarity, the sound of the
wind left my consciousness and I watched a huge silent cloud heave over the
horizon. Tipped with pink, it was a harbinger of weather, with an army marching
behind it. "Jesus, what a godawful place," I thought, and meant it was an
amazing place. We got out of the wind when we entered the clouds, but the
whiteout sent us hunting for wands and tracks again. Then snowshoeing in the
dark, and out.


The gate was locked, but a Longmire hotel employee gave us the combination.
Amazingly, I wasn't very tired, and stayed up late watching the Olympics with
Kris. But yesterday I woke up with tremendous stiffness/pain - the muscles of
my shoulders and neck were like rocks. Also skin on my fingertips is peeling,
and a section of my cheek that was exposed to the wind turned dark brown and
peeled. Crazy...


Two days later, a solo climber made the summit quite easily, and at least
one other team tried on Sunday but the weather window had closed for good.


So that's some stuff that happened!
