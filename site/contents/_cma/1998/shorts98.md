### Summit Nordic Center, 12/23/1998

It was so much fun before, I had to go back!  I got in a
strenuous 5 hours here, and took the Silver Fir lift up
in bitterly cold wind (no wind temp. 3 degrees).  I made
snappy work of many of the upper blue trails, and visibility
was good for nice panoramic views.  But on the way down I
took a wrong turn and had a major crash on a downhill
run.  I bent one of their ski poles!  Finally, I reached
saner ground and the adrenaline jitters faded.


### Summit Nordic Center, 12/19/1998
Kris and I took a cross-country ski lesson on this 17 degree
day.  Occasional dry snow.  This was great fun, but we
used muscles we weren't aware of!


### Bunch of Lakes at Snoqualmie Pass, 12/13/1998
Phil and I used snowshoes and ascended to three lakes
around the Summit Nordic Center.  We had constant rain and
fog.  

### Mount Si, 10/16/1998

With all the rock climbing, I've been letting general
conditioning slide.  On this one day of sun, I snuck
out for a long lunch in my jeans and tennis shoes for
a flash ascent.  I made it to the top of the haystack then
back to the car within 3 hours.  Then I patted myself
on the back excessively and pitifully!  There were little snow patches on the 
haystack, and the mountains to the east were
quite snow-covered.

### REI Redmond, 10/9/1998

Well, I was the first customer to officially climb the
pinnacle here, I'm proud to say!  The climb was a
circa 5.8 crack on the back side, via top-rope.  Of
course, I had to ping off 4 feet from the anchors to
look foolish, but it was still fun...Thanks to Kris for
making me stick around to fill out the form and wait
for the staff to open the rock to the public!

### Exit 38, 9/27/1998
Kris, Bob, Matthias, Jamie and I woke early to climb
at the Club Paradiso and Amazonia walls.  I led the 5.8
climb "Lush," then Jamie coaxed (and pulled) me up a
5.10a route with an evil overhang.  These guys kept me
on 5.10a-d routes the rest of the day, my fingers withering
and muscles trembling.  I never really got up any of them,
but I sure did learn about suffering!

### Peshastin Pinnacles, 9/11/1998
Kris dropped my off to climb with some of her co-workers
for the morning.  This place was fun!  I led a 5.2 
(The Gully) and pitch one of a 5.7 (Potholes).  This
was my first chance to be on my own placing protection.
The Metolius 4-cam units are indispensable!  I tried
a 5.10a route, but fell on the hardest part.  Oh well!

### Mount Pilchuck, 8/27/1998
Kris and I went up to the basin late in the afternoon of
this very clear day to get sunset pictures.  Three Fingers
and Baker looked very saucy.  We stayed until dark, then
went down by headlamp.  A great time!


### Mount Si, 8/11/1998

Another conditioning work out, also to break in new boots.
Only a few people there.  At the top of the haystack a
couple followed me up.  The man gave the woman a compliment:
"You're only, like, the second chick whose ever come with
me on a real hike."  She said thanks.

### Cady Pass/Pass Creek, July 18,19,22 1998
Kris, my mom and I went up the awful Cady Creek trail to
drop mom off for her 4 day stay in the wilderness.  She was
visiting from Texas for this.  The bugs were rough, but
in late afternoon we found a great campsite along Pass
Creek, just over Cady Pass.  Mom did very well...there
were over 70 downed trees to clamber over!  We saw bear
sign, and mom was worried the first night...it was her
first time camping ever.  Kris and I headed back the same
way Sunday.  Wednesday morning I came to pick mom up by
a much better way: Pass Creek trail.  She enjoyed her trip
immensely, and plans to write an article about it.

### Little Si, 7/16/1998

While waiting for Mom to arrive at the airport, I scrambled
up the back side of this little mountain.  Starting from
a climbing area on it's flank, I found a faint path leading
steeply up through gullys, then onto faces.  At the top,
I decided to go back the way I came, the scrambling was so
much fun.


### Alpine Ridge, 7/5/1998
Kris and I went up in the late afternoon in hopes of catching
a sunset at the Forest Service lookout, and of seeing a
mountain goat.  Alas!  We did not come prepared for the
millions of mosquitoes whose torments we endured for 2 miles.
After they began biting Kris through her pants repeatedly,
we easily decided to turn around.  We both raced back to
the car, Kris admitting that trekking poles would be useful
going down!  (She has long held that they are a waste of
money...)

### Cady Ridge, 7/4/1998

Headed up Cady Creek at 8:30 am. The log crossing required 
good balance, especially because the log was wet and slippery. Pick up 
a long stick or use poles for balance. The trail was good, although 
there were at least a dozen major blow-downs and many smaller ones. 
That's ok, it just turned this flat hike into a cross-training 
workout! Reached Cady Pass and began to encounter increasing snow up 
to Lake Sally Ann. An ice ax would have been nice during parts of the 
traverse under Mt. Skykomish. I returned via Cady Ridge, making use 
of the map and compass until finding
 and keeping the trail after a snow-free traverse of the south 
side of a peak at the start of the ridge. Quite a bit of snow, but 
the trail was in great shape. A steep descent to the log crossing, 
and back to the car at 5:30. Whistling marmots at Mt. Skykomish. 

### Leavenworth, 6/??/1998
On my first time here, Kris came along with some rock climbing
friends.  We had a good time, until Joe's foot was cut by
a flake that he was pulling on.  This huge rock came crashing
off and flipped him upside down.  I lowered him and we got
him bandaged up.  Now, none of us trust flakes...

### Index, 6/??/1998
A great climber, Alex Krawarik, took me to an easy climb here
called Great Northern Slab (5.6).  It was 2.5 pitches of
pure fun!  I led the last half pitch, thrilled by anchor
placement.  We rapped down on a double rope. Phil Fortier
also came along.

### Exit 32, 6/??/1998

I joined some friends for rock climbing here, having a great
time on the flanks of Little Si.  I climbed two routes without
problems, then thrashed on a 5.10 crack route, finally resorting
to a pendulum in order to reach the upper portion (the crack
was soaking wet).  A teetery lie-back evaded me so I never 
made it, but I did learn how to fall better!

### Mount Pilchuck, 05/21/1998

This morning I enjoyed a pre-work hike up Mt. Pilchuck. I was on the 
trail at 5:30 am, in spitting rain and fog. The trail was ridiculously muddy 
then painfully rocky but I'm not complaining! Encountered snow after a sign 
"Blasting 1000 feet" at about 4200 ft. The ice ax came in very handy as I 
followed the most "likely" looking set of tracks after the snow-bowl 
traverse, which soon had me on a 45 degree snow wall. I ascended this 
about 800 feet. Then, when the top was 100 feet up, the way abruptly 
ended in a huge moat before a sheer, wet rock face. There was no hope of 
continuing, so I gingerly down-climbed my tracks, then plunge stepped when it 
was safe. Having never been to Mt. Pilchuck, relying on tracks in a 
perpetual white-out can lead to this kind of dead-end. I crossed two 
snow-slides on the traverse, and 6,003 glissade chutes. 

### Bedal Peak, 05/16/1998

Left the car at 8 am, following muddy path to river. Somewhere along the 
way, the path forked, and I took the right branch. The way led over three 
easy creek crossings and was well-marked by tape. Crossing the North Fork 
Sauk itself required wading thigh deep, not too bad in the morning. The 
taped path led me to a wide, shallow crossing. After this, the marked 
path disappeared, and it was brutal cross-country devil's club land for 
a half mile. I met up with the railroad grade traversing south, and then 
steep switchbacks trending west. I removed a few logs, and the trail was 
very brushy. I was making for Bedal Peak, so I left the trail where it 
crosses Cougar Creek. I got into some mossy wet cliffs as I headed west and 
a little north. After that, open timber and snow at about 3600 feet. 
By the time I got to 5800 feet it was 2:00, and I decided to head back. 
I was on a snowy ridge above timberline with beautiful views all around of 
Sloan, Bedal, Glacier Peak. All the bushwacking and cold, wet boots wore 
me out! Descent was quick and I naturally found a taped path near the 
river that had eluded me on the way up. It led to a crossing further south 
where a log sagged across the river. The current was much stronger now, so 
I inched across the log. This was a scary crossing, I was wishing someone 
else were there with me! On the west bank I lost the path then found it 
again, realizing it was the right fork in the path. Arrived at the car 
at 5:00 pm. A good days work! 

### Hurricane Ridge, 5/??/1998
Kris and I snowshoed and camped here.  She got some nice pictures, and
we had our first visit to the Olympics.  The backcountry fees were
incredibly high (I think it cost us 17.00 to stay one night!), and it
took 5 hours of driving to get there.  Kind of a downer, but I'm
sure we'll be back...

### Blanca Lake, 4/??/1998

Well, not really.  I made it to Virgin Lake in the worst fog I've ever
seen.  I completely lost the trail here, and didn't feel good about the
descent to Blanca where I was.  Pretty tough cliffs and steep snow
were abundant, although so were trees so I guess I could have swung from
branch to branch!  I want to go back though, now that the snow is 
melting away (writing this 7/2/1998).

### Paradise, Mt. Rainier, 4/17-19/1998
Spent 2 nights on a hill near Paradise in winter conditions.  Steve
joined me and we had our first crevasse rescue session, ranging all
over the area, and constantly trying to pull each other off the side
of a ridge!  Saturday night was cold and wet, but Sunday was
beautiful.  I got quite a sunburn, but this led to me perfecting
a method of sun protection that works very well for me.

### Monte Cristo Townsite, 4/??/1998
Kris and I walked up the snow-covered road in cloudy conditions.
Heartbreakingly, the bridge was out into the town proper, so we
turned around.  She got very nice pictures, and the sun came out
by early afternoon.  I think we should have started later for this
one...it took so long for the morning mist and clouds to burn away.

### Mount Si, 3/??/1998

Did my best to zoom up on a conditioning work out.  I did it
in 1 hour 45 minutes with the pack.  It was a mob scene, like a
"Climbing Rainier" convention.  That's all anybody talked about!

### Reflection Lakes, Mt. Rainer, 3/12-13/1998

We just moved to Redmond, and this was my first time to see Rainier.
Wow!  I had good weather on this solo overnight trip.  I camped at
the deserted lake, then snowshoed up to the Tatoosh saddle next to
The Pinnacle, a beautiful peak.  The sound of avalanches was thrilling,
and the incredible quiet in the snow made me feel very alone.

### Mount Defiance (Columbia Gorge), 1/20/1998
My first hike with Steve and my second time on Mt. Defiance.  Much more
fun this time, and the "winter wonderland" of ice we saw was fantastic.
Umbrellas were great against bone-chilling wind and snow.
