## June 21, Day -2

Here I am again. Driven back to a dusty range, away from the spires of the
European Alps, into a sullen forest of lurking bears and surly woodsmen.
Why? Why did I leave the good woman behind, promise to burn piles of cash on
scruffy but expensive motels, leave my pleasant and well-paid job for
clouds of mosquitoes and rashes in embarrassing places?

One stark and devastating reason, which offers me no inspiration yet won't
release me:

I need to finish what I started.

What I did bears no relation to the halcyon days of 2020 and 2021, when I dreamt
of walking the Pacific Crest Trail like my idols on YouTube. And little relation
to the actual fact of the Continental Divide that I traversed in 2022.
For the first half I was held aloft by those dreams well-dreamt in the years
before. In the second half my inspiration drained slowly as exhaustion and
giardia taught me that dreams are dreams for a reason: they do not stand the
harsh light of this world. They bleach and fade in the harsh sun.


I returned home after that, determined to record my impressions and remember
the good times. But to go back seemed ridiculous. Now I know what the trail
is, after all. A line of dusty footprints populated by obsessives no
more interesting than me, and I'm boring as f(#k. I
concluded that we weren't really living a grander life, but instead were
slotting ourselves into a narrower life because we suspected we were unfit
to cope with the ordinary. The ordinary is a kind of "noonday terror" for
many, including me. But it seeped into the trail anyway. What is that
exotic, long-limbed woman doing over there in the sunset?

Curating "likes" on her phone.

What occupies the mind of that idealistic young man, as his grapefruit-sized
calves power him to a stunning vista?

The hope of cadging some free ice cream in the next town.

In short, we are glamorous...until you get too close. Then we are ordinary,
or, perhaps worse, because to a greater degree than the actual ordinary
person, we believe we are beyond special: we find ourselves exquisitely
interesting.

The South Ridge, with some exciting scrambling ahead!

So! Naturally, if I HAD to return to the trail, I'd go as a misanthrope.
I'd ignore all the "hiker culture." And return I must. Because the gleam
in my eye through those years of dreaming came from the idea of completeness.
It wasn't "doing a long, long hike." It was the grandeur of crossing a country.
My country -- big and terrible, once riven by frontier wars, now riven by
a broken culture. I wanted to thank it for producing me, though it wouldn't
notice in the least.

So I needed to go back. I had to face my fear of the grizzly bear. I couldn't
just wimp out. This had to be finished. Even though the mountains were, well,
not up to snuff. I'm sorry to say it, but the Rockies are more about big
empty stretches of land full of game than they are about dramatic cliffs
and rock faces. Sure, those exist, and I saw plenty of 'em, but distances
are long. So on going back, I had to accept that my mission was somewhat
purgatorial: make the slogs. Establish the camps. Keep going, and finish the
job.

Now that I got all the negative stuff out of the way, I can tell you that
I was reasonably cheerful. After all -- I was still setting out on an
adventure. I'd be free of work for months. I budgeted 3 months and a week or
so for the trip. My first problem was getting permits for Glacier National
Park.

I put this off for a long time, then fumbled around on the park service web-site,
managing to score a camp for nights 1, 2 and 3. But I couldn't get any more
than that. I trusted that I'd be able to contact the rangers when I got there
and work out the rest of the trip through the park (I needed another 5-6 nights).

Barbara dropped me off at the airport. I flew to Calgary through Paris,
where a champion blacksmith from Waterloo, Belgium told me about the
horseshoe-making competition he was flying to there. I told him I used to
work in Waterloo and we shared memories of the local Ibis hotel -- what
a small world...

I had hired a shuttle to Waterton, and the driver picked me up at the airport.
Along the way I bought food at a Walmart. The Rockies were snowy and beautiful.
At the hotel I walked into the town and ordered a delicious pizza.

## June 22, Day -1

In the morning, I went to the park office where
a call was made on my behalf to the U.S. park office. A poor skinny ranger
sat on hold for almost 2 hours, then called me into the back to talk to
the ranger across the border. It was a very friendly talk, marked by the
rangers deep frustration with the software he has to use, to all of which
I murmured sympathetically. To his disbelief, I managed to snag a campsite
that everyone wants, and which was full only seconds before. I tried not
to scream that he should take it immediately. After a few mouse clicks,
he had my way through the park perfectly set up.

There was another computer SNAFU, but eventually it was overcome. Meanwhile,
I had to watch a video about bear safety under the eye of the skinny ranger
who secured the contact with the American side for me. Yes sir!

I was elated to leave with my schedule set for the next day. I'd have 3 easy days
getting to Many Glacier. Then two medium-sized days followed by a monster
24 mile day. Then one more day, and out to East Glacier.

Fantastic.

I was so excited, I had to do a hike. Trying not to think about how my plans
would be wrecked if I hurt myself, I decided to climb Mt. Crandell by
a narrow ridge that required climbing skill and good route-finding ability.
It was a bit much to bite off for an afternoon before the big day, but
I was just too excited not to take it on.

After an hour I was at the Bear's Hump, an overlook above the town,
looking for the easiest way up. I walked and scrambled up, enjoying myself.
At one point I had to do some climbing moves on a granite wall right
below the crest. Above that I met the narrowest part of the ridge
with pleasure. Then a longish walk to the summit.

Me on the summit, chillin'.

After a good look around I started down to the northeast, supposedly on
a "trail," but I quickly lost it in steep forest. I just headed straight
down, stepping over trees as needed. In fact, I'd rarely see a trail on
this descent. Mostly, the line on the map was just a marker of the easiest
way. Near the bottom it got ridiculously steep and loose. I really had to
be careful. Eventually I was climbing over boulders in the dry creekbed.

I popped out near a grand hotel (kind of a Harry Potter looking place).
I went back to town, ordered a pizza and enjoyed my last night in
the room.

I had my bear spray. I had my food, purchased on the way down from Calgary,
while my shuttle driver contemplated the horror of her colonialism.

## June 23, day 83 (counting from last year), 10 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day83.jpg %}
I'm off!

I allowed myself a big breakfast, then waddled off to the south (big
breakfasts have a way of doing that). There were many day hikers,
probably shunted here from the flooding of a few days before which
closed much of the park.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/13-IMG_20230623_122159_MP.jpg %}
The trail was crowded, and a nice person took a photo of me with Mt. Crandell
behind.

It was exciting to approach the US border. I registered for entry the
day before with an app, which meant I wouldn't be shot as an intruder
at the border. I got there to find a man with a glorious white beard and
a red shirt lounging on a pier next to the monument. I took some pictures
and we starting talking. He had a kind of "larger than life" mountain-man
persona as a longtime thru-hiker. He told me his trail name but I soon
forgot it. I just called him Cory.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/14-20230623_132415.jpg %}
My buddy Cory shortly before we met for the first time.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/15-DSC05095.jpg %}

blade of grass, doh!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/16-IMG_20230623_140515_MP.jpg %}
Relaxing on the pier...

We talked of many things as we walked the few miles further south to
the camps. Strangely, there was a sign at my campground saying it was
closed due to bear activity. Cory suggested that I go to the Goat
Haunt campground with him, another 15 minutes around the lake.

Over there we met a ranger who confirmed this was the right idea.
Two months later I'd learn the story of the bear activity when I met the
woman who was snuffled and sniffed by a grizzly bear in her tent!
But for now, it was a good chance for Cory and I to keep talking.

Our itineraries through the park were almost the same. He'd come in from
the west side of the park and befriended a woman and her young son, who
camped with us at the Goat Haunt. Together, we had a great evening,
building up a fire in the fireplace at the strange little "Peace Monument"
building next to the sleeping building, which was a kind of concrete
structure open to the air where you can set up your tent inside.

With the fire and the beautiful view over the lake it was a fantastic
start to the trip. Mosquitoes were out, but the fire kept them away.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/17-20230623_163041.jpg %}
We really hit it off immediately!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/18-20230623_171000.jpg %}

Goodnight with a dramatic sky...

## June 24, day 84, 10.5 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day84.jpg %}
Rain and soaking bush lead to high country and good weather.

I was up and off before Cory, though I figured I'd see him later.
It was interesting to disappear into the head-high brush around
the trail in the quiet morning. After an hour it began to rain lightly.
The brush thickened, but mosquitoes kept me moving.

I took a rest at a patrol cabin by a junction where sometimes CDT
hikers approach from the east, being unable to book a night at the
Goat Haunt. As I took off, Cory arrived. After a brief chat, I headed
uphill. Wow, the brush can hold a lot of water! Before long my lower
body was completely soaked, I mean wringing wet!

In high country under Cathedral Peak.

But as I climbed the rain stopped and the sun came out. I passed some
snow on the trail, wondering how bad it would get (not bad).

Before long I was at a beautiful high point resting amid some rocks.
Gorgeous views to the west, with a dramatic wall on the east.
After an hour or so, Cory arrived, complaining about the elevation gain.
In this early part of the trip, he really hated hills. His pack was
huge, and he said he was out of shape. All that would change by the
end of the Glacier section. But for a short time, I was more fit.

We headed down to camp and Cory showed me how to make a little sack of
rocks to throw over the bear hang, then hang the food. Cool!
Soon I'd be an old hand at that.

## June 25, day 85, 12.2 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day85.jpg %}
An unforgettable and not-too-long walk.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/31-DSC05149.jpg %}
On the trail to Spectacle Lake.

I was really excited about visiting Spectacle Lake with a short detour
from the trail. Cory was game to join me. It turned out to be
the most beautiful scene of the trip.

It begins!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/36-DSC05166.jpg %}
Michael at the lake...

We shared how thankful we were to get to do this, and that we seemed to
have the whole place to ourselves. We saw no one the day before, and on
this day we'd only see some campers in the distance once we reached camp.
We both laughed at the same things, and started the kind of joking we'd
do for the whole trip together, inventing silly scenarios that built on
things that happened or that we'd talked about.

Grown ups can play, too. But just like kids, the play isn't completely
useless. It's also about figuring out the world and your place in it.
We had a way of moving from the most absurd storylines into something more
serious. We're both divorced men with children, which means there are a
lot of years, a lot of thoughts, and some darkness shading the light in
our view of the world. Life is neither easy nor unimportant. Somehow,
you need a mix of skills and people. A mix of errors and success.
Cory and I both felt we'd learned more from our own errors than anything
else. Chiefly, it was good to be alive.

Michael crossing the creek.

Cory also was patient with me in another way. I'm on a spiritual journey,
well, we all are. But I'm trying to figure it out the way I figure out a
computer program. This means I'm constantly going on about some
"metaphysical" topic. On the one hand, I'm a fierce defender of Christianity
but probably, I color outside the lines far too much for a good Catholic.
I share with the occultist the idea that the world itself is telling us
something, and it is our duty to listen and learn. But then again, Jesus
did not say something different. He said, "knock and the door shall be
opened." We should look. But not only with our mind and eye. With the heart,
chiefly.

Cory put up with all that for MONTHS. And I regularly chided him about what
I thought of as his "Manicheism." Haha, you might have to look that one up!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/40-DSC05186.jpg %}
Looking across to the Ahern Drift.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/42-DSC05192.jpg %}
The Drift, and trail beyond.

We were approaching the most feared section of the trail: the Ahern Drift.
Its a steep snowfield that can't really be avoided, as it protects the
entry to a trail blasted into a cliffside that you need to use. We both
had axes and spikes just for this, and had been well-queried by the
rangers on this subject.

We got up to it, and with some reasonable boldness decided to just use
our ice axes and no spikes. By the time we were in the middle of it, I
wished I'd put on spikes, but oh well, concentration on the best way through
would have to do. I kicked steps with Cory right behind. He offered a
suggestion to use the thick part of my shoe around the heel to better
kick steps. What a great idea! I did this and was rewarded with better,
quicker steps.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/43-DSC05194.jpg %}
Other side of the Drift, the only place where an axe and/or spikes
are needed.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/44-DSC05202.jpg %}
Cory and Heavens.

We climbed into a little moat between snow and rock after the drift and
made celebratory noises. Yeah, it was a little tougher than expected. On
the other hand, spikes would have made it too easy!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/45-DSC05205.jpg %}
Another shot of Heavens, so impressive!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/46-DSC05207.jpg %}
The Granite Peak Chalet and our campground for the night.

After the Drift, nothing could bother us. We reached our campground, only
a little annoyed at having to climb down a few hundred feet that we'd have
to reverse in the morning. Once again, we had it to ourselves.

## June 26, day 86, 11 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day86.jpg %}
Crossing a spine, nabbing a summit and enjoying a restaurant meal!

Cory let me take off early because my plan was to climb up Swiftcurrent
Mountain before dropping down to the metropolis of Many Glacier. He
figured we'd meet up on the other side of the peak at some point.

I enjoyed the lonely journey up, taking quite a few pictures. On top
there is a fire lookout building and a resident marmot. I nearly lost
a ski pole to him! I set the poles down and messed with the camera.
When I came back only one was there. In fact, he'd dragged one of them
nearly off a sheer cliff!

Looking north from Swiftcurrent Mountain.

I said "hey!" and he let go of the strap and appeared to jump off the
mountain. I retrieved my pole gratefully, now decorated with some
friendly teeth marks on the rubber hand-grip. Losing a pole isn't just
an annoyance -- my tent depends on them!

The Garden Wall.

After many looks down to the the valley and Bullhead Lake, I started
down. Eventually I was moving pretty fast, kind of "hop-running," since
my pack felt nearly empty. The trail was absolutely incredible, having
been blasted out of cliff faces for long sections. Waterfalls seemed to
surround me.

Michael at Redrock Lake.

It started to rain in the flat forest before town. I got to the
restaurant to see Cory, and we tucked into burgers and beer.
He said someone knew me here and I had an idea who it was.
Sure enough, it was "Dragonsky" who I'd met on the stretch from
Lordsburg to Silver City the year before. We'd exchanged some
messages as we hunted for ways to get a permit for Glacier.
Happily she found some way, too.

Food...shower...wow! These were heartily enjoyed. We shared a camp
with some guys who we'd see on and off over the next few weeks.
Sleep came easily.

## June 27, day 87, 15.6 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day87.jpg %}
Over Piegan Pass through the heart of the park.

The ranger had asked me to try and find more hikers to combine onto my
permit in Many Glacier. The night before found no takers, and we didn't
want to wait around until 9 in the morning since today would be a
relatively high-mileage day over a pass, and rain tended to arrive in
the late afternoon. But a likeable fellow from Israel had curled up in a
corner of our campsite in the night. I walked over to the ranger station
with him in hopes of finding someone, but had no luck. Later he told us
that shortly after the station opened someone came by with an extra
space on their permit so it all worked out.

I'd resupplied food at the store the night before, and grabbed some
pastries in the morning. We'd also done laundry, so we set out fresh,
clean and well fed! After about 30 minutes we met the bear on the road.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/57-20230627_070018.jpg %}
The grizzly bear on the road near the Many Glacier Hotel.

He was in front of a pickup truck, slowly rolling forward. He looked
vaguely irritated. As he came towards us, we put our arms up and made
noises ("Hey, bear!"). He wasn't impressed, but continued on his line,
leaving the road for the trees. Cory saw that the bear was tagged,
thinking that might be a bad sign for the bear, anyway -- that he was
a "repeat offender" coming into town and getting used to people.

It was impressive to see how he paid us no mind. Over and over in the
woods, you see furtive animals. Their movements almost seem programmed
as they take every opportunity to avoid you. You get to know exactly
where they'll turn, look and dodge in the electrified space the
environment becomes with you, a threat, in it. There are exceptions
to this rule, with marmots for example. Their holes are nearby, and if
they need salt they can be relentless. Once a deer followed me on the
trail for 2 miles, hoping I'd drop a boot.

But this nonchalance was different. It indicated we were no threat, and the
bear knew it better than we did. I was glad we weren't having this meeting
way out on a trail somewhere!

We headed up Grinnell Creek. A couple of miles in we startled a moose and
her cub, who loped ahead of us along the trail then crashed into the trees.
Eventually the trees thinned out and we emerged in the sun under cliff
faces with waterfalls ahead.

Mount Gould.


We got over the pass and started down. Cory was happy to have made it
over a big pass, and sung various rock and roll songs. I joined in
occasionally or suggested different ones. We'd meet people on the
trail and he'd do a british accent and say irreverent things.
One lady had no time for it and just looked exasperated. I felt bad
for her, she must be tired out. In general, I envied Cory's outgoing nature
with people on the trail -- he left a lot of smiles in his wake.
I tended to just smile and say hello, but he often struck up conversations
and learned inspiring things about the people he talked to or news of
the trail up ahead.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/67-DSC05279.jpg %}
The verticality of this valley was amazing. Note the pair far below.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/68-IMG_20230627_153945_MP.jpg %}
Resting at Reynolds Creek.

We dropped down to the famous "Going to the Sun" road and rested on a
bench at an overlook where a volunteer ranger was giving a talk about the
glacier normally visible in the distance. It was hidden in lowering cloud, and
it began sprinkling on and off -- the afternoon rains had come.

As we continued the hike, we met a couple who told us two climbers died here
recently on rotten cliffs above when their belay anchor failed.

Safe from the mosquitoes in here!

We walked down to Reynolds Creek and put our feet in the water. The sun
came and went. In the forest there were too many bugs, so we retreated
to our tents after an early dinner. It had been a great day, and I was
tired and sore in a good way.

## June 28, day 88, 13 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day88.jpg %}
An easy day traveling along Saint Mary Lake.

We happily settled in to an easy day, almost a "rest day" because there
was no climbing or descending, just a gentle journey along the lake
shore. In previous years there had been many blow-downs on the trail
but they'd been cleared.

Cory captured a nice panorama here.

The views were tame compared to the previous days, and the country seemed
to get a bit drier. We had big world-spanning conversations about
philosophy, movies and our kids. Cory is a master HVAC repairman, and
told me many things about the construction business, about business
ownership in general, and the place where he works in particular.
He understood how small decisions on recouping costs or treating customers
respectfully add up. Businesses can go broke slowly, or they can build on
a good reputation to the point that they don't have to put up with lousy
customers, which also exist! For himself, he's looking for a position
somewhere out here in the west in the mountains. We often talked about
Stehekin, Washington, a remote village in the North Cascades. He could
certainly be the town heating engineer, and enjoy snowshoe trips all
winter. It would be better than Misery...that is, Missouri, where he lives
nowadays. Cory seemed to love snow, and once ran a snowplow business, much
to the exasperation of his wife at the time! I shared in his general
perplexity as to why. It all sounded like great fun to me too.

Cory heads into the broad valley to Red Eagle Lake.

Taking a break at the lake while storms threaten to the south.

We took a short cut down to a creek and forded it rather than walking
a mile north to a bridge. It felt quite adventurous...little did I
know that fording creeks would become a constant daily occurance for
weeks once we hit the Bob Marshall Wilderness. We hung out for an
hour at the north side of the lake, where a small rise catches the
wind and keeps the bugs away.

Whiling away a hot afternoon at the head of the lake.

Finally we went to our camp at the south side of the lake, which was
brutally hot and rather buggy. My tent became a sauna, so finally I left
to sit under a gnarled tree at the lake shore. Many dozens of butterflies
licked at the ground here in great groupings, wings slowly battening.
Why?

I kept an eye out for bears and people. Two men came down from a climb
of Mount James, which rises on one side of the Triple Divide Pass. Finally it cooled
off enough to go to bed. In the morning I'd have the huge 25 mile day.
Cory seemed inclined to do it with me, but would let me take off extra early
anyway.

## June 29, day 89, 25.2 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day89.jpg %}
The big day, a "double pass" day from Red Eagle to Two Medicine.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/78-DSC05296.jpg %}
Dawn at Red Eagle Lake Head Camp.

I wolfed down some oatmeal by the food bag in the predawn. Loaded up
and headed out. The trail meandered amid deadfall, little hillocks and
crashing rivers. I had to check the map often because it turned in
unexpected ways.

Looking up at Split Mountain.

Though finally the trail committed to enter the valley I desired to
climb, dominated by views of Split Mountain. I enjoyed this walk quite a
bit. As the climb to the pass began in earnest, I saw Cory below steaming
his way up. He likes to have people in front of him who he's obligated
to catch! I chuckled a bit at this, because it reminded me how I motivated
myself through the years. With mountain climbing, I was always afraid of
being the one most out of shape, and that inspired me to do lots of
cardio workouts during the week. Well, it worked. I was often the slowest,
but not by too much, and I could at least endure.

Looking back north from the pass.

Cory caught me at the pass and we moved rapidly down together. Half the
job done!

We reached a camp called Atlantic City (I guess this side of the pass flows
towards the Gulf of Mexico). It was a sad, mosquito infested mud-pit
scraped out of the forest. We got some water, much needed after the hot,
rapid descent and moved on as a volunteer ranger arrived.

I remember this section as hot and tiring. We made it entertaining by inventing
a couple of characters, Brother (Brutha!) Jessup and Brother Williams.
Two southern preacher-men who delivered long sermons with many references
to the various angel-food cakes and other delicacies made by the good women
of the church (pronounced "chui-che"). Practically delirious from the oxygenating effects of long
orations ("TEST-i-FAH!") combined with steep uphill travel, we arrived at Morning Star
Lake and promptly collapsed.

Two women came by then we heard noises down by the lake. We joked that they
must be skinny-dipping. We were right! (we found out later). Okay, so
we are essentially 12 year old 52 year olds in the woods. The 52 year old
won out though: it was **nap time**.

Resting at Morning Star Lake.

We got up from our nap, stiff as boards. Time for day two. Cory was allowed
to camp here, so he could have stayed. But he wouldn't let a friend walk
on ahead, so he was coming, too. We set off painfully slow. Lordy, this
was going to be tough!

Looking down on "Seven Winds of the Lake."

{% image /cmaimages/2023/88-DSC05335.jpg %}
Tiring now, we pass Oldman Lake.

Up and over the pass. We met "Wrecking Ball" in here, an exuberant
young lady keen to take an interesting side trail around Mount Morgan from
the pass (Pitamakan Pass). We made the long, long walk east from Oldman
Lake as exhaustion slowly took hold. By the time we reached the
valley floor and had to wearily regain some elevation to the south, I
was worn out.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/89-IMG_20230629_201608_MP.jpg %}
Cory walks tiredly to the Two Medicine Store in search of beer and a snack!

Finally the lake appeared in the form of big parking lots and pickup trucks.
We found the CDT hikers camping spot. Apparently a dozen of us would share
a single campsite. We left our things here (putting our food in the bear
box, of course) and walked over to the general store. Sitting on benches
in front, we drank beer and ate some kind of dinner (I don't remember
what). Wrecking Ball came up and told various entertaining stories.
Back at the campsite conversations continued around the picnic table.
There was no room to put up my tent so I just spread out my things
in a ditch and crashed.

## June 30, day 90, 11.5 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day90.jpg %}
A dawn walk up and over a peak, then hot and tiring country that made my
feet hurt!

I awoke bathed in my own drool at dawn and couldn't get back to sleep.
The beer had made the ditch tolerable. Now it was uncomfortable.
It was time to walk. Cory was up, so I whispered that I'd see him in town.
I was beginning to learn his ways. As I marched up a mountain, my arms
like cold slabs of meat waiting for the sun, I imagined that he'd use
the thought of me ahead of him to light a fire under his butt. I
wasn't wrong. Long before the summit, I saw my red-shirted friend wheezing
up the switchbacks below. Darn it, he was going to catch me too. Well,
I'd had enough of people for a while, even the good ones.

Oh, I saw the most amazing thing near the top of the mountain: two marmots
playing...scrabbling and wrestling with each other...slapping their paws
in tiny pinwheeling motions. Rolling, jumping...occasionally stopping
for a rest in an embrace. Starting up again. I forgot about Cory catching
me and stood there for 10 minutes. They didn't care about me at all.
Their play was far more important than me. This healed me a little bit.
To be disregarded by tiny animals who normally make a big show of
respect feels like a compliment or a shared secret. Smiling, I continued
into the sun, now warming my alabaster arms.

Two marmots playing on peak 7643.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/93-DSC05347.jpg %}
Again, marmots.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/94-DSC05352.jpg %}
The marmots and their home.

Eventually the hot afternoon arrived and caught me whimpering over my
sore feet. I had the first of several insincere conversations with Wrecking
Ball, like this:

"Man, you guys are fast." (*me*)

"Oh, not for long! I'm just eager to get to town." (*Wrecking Ball. Or anyone,
really. Any of these young people. Or, honestly, people 20 years older than
me too, like Swede*)

"Well save me a beer!" (*me, wanting to get back to my audiobook and
forget the insincere interaction*)

"Oh, you'll catch me!" (*an obvious lie. Was that a gleam in her eye? Hmpf.*)

This is one of the most popular games of the trail. The one being passed
adopts this attitude: "I'm old and slow. I'm humble and praise you
effusively as you pass. For that I expect you to self-deprecate."

The one passing plays along: "Oh, I'm only passing you because of some
temporary and foolish reason. Soon I'll be far behind where I belong!"

The one passing gets a dopamine hit at the freedom gained by passing the
wheezing wreck. The one being passed gets one too, though smaller and
marked by a certain bitterness: "they don't know how to enjoy the trail,
they just walk like machines," he might think. The bitterness comes from
the fact that he knows he's lying to himself.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/95-DSC05356.jpg %}
A last look north...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/96-DSC05361.jpg %}
We descended these slopes to low, hot country around East Glacier Village.

Did you think that the trail would free you of these social lubricants,
so ridiculous but somehow inevitable? Well, it actually highlights them
because they are the sole interactions between hours of silence.

Then again, I probably overthink this stuff to distract me from PAIN.
I was miserable in the last miles to town. Cory took pity
on me and said that he walks with two insoles in each shoe. He gave me
that extra set for my bruised feet and it did seem to help a little.
Satisfyingly, he began limping a little bit and complaining in the last mile.
"This must really work then," I thought, spirits lifting.
