### Frauenwasserlwand Klettern

_May 19, 2018_

Timo and I had the morning to climb, and it was nice to revisit this crag which I used
to know pretty well. We did a line of 6, 6+ at the roof, and 6- on an edge to the top
of the crag. Then we top-roped the 7- and 7 lines (for me, the former twice, the latter
once, and that was only partially successful!). We went down and both led a strange
line of maybe 5+ or 6- that we couldn't identify on any topo. I tried a variation start
but I couldn't even get off the ground with it. Then we climbed a 5(+?) line that definitely
felt harder. On my lead I had to stop a couple times at a crux, and there was a dagger-shaped
loose rock in the route pointing directly down to the belayer. This really unnerved me,
so I spent some time removing it from the route, tossing the pieces into the bushes
safely to the side. I top-roped a 6+ version on the right, which I want to go back and lead.
Timo and I then led a route of maybe 6- or 5+ on the far left.

In general, when the climbing here gets hard, it's intimidating the way hand holds disappear.
Good day...the rain came 30 minutes ahead of schedule at 13:30, but that was fine.
