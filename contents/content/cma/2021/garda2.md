Barbara and I drove down Thursday evening. We had two terrible traffic
jams, uff! But we enjoyed talking so it was okay.

Friday morning we went to Corno di Bo to climb some easy slabs.
I had forgotten that my gym rope was shortened to 42 meters, uff!
So I had to downclimb the routes that we did. I resolved to buy
a new rope -- I needed a new alpine 50 meter dry treated 9.5mm rope.
Anyway, the slab was great fun and it was beautiful.
We climbed an unnamed 4b route, then Scivolo, 4c, first pitch.

We went to down and tried to buy a rope, but everyone said we had
to go to Arco, and additionally, those shops would be closed until
3:30 in the afternoon. So we headed to Regina del Lago, where Jong and
I had climbed the week before.

We climbed:
* Zio Genio - pitch 1, 5c. Really nice...we did this twice.
* Una per Tutti - pitch 1 5a, pitch 2 5c, pitch 3 5c. This is a great little climb.

I thought Barbara did very well at this crag. The routes were harder than
she was used to. I saw that this is a great way to improve her climbing and
mine too.

Later we bought a rope and ate pizza in Arco, but the pizza was only so-so.
We watched a Columbo episode after dinner -- fun!

The next day, I took us to climb a multipitch route. However, Barbara wasn't
feeling great about it. The first pitch was easy, but she found it odd,
especially a short traverse. On the second pitch, she fell off the route,
and another person had to pull her back on! She arrived at the belay upset
with the whole thing. We had two pitches to go, but we decided to abseil,
which had it's complexities. Back at the start of the second pitch we
argued a bit. Her idea at that moment was that I should be able to
anticipate all such eventualities, and instead choose easier routes.
I countered that well, I already chose the very easiest routes, and have
little choice, and also, I'll never be a perfect judge of her
capabilities. She admitted that it wouldn't be any fun to have to worry
constantly about your partner.

We decided to take steps to improve, right then and there. I said that I'm
flattered to be her protector in whom she can rely. However, she has to have
a bit of the junkyard dog about her as well, when it comes to personal
safety. Falling off a route and hanging in space is really a no-go, and she
needs to take that on board. And it's no use to say that it "should be about
fun." Of course it's all about fun. But fun occurs inside the property guarded
by a fierce dog which ensures safety. The dog must be active not only in me,
but in her as well. We resolved to strengthen the dog in her, and also commit
to improving climbing skill.

I set up an intermediate belay so she could top rope the moves. She still had
to aid at a fixed sling, but gradually got better at sticking to the route.
We were so successful here, that I said we may as well try to finish the route.
However, the moves on pitch 3 were, in my judgment, simply too much. I reversed
the route after a polished V+ (UIAA) traverse. Then we went down. We continued
working on our plan and realized this situation ran not only through our climbing
style, but our whole relationship. Frankly, I was amazed at our power of
concentration, introspection and resolve-to-love.

But all that was quite hard, so we went to the Nago climbing area for some top-roping.

I led up "Giochi d'Ombra" (5c 22m), and Barbara did a great job top-roping it. We both
climbed it one more time. Then "Take it Easy" (5c 22m), which is just as interesting.
By the end of this one, Barbara was tired! We finished with "Cibele" (5a 15m), which
felt quite awkward at the top. Barbara called it good halfway.

Another so-so pizza, but a great Columbo. We felt so much love and good sport today
even though it was challenging.

For the last day, we headed back to Corno di Bo, this time climbing "Norex," 3 pitches
of 5a, 5a, and 4c. We met a nice couple, and teamed up with them to climb one more
pitch of "Tony il Telefonista" to top out below the telephone tower. We shared our
ropes for long rappels and came down nicely.

We finished our trip with a long walk along the water and a cappucino. Oh, I ordered
a grappa too and my God it was strong!

The ride home was mostly free of traffic. We had an absolutely wonderful time.
