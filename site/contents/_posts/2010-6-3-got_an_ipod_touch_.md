For Father's Day, Kris got me an iPod Touch. It's great fun! I've loaded
all kinds of neat apps onto it, and am planning to write some of my own.
It's a really nice platform for clean, simple, useful applications. I find
myself trying to avoid using the browser.
  
  
The first "Killer App" for me was Doodle Jump, which my boss introduced
me too a few weeks ago. A good German dictionary and Evernote are next.
After that is probably Brushes, which I installed today but am already
having lots of fun with. Here are my first drawings...
