### Wank, October 2005

After a great day of bike riding, rock climbing (very poorly on
my part), and eating Indian food with Ari and Matt, I was too
excited to sleep. So I left the house at 11:30 pm with two headlamps,
both with dying batteries. I hiked up the road to the start of the
hike up the "Mount Si" of Garmisch-Paternkirchen: Der Wank!



The hike was straightforward. I took a wrong turn at one point, ending
up at a Mittelstation lift, which cost about 20 minutes. Continuing,
I was impressed by the expanding views of the lights of the town
below. The stars were very beautiful too, with the cloudy arc of the
Milky Way directly overhead. At the top, I stood in a brisk wind
next to a high crucifix. Just wonderful.



On the way down I had to deal with a landslide that I had mysteriously avoided
before. For the life of me, I couldn't find the side trail I had used, and the
headlamps just got dimmer. Finally I committed to crawl and crab across it. I
did well until the last few feet before regaining trail: at that moment both
feet slid sickly into 2 feet of quicksand! My shoes were nearly sucked off as I
made the final steps to reach the trail. Here I was with a dim yellow headlamp,
in the Bavarian Alps, at 3 am, with an appointment in Munich at 9 am, struggling
to regain the trail! What a puzzle life is sometimes!
