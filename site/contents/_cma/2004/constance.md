* West Arete (5.6)
* September 26-27, 2004

It seemed like a good time to go visit Mount
Constance, one of the large and steep peaks in the Olympics. The
weather forecast was great, and we'd already had our eye on the
Olympics for a climb of Mount Olympus (we had to cancel that because
we couldn't all get Monday off of work). Some folks like Josh and
Theron ended up being busy, so it was Steve, Robert and myself.


Robert and I met Steve at the washout, then we crossed below the vertical cliffs
it created where the road used to be. "Looks like Smith Rocks," said Robert.


The bike ride up was really tedious, wearing out my thighs pre-maturely. 
Robert and  Steve were a good ways ahead. Eventually I realized that by 
raising my seat I could move  more efficiently (when your knees hit your elbows 
that is a sign). We stashed bikes  after an hour of riding and began hiking up 
the steep trail.


This was a great chance to re-unite with Steve, as our climbing paths haven't 
crossed in  well over a year. As we hiked, he told us about his recent trip to 
India. Robert and  Steve are both getting a lot of experience with outsourcing, 
and related a number of  interesting insights.


The trail to Constance Lake is really, really steep. It also passes a really 
interesting  apartment building. No wait...that's a moss-covered boulder! 
What long-ago creatures  scurried away when that fell down? Or maybe it's 
an erratic, brought down from Canada in  the ice age. Biggest rock I ever 
saw...


Above the picturesque lake we sat in the sun for a few hours, eating
and lounging.  A party of two came down the scree trail from Avalanche
Canyon. Tired and dusty, they gave us information about the
mountain. It was nice of them to rebuild some cairns on their descent,
as we had only vague notions about the way down.  We wandered down to
the lake, chose a camp and ate dinner. Steve and Robert did some
amazing rock skipping.  Darkness came before 8 pm, but there was a
bright moon and no mist.


Our party was on it's way by 6:30 am, needing headlamps for just a short 
distance up the  trail. The long trip up the canyon was uneventful: 
preturnaturally quiet and devoid of  wildlife. We recognized the "cat's ears"
where the normal route ascends the right side  of the canyon. Cliffs of The 
Thumb looked very imposing, and the rock walls on the left  slope were 
especially steep and interesting. Bubbly-looking rock awakened feelings of 
vague discomfort and curiousity.

Finally Crystal Pass was before us. I misjudged conditions and headed straight 
up an  enormous cone of scree and talus while Steve and Robert went around to 
the left. I  fought pitched battles with the slope: 2 steps forward 1 step 
back, as rocks cascaded  like water under my hands and feet. The merest 
touch would set off a slide that started  30 feet above me! Traversing 
over to my companions was difficult, and I arrived at the  pass some 
distance behind, shaking my head.


But the pass provided a great view of a crevassed glacier far below on the 
north side,  and Warrior Peak loomed across a gap. We uncoiled the rope and 
put on cold rock shoes  for the climb ahead. The West Arete wasn't looking 
much like an arete at first, more a  broad, gullied buttress. Robert started 
out first, climbing up and slightly rightward  for 4-5 ropelengths. Steve and 
I were near each other at the end of the rope, so we got  to talk affably 
about the rock and potential climbs on surrounding walls. In general,
protection on the route seemed sparse but adequate for the 4th class and 
occasional 5th  class terrain we climbed. Robert picked a good route, 
going left often enough to keep  from losing sight of the crest, but 
avoiding steep walls that mark the lower portion of  the buttress. We 
followed snaking gullies and short exposed faces, enjoying the quickly 
expanding view of walls to the right and the valley below. We did experience 
some rockfall in shallow chimneys, but the rock was (mostly) 
pleasantly solid.  We came to a confusing location where a tower rises on 
the left and on the right. When  you get right up next to it, you see that 
the right tower provides the correct route,  but until then it looks completely 
wrong. Robert endured our "second-guessing" from a position that gave the
impression he was climbing an isolated tower that would lead to a dead end! 
Steve and I were eventually reassured, and enjoyed climbing a steep hand crack
then face to the summit of the tower.


Weaving among a few gendarmes, we were soon at the base of a steep and imposing
wall. The Kearney book mentioned following a rotten ledge up and right for
20 feet. Once right at the base of the wall, this is very clearly seen. I led
off, placing good gear near the start, then clipping a piton at the end
of the ledge before turning straight up. This mostly-vertical pitch had some
great exposure, but solid rock and straightforward route-finding. I trended
left past some more old pitons and set a belay at the base of a chimney. There
are at least two pitons, a wedged block and a solid horn here, so it's an 
ideal belay spot. It looked pretty wild when Steve or Robert came into view
with steep cliffs all around.

The Kearney guide says to avoid climbing the chimney, so I continued up a
wide and interesting crack system to the left. Eventually I did enter the
chimney higher up, as it was a natural thing to do, and it provided some 
protection after 30 feet of easy face climbing. Next I followed a ledge
up and left, enduring "Fat Man's Misery" as I had to crouch on the ledge
under an overhang. By this time we were simul-climbing again. I climbed a
wall left of a steep open book. This led to more open, but loose and licheny
terrain, and finally I was above the wall and walking on low angle talus
slopes. Once on the crest again, I belayed Steve and Robert up and we stopped
for a snack and some pictures.

Robert then led us for a couple of 3rd and 4th class pitches along an airy
ridge to the summit ridge crest. We descended sunny slopes for 100 feet
to meet the normal route to the summit, unroping and continuing with minimal
gear (just lunch and a camera). It's pretty clever the way this route
traverses ledges to just below the summit block. We made an error at one
point, thinking we needed to hike down scree 200 feet and go around a buttress.
The climb back up that was pretty lame!

A short scramble gained the summit, where we could gaze at Mt. Olympus and
other peaks to the south and west. Seattle was socked in under a cloud sea,
but the volcanos north and east rose up beautifully. Great summit!

Retracing our steps, we picked up our gear and continued along a scenic
ridge to the "Finger Traverse," first climbed by 

Lionel Chute of Mt. Index fame. (There is a very interesting
story about Lionel Chute in the Northwest Mountaineering Journal,
available online at http://www.mountaineers.org/nwmj/041_Index.html)
Steve led out on the rope, finding it very easy. He belayed me across,
and Robert soloed it. It is basically a 5.0 move or two with a lot of exposure.
Handholds are very good.

More scenic ledges and then long descents of scree awaited us on the other side.
We enjoyed the stimulating route-finding. Crossing an icy snowfield made us
nervous at one point, but it went easily without special gear this time.
Eventually we started losing hundreds then thousands of feet in scree gullies,
and soon regained our morning trail in Avalanche Canyon.

Resting for a few minutes at the lake, we watched the fish jump for insects
at the surface. But soon we hurried down, worried about missing the last ferry
home. Indeed, Steve set a blistering pace down the steep and invigorating trail.
It's taken three days for my legs to recover from that long controlled fall!
We immediately got on the bikes and raced 5 miles down the road in what
seemed like 15 minutes to reach the car. Robert and I had time to get a beer
and a burger before taking the 8:30 ferry back to Edmunds, and Steve made
it home at a reasonably decent hour. Thanks to Robert, Constance and Steve for
a great weekend!
