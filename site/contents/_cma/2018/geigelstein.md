I hiked up the Geigelstein, and then went back down to the saddle between the
Geigelstein and the Breitenstein. Then I went up the Breitenstein, descended to the
south and returned to my ascent valley for a self-service Dunkelweissbier at the
hut. Some Americans were having a wedding, heh!

It began to rain as I hiked, skipped and ran down. 1350 meters up and down.
