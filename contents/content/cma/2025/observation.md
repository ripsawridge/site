For our first hike in the Sawtooths, Steve and I chose Observation Peak,
reachable by good trail from the Grandjean Campground. We loved the alpine
country, though we were surprised how often we had to cross the river!
I think we made it up on logs, but on the way down we just waded across
the river at one point, since one of the crossings had been sketchy.

On the descent, it got pretty hot. We ran into a couple starting the
Grand Loop tour, which takes between 4 and 6 days. They were travelling
pretty light, but we didn't envy them starting so late in the day, when
the heat became rather oppressive, at least on this day.

Also, I touched "Cow's Parsnip," and the oil from this plant got on the
straps of my hiking poles. If this oil is on you and your skin is exposed
to sun, the skin will swell up alarmingly. This happened to me, so by the
evening I could barely see my knuckles, and the skin felt stretched tight
like a balloon. It took a good three days before the swelling started going
down. Watch out for this plant, which grows near river crossings in the
area.

A great first trip, though!
