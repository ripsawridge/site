*Date is approximate*

Rowan and I went to Nice for the school break. We had a nice little apartment.
I remember it was quite cold, but he was determined to jump in the pool.
He did it too! I did not have the courage...

We only spent a short time in the city itself. We ate a gourmet meal that cost
100 euros. Ugh. Terrible. Food not very good. After that we were happy with
cooking for ourselves and getting a pizza now and then...

We did two spectacular hikes. First up to the Pas de l'Arpette from the la Gordolasque
valley. A day or so later up the other side of the valley to the Cime de Prais.

Thanks to Rowan for patience with me dragging him up there!
