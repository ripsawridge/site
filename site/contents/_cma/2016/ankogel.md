The boys and I completed an amazing 6 day traverse of the Ankogel Mountains
at the start of their school vacation. We had a lot of fun. They are
the best hiking companions you could ask for.

We spent two nights in a "self service" mountain hut, and three nights in
huts with food and a warden.

I wrote about the trip on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@ripsawridge/the-ankogel-mountains-6ae7ecf977c4#.buzxhuede), enjoy!
