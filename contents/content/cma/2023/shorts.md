### Martinswand with Werner and Helmut
_May 18, 2023_

Werner, Helmut and I climbed [Emmentaler](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/emmentaler-martinswand/) and then [Bronchitis](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/bronchitis-martinswand/). A very nice
use of Father's Day. As it turns out, we are all dads. :)

### Point 2265
_May 7, 2023_

I hiked from the town of Walten to the summit of Point 2265 (my name for it,
though there is a summit cross). I followed roads up to the west, then trail
from the Fleckner Hütte. A bit of scrambling at the end to reach the top.
The peak Fleckner looked difficult without boots and maybe an ice ax.

Views to mountains in the northwest were spectacular. I'd like to explore that
area more...1120 meters up/down.

### Mutspitze
_May 6, 2023_

A great walk from my hotel in Dorf Tirol to the summit of the Mutspitze.
Two weeks before, I attempted it, but deep snow turned me around.

From the summit, I thought about traversing the ridgetop to the Taufenscharte
and descending it to the Leiter Alm, but the snow looked unappealing. I'm
so allergic to snow these days! So I retraced my steps. What a beautiful summit.

1941 meters up/down.

### Glaitner Joch (attempt)
_May 5, 2023_

I hiked from a little museum building a bit above the town of Sankt Leonhard
towards the pass. A nice man let me park, essentially, in his yard where
he was doing carpentry. He was there when I got back too, and also let me
have water from his spring. Really nice, because I was dying of thirst.

Snow stopped me about 150 meters below the pass. It was knee deep soft
stuff. Reminded me of the San Juans last year. Quite interesting, the near-vertical
town of Glaiten, whose yards I huffed and puffed through between clearings in
the forest. The high meadows were gorgeous. I love the brown grass of
this Texel-adjacent region. 1534 meters up/down.

### Mutspitze (attempt)
_April 22, 2023_

I found myself in Meran, and attempted to hike from town to the Mutspitze.
However, snow on the upper ridge got me to turn around. A great dinner of
Knödel in Dorf Tirol afterwards! Then a walk down through the vineyards
as the sun went down.

Still, 2000 meters up/down.

### Gantkofel
_early April, 2023_

Before meeting Jong for a climbing trip, I had a partial day. So I
hiked and scrambled up the Gantkofel through a narrow, icy gully to the Kematscharte.
Then down a different
*scharte* (pass/gully) which was still very steep! 1300 meters up/down.

### Heimgarten
_January, 2023_

A fun hike after staying overnight with Alexander in Weilheim for his birthday
celebration. Lots of fresh snow, and snowing on and off. Up the normal route,
where folks at the Murnau DAV Huette invited me in to eat lunch! Down via
the long ridge, sometimes breaking trail in deep snow.

### Stanser Joch
_January 7, 2023_

I'd never done the hike straight up from the town of Stans. It was fantastic!
I thought it would be 1500 meters up through *latschen* but it was pleasant,
if very steep, forest and occasional meadow. Only in the last 300 meters were
there periods of time spent in the *latschen*, and of course the final 150 meters
were wide open. I enjoyed a chat with a woman who lived in Schwaz, hiking up
here from home, preferring not to drive anywhere.

### Scheffauer
_January 6, 2023_

A great hike up Scheffauer from the south. I carried snowshoes up to the point
it was clear I didn't need them. I was glad for hiking boots on tricky, icy
steep parts in the last 200 meters to the summit. Beautiful day. Pictures to
come...

### Plessenberg
_January 1, 2023_

A great hike up Plessenberg from the Ascherjöchl, then down the west side
to the Jocheralm and to the ground. I listened to the great album
[Static Deviations](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1) by Jameson Nathan Jones.
