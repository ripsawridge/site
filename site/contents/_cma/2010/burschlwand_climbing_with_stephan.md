On the spur of the moment, Stephan and I were able to get out for a day.
Friday was expected to be nice until the late afternoon, then the weekend
rains would start! I convinced him to make the long drive to the Burschlwand,
which Adrian and I had really enjoyed a few weeks before. I liked the climbs
there so much, I was at least as interested in repeating routes we'd done
as doing new ones. Adrian and I did the last pitches of "Mon Cheri" (VII-)
last time, and a good start seemed to be to do that whole line. At 8:45
am, Stephan was leading up the first pitch, nicely climbing through some
crux (7-) moves on small holds. "This is really pumpy!" he said a couple
of times. After running through the short pitch 2 as well, Stephan sent
me off for pitch 3, which seemed to get harder as it went up. A vertical
wall, I found the holds getting smaller and smaller until finally a committing
leftward hand traverse escapes to the belay. What a steller pitch!
  
  
Like my previous trip to the Burschlwand, I found myself replaying the
pitch in my mind. Despite the rather lackluster appearance of the cliff,
almost every pitch offers creative moves.
  
  
Stephan lead pitch 4, graciously using the optional belay station mid-pitch
to allow me to lead the top part. These two 30 meter pitches are often
combined, but last time I enjoyed it so much on follow that I wanted a
chance to lead some of it. It offered continually interesting face climbing,
sometimes made easier by being able to grab a prominent edge on the left.
Stephan took pitch 6 via a nice face climb that reached the top of the
wall.
  
  
We came down and hung out in the shade near the car for a while drinking
water and eating chocolate, which had already melted in the heat of the
day. We'd taken about 3 hours for 6 pitches. "That's pretty pathetic!"
said Stephan. "I didn't know we were racing," I replied. My thought was
that these were all tough pitches, it was our first climb together outside,
and well...the day is long! Still, we resolved to see if we could speed
up a bit.

Next we hiked back up to climb "Stenico," again grade VII-. I got the
easy first pitch, then Stephan climbed a surprisingly tough buttress that
looked easy from below. "You should skip clips!" I said, or something to
that affect. But once up there I was amazed how terrain that appeared lackluster
from below turned into bulgy overhangs and vertical walls. "Good lead!"
I said, then combined pitches 3 and 4\. I ran out of steam at the crux moves
on pitch 4 and had to rest a moment.
  
  
I'd tried to pass a slabby section to the left of protection, only to
get into trouble trying to go up and traverse right on small features.
After a rest I made it work, but watching Stephan later it appeared the
better way was to avoid getting so far left as I had. This was a good pitch.
Stephan continued up the slabby buttress to a belay below an overhang.
Gulp!

Interesting moves sent me right below the overhang, then back left. I
thought I should climb it on the left, but that didn't work. After a rest
I finally figured out that there is a decent incut hold right in the heart
of the overhang that would allow me to reach high for a slabby palm with
my left hand. That cracked it, then I wended my way slightly right and
up on the crest of an outside corner, deciding to keep going through pitch
7 to the top. Stephan came up and we talked with some guys who'd been climbing
HeSi on the right. What's more they had established that route and others
here! We thought about calling it a day, but with blue sky and hours of
daylight left we couldn't justify leaving work early! Besides, we'd climbed
faster...that was 7 pitches in 2.5 hours.

Another scamper back to the base of the wall followed, and this time we
drove into town for a sandwich. We hung out at the chapel fountain some
more, eating, drinking and talking with some other climbers. Even though
Adrian and I already climbed "Donna Delores" (6+), I wanted to do it again.
Stephan agreed, and at 4:45 pm he was leading the first pitch. I was worried
about pitch 2, which I found really hard a few weeks ago. Nervously asking
Stephan to watch me closely, I took a big leftward step out from the belay
to the highly chalked foothold that provides access to the wall. I went
up and right to a hopeless rotten overhang, then tentatively traversed
back left on slabby pinches until I could make the second clip. "Not out
of the woods yet," I thought. Straight up from here on small holds got
the third clip, then I could relax a bit. I traversed right, then used
a shallow seam to aid upward progress until finally the route exits to
a belay on the left. Whew!
  
  
Now, Stephan would get the joy of leading my favorite pitch on the wall
so far. Rated 6, it is nonetheless sustained and long, with several puzzles
to solve as it climbs up and left on a broad wall. He did this very well,
and was already raving about the quality as he reached the belay. I could
only respond "I know, yeah?!" having fallen in love with the pitch a few
weeks ago with Adrian. I had marred the lead by traversing too far left
to another line that day, then engaging in a series of traverses and hijinks
to get back on the line. Stephan made no such mistake, and even got some
nice pictures of me showing the climbing sequence on different sections.
The last pitch of the route proper was for me, and I had a great time slinking
up the wall to an appointment with a yellow rotted-looking overhang that
is escaped via a slabby jug on the left. Despite getting a hand on the
jug, there is nothing helpful for feet, and it makes for an exciting end
to an already-strenuous pitch. Stephan got pitch 5, an easy ridge that
dovetails with the "Mon Cheri" route.
  
  
Sore, tender feet and fingers aside, it was an excellent climbing day.
Thanks Stephan!
