Barbara and I changed our goal at the last minute from something in
the Dammkar to the Alpspitze when we saw the lift was open.
We took the first lift up and had a great time climbing the
lower half of KG Weg (IV+). The upper half was buried in snow, so
we hiked down the via ferrata, then decided to go on down to
the Höllentalangerhütte for some food and drink (well, mainly me!).
Barbara loved the canyon walls and scenic view of the Zugspitze.

I think this is belaying for the second pitch.

Coming up a really enjoyable and delicate slab.

Great scenary at the end of the first half of the route.

A similar shot.

Me with a strange expression, Barbara with a good one!

I'm apologizing for something here!

Barbara is looking at a wedding proposal that might happen soon.

We thought about waiting but didn't know when it would come.

On the descent trail.

Me at a blasted out section of the trail.

{% image /cmaimages/2020/IMG_3404.jpg %}
Ah, we are happy.

{% image /cmaimages/2020/IMG_3405.jpg %}
I love the valley walls in here, quite unique!

{% image /cmaimages/2020/IMG_3406.jpg %}
The tunnels...

Goodbye!

But what really excited her was yet to come: the Klamm! Amazingly,
she'd never been in it. So we headed in and she was blown away by
all the waterfalls and dramatic canyons, tunnels and bridges.
Her smile was wonderful.

After this, we ran downhill somewhat, me with a rope on my back
and her with a pack. It was a long descent, but soon we were
on the flats and walking back to the car at the lift station.

A good full day in the mountains!
