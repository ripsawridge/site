*I never had patience for poetry but tonight I made this. The first line is a
cliche, but oh well.*

<center>
If you wake to find me gone.<br/>
Don't think I didn't enjoy it.<br>
That I didn't enjoy all that you are.<br>
And want for you all that *will* arrive.<br>
But I've always ghosted the party.<br/>
My comings and goings are the least of things.<br>

<br/>

I send me away, so that I may return.<br/>
I don't claim to understand.<br/>
And who needs to understand everything?<br/>
<br/>
I like to be warm. In the room with you.<br/>
And then I like to feel the cold night, and her stars.<br/>
<br/>
I was hurt that the critics disliked Thomas Kincaid.<br/>
"Trite rubbish," they declared.<br/>
<br/>
But why are warm golden windows in a cold night rubbish?<br/>
They are always a good thing.<br/>
Even if they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Your song is a good thing.<br/>
For the unfolding of you I will avert my eyes.<br/>
I would not breathe! if it would disturb...<br/>
I will open the door softly.<br/>
I will close the door softly.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have a smell, but I wish I did.<br/>
That could be my lingering name!<br/>
