Lately, Elijah has been asking me to take him to work with me. So on Saturday
both boys hopped in the stroller and we rode towards work. We stopped for
some breakfast pastries, and then lay down a picnic blanket on the amazing
new park right behind the Rathaus (City Hall). It's just a nice green lawn
with some trees and sunny places in the middle of the city. We ran around,
and then there was a little tourism event for the Tirol region in Austria.
Each boy got a green soccer ball, some sausage, some water and bread. Oh
and a cute flag to wave.

We went to work and they enjoyed running down the spacious hallway. We
played Mike's guitar, plugging it into the amp and turning it up, I hope
we didn't disturb anyone! Sure was nice to hear a loud, overdriven guitar
though. :-)
  
  
Then it was a nice big playground on the way home from work. Rowan boldly
climbed a 15 foot high ladder to a tower, and Elijah overcame a fear about
crossing a thick rope bridge. I'm trying to get them to learn to push themselves
on the swings, but no luck so far.
  
  
I stopped at the climbing book store, but it was too hard to get the boys
to stand still. Rowan knocked over a 215 Euro globe! Happily it was ok.
Let's get out of here!
  
  
Then we went into the beautiful yellow church at Odeonsplatz. The boys
were very quiet and respectful, just whispering about the cherubs high
on the walls. We called them "babys."
  
  
Rowan kept saying "go in yellow house!" Then I looked. There was a "prevent
diabetes" fair on the Odeonsplatz, and sure enough there was a blow-up
yellow castle for kids to jump in. We had to take that in, and the boys
were laughing up a storm for 30 minutes as they bounced and fell in the
house. It was time to go, but they did not want to leave! In fact the attendant
was pulling them out because he decided they'd been in too long ("we have
to alternate big and small children," he said). Oh the crying! Lots of
looks of either sympathy or alarm, I never have the time to find out which
is which. I carried one back to the stroller and the other just walked
and cried. Too bad!
  
  
But then at home they got to watch a movie for 10 minutes before taking
a nap, and they were pretty tired so it was okay.
  
  
The day before we'd all (including Kris) rented a boat after I got off
work and pedaled around on a lake in the Englisch Garten. We all loved
that.
  
  
Anyway, I'm just really impressed with Munich as a kid-friendly city,
I'm discovering new attractions every weekend.
