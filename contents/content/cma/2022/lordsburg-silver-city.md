## April 25, day 5 - 23.2 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day5.jpg %}
An intimidating journey across a desert and into mountains. Through, then
down to a camp beside highway 90.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220425_055310.jpg %}
Heading out of Lordsburg, 5:45 am.

It was great to finally be going north of Lordsburg! Gogo and Blueberry had the
room next to mine and the walls are thin enough that when they woke up, I woke
up. They've been traveling at a similar pace to Slim and I, but with a curious
schedule... From 4 am to 11, then again from 6 or 7 pm to 11 pm or so. Once I
woke up in the night thinking cars were driving on the road far away, but they
were the headlamps of Gogo and Blueberry. I rolled over and went back to
sleep... No need to holler out at people late at night!

It's great the way our paths cross and recross. We can always recognized Slims
enormous feet and huge stride. Information travels up and down the path. The
feeling of community is amazing.

So Slim and I headed north, then east across often trackless desert, always
climbing gently. It was beautiful the way Lordsburg receded, and multiple days
of the hot, blasted country we'd been through opened up. Big Hatchet Mountain
shimmered blue in the far distance, no longer the forbidding peak towering over
us. We headed towards Apache Mountain, and the sun slowly gained dominion over
the land.

I lost the trail in here and stumbled upon this.

I followed the wrong track at some point and ended up well off the normal
route. I followed a road south to rejoin. There are markers every so often on
the horizon, and footprints in the sand keep you on the right track usually.
Desert washes are where I usually went wrong, as several paths exit. I saw a
cute pair of road runners in here... Little walking birds that move forward
with purpose, then hesitate in an endearing way... In unison.

Slim and I met up again after an hour, when the trail turned up in a braid of
sandy roads and washes. We were making for the "engineers well," the first of
three water sources on this stretch. I met Dragonsky in here, a young lady from
New Jersey. We got to the well and found a nearly empty tank with a few dozen
bees swarming around it... And clear, running water!

Despite the bees, I reached in among them and filled my water bladder. Then I
sat down to filter the water next to Slim in the shade. Over the next days Slim
told me about his hike of the PCT four years ago. It was great, but he had to
dodge fire closures for the last 70 miles in the North Cascades. Some of his
urgency to push rapidly forward is based on the reasonable fear of fire
closures later in the season.

"Automatic" water filtering at the Engineer's Well.

Only a mile after the well, Slim and I hit a major milestone, the first hundred miles! We climbed up into ridges of shattered granite, and increasingly, trees!

The 100 mile marker in the Gold Hills.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220425_140115~2.jpg %}
A bigger 100 mile marker. I was proud!

In the Gold Hills, beyond the Engineer's Well.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03799.jpg %}
The first big rock of the trip!

I made sure to stop after every 2 hours to take shoes and socks off. In this
country, there was an active mine down below us, so it didn't feel like complete
wilderness. Nonetheless, it was hot and sandy, though the occasional tree promised
better country to come.

In some up and down country near Hornbrook Mountain, somebody made a little
"sign" to make you laugh.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220425_165242.jpg %}
In a light forest, the ground looks like this. Quite spiny for blow-up air
mattresses!

A wonderful evening courtesy of a real trail angel, Solo!

In the evening, Silm and I dropped down to highway 90 and the rumour of a
trail angel named Solo who might have some Gatorade. Sure enough, she was
there! She had two chairs, and insisted Slim and I sit in them. I tried to
demur and sit on the big mat she had laid out, but she was ready for that. "I
still won't sit in the chair," she said.

We three had a great conversation about Elon Musk, about censorship, about the
felt presence of God or "whatever you want to call it" in the mountains. Solo
said that she was transformed by the experience of raising a son with autism...
She had to change herself in order to be closer to him, and the change was
deeply for the better. Slims wife Tor is an energy healer, and we discussed the
definition of the term "new age," about what we like and dislike about it. Slim
shared a beautiful story of how he met Tor.

Patches and Emma came by at this point in the dark, exchanged a few words
and kept moving a bit further (but why skip a great campground?). I'd see
this nice pair often in the weeks ahead.

Finally, Solo offered us tequila shots and sent us off to bed down in the
trees. The milky way and shooting stars sent me to sleep. So ended the first
day of the second leg.

## April 26, day 6 - 20 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day6.jpg %}
Up from the highway and over Burro Peak. Down an interesting side canyon
to a camp by the road and the Tyrone Mine.

[Slim's Blog](https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/649678) has some
good details about this day. I woke up with rabbits looking at me, asking
if it's time to go...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03802.jpg %}
Climbing above highway 90 in the dawn. The true divide is off in the distance,
I'll rejoin it later in the afternoon. Lordsburg was, in fact, a multi-day
detour.

I was impressed by very green plants after days of brown.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03807.jpg %}
Looking back to the Gold Hills (I think!).

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220426_085458.jpg %}
Mmm...water. Slim prepares to filter.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220426_122445.jpg %}
The first trail sign on a tree! I was loving this forest so much.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03810.jpg %}
Beauty! To be in the pine forest of Burro Peak was an incredible feeling.

Slim on Burro Peak.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220426_125656.jpg %}
And me. This was the first peak of the trip, 8022 feet high.

We came down from the summit to a small spring which would have
to provide all the water until Silver City, so we tanked up! My plan was
to avoid going further west to the Burro Mountain Homestead and instead
follow Deadman Canyon out to the road by the Tyrone Mine.

Slim decided to join me, because it seemed like an interesting alternate
way. We followed a cart track down for about half a mile, then had to
boldly turn away from it and head into trailless forest. With Slim in
front, I kept the phone up to make sure we were on the right bearing.
After only 15 minutes or so, we reached tread that we followed several
miles to the road. This was great fun!

After miles on the road we reached the junction with highway 90 in the
evening. My feet hurt so much! We made a hidden camp behind a fence in
some scrub brushes.

Go Go and Blueberry came along at this point and decided to stay here, too.
Great fun chatting with them for a while in the evening. And then, even
one more person came...a guy from Croatia who is biking the divide. Now
it was full dark and the camp was full!

In the night a border patrol truck came and parked near us, idling for over
an hour. It went away at 2 am on the dot, and returned briefly an hour later.
They have huge cameras mounted on poles. I suppose they knew we were there
and didn't care.

Out of the interesting Deadman Canyon, on the long road that borders the
Tyrone Mine.

## April 27, day 7 - 12.6 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day7.jpg %}
A peaceful road walk in the morning north to town.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03814.jpg %}
A long walk starting before dawn on highway 90. The mountains ahead cheered
me up, though!

Here is an excerpt from the blog, I don't think I can add more to it:

> I can report the trail is damn fun, too. Even this morning, getting up at 4:30
> to make a 12 mile road walk...I exulted in the stars overhead, and the distant
> lights of Silver City on the plain far below. I have many, and growing
> resources in the form of sinew, experiences, and friends I can ask a favor
> from.
> 
> Slowly I become EQUAL to the trail, and by this process I may rise above it
> again, back to the land of dreams where my real home is. Dreams must have a
> basis in reality from which to launch. Since my old dreams were out of true
> with the reality of the CDT, they had to die. But seeds have been planted in
> fertile ground, and like the phoenix...I will rise!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220427_063250.jpg %}
Slim sets off, soon getting far ahead on long legs!

A homeowner along highway 90 has a sense of humor!

I meet our driver to the border! He lives in El Paso, and would begin hiking
the trail in a few weeks. Really cool guy.

Cemetery in Silver City.

What a beautiful courthouse. And the green lawn!

As graceful as the townspeople are friendly...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220427_103105.jpg %}
I can relax a bit!

I stayed in a hostel with a kitchen and several laundry machines.
I'd have my own room to sleep in! Also, there was a computer
which I took full advantage of to write down a bundle of memories
and thoughts about the trip so far. I never really got used
to writing blog entries on my phone.

Blueberry was having a problem with her foot. She had a big blister
right on the pad under the ball of the foot. Acting as a trail angel,
our driver from the border was in town, and he made a trip to the
pharmacy for her. Since she's a medical student, she was able to
phone in a "bespoke" order for her situation, which, I think,
included antibiotics. It seemed like a rather serious situation
overall.

But, she and Go Go also cooked a great vegan dinner. I helped out by
paying for supplies. It was fun sitting around the table,
with the young ladies bustling around in the kitchen and telling
stories of their first hiking experiences. It had a feeling
of "home" or normalcy that I missed.

Clean clothes do a LOT to aid that feeling, too. I was wandering
around in pants way too big for me from the hiker box while I
waited for my clothes to dry.

A "hiker box" is a place where people leave things they didn't need.
Many people found a replacement for something they'd lost earlier,
like a part of a water filter. On the rest of the trip, at a hotel
or hostel, I'd always paw through the hiker box on the off chance
I'll say "oh wow!" and come away with a great find.

## April 28, day 8

Rest day! Sleeping in late was just incredible.

I joined up with a group of people going to a late breakfast.
I irritated the table by defending Jeff Bezos who they'd consigned
to the ranks of the demonic. It wasn't the first time I'd feel
called to do that! All of these young people were full of the idea
that capitalism was evil, and that guy in particular exemplified
the evil.

They had no perspective on their privilged situation in the West.
They had all the latest high-tech devices, expensive cameras and
gear. They wanted for nothing at all. And yet looked around with
bitterness at the whole thing. They were able to take 6 months off
from earning a living to come do this, but somehow, the structure
of our society was awful in their minds. My thought was simply:
if it is so very bad, why are we reveling in so much good fortune?

Nobody wants to hear this. In fact, to say these things paints
a target on your back. You become the defender of that hated thing:
the status quo. You are speaking because you actually feel
gratitude for what is, but they think you are insincere...that you
are a "paid shill" for the oppressive systems of near-slavery
that "crowd all around them."

But oh well, you learn new things always. And the breakfast was
insanely good. Also, one of the people there was an extremely
talented photographer.

I started my chores. First shopping and shipping a box up the
trail to Pie Town.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220428_105506~2.jpg %}
My first rest day. I'm making a box to ship to Pie Town.

With a gang of other folks, I went out to dinner at a brew pub
in town. Food was, of course, amazing. We came back and jumped
in the hot tub at the hostel. Here I met Mishap for the first
time. I was impressed with her modern blue hair. Me being me,
I started arguing why atheism makes so sense.

But I couldn't disturb the free-wheeling atmosphere. I chatted
with Lemonhope and we planned to leave together early in the
morning.

At the pub, I also had a great talk with Blue Jay, the nice lady
from day 3 on the trail. That was another slice of normalcy
and companionship...one of the best evenings of the trail.
