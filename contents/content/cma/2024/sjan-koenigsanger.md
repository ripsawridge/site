Nice hike up Königsanger from Verdings. I got a hitch down from the official
parking lot back to Verdings from a nice cross-country skiing fella who
lives in Feldthurns down the road. He grew up nearby, nice guy. I used
snowshoes for the upper half, though snow became wet, deep and heavy on
the way down. Day started out sunny, later with ominous clouds.
