I'm okay with the world.<br/>
<br/>
I really am. I am completely okay. My resentments are dissolving. I feel where they used to be, and what is there now is only joy.<br/>
<br/>
My road is my road. I would walk No Other. I am What I Am. And I love being here.<br/>
<br/>
I have only love.<br/>
<br/>
I want only that each one out there unfolds their magic.<br/>
Their magic, better than my magic.<br/>
I have no magic.<br/>
I am nothing, really.<br/>
<br/>
Unfold!<br/>
Lovers and passerby.<br/>
Grasshoppers and pigs looking out at the moon.<br/>
How could I improve on you?<br/>
<br/>
I witness you.<br/>
This is all!<br/>
I could never ask for more.<br/>
<br/>
Because only to See.<br/>
The Joy inside Seeing burned away all that was separate in me.<br/>
At least for a while.<br/>
I know I am tricky.<br/>
I know I "will be back."<br/>
My goal is that each time I come back smaller.<br/>
Less than all that I see.<br/>
Something small in a big and beautiful world.<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand me?<br/>
No man will see the face of God.<br/>
There never was a man.<br/>
But there is the Seeing.<br/>
Beyond wanting.<br/>
Beyond.<br/>
Keep climbing, my loves.<br/>
All parts of you burn away.<br/>
In lovely fire.<br/>
Sweet fire.<br/>
Fire that releases you...<br/>
<br/>
Your home is everywhere and nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
