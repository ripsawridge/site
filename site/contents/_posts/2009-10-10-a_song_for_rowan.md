A few weeks ago Rowan came home with a drawing of a butterfly. I was playing
the piano when he showed it to me, trying to grok the chord progressions
of Wintersun, my current favorite band. I made this little song from that
dual inspiration. Check it out [here](http://www.mountainwerks.org/mwmusic/songs/Rowan of the Hills.mp3).
If you can't understand the lyrics, here they are:
  
---  

>   
> A butterfly from the northlands
>   
> Came down on tired wings
>   
> Bearing tidings of woe and pain.
>   
>   
> Trolls from the eastern hills,
>   
> Surprised our host.
>   
> One hero held them off,
>   
> Rowan was his name.
>   
>   
> Rowan cared for the Old Ones,
>   
> Kind and open-hearted,
>   
> Calming the fears of the younglings
>   
> As the host arrived.
>   
>   
> With ring of steel and battle cry,
>   
> His men stood firm.
>   
> Ever nearer pressed the Host,
>   
> They breached the Outer Wall.
>   
>   
> Though their Age has ended,
>   
> Signs of truth remain:
>   
> When you see a butterfly,
>   
> Rowan was his name.
>   
>   
> Rowan was his name.
>   
> 

  
  
Rowan likes it a lot and is always playing the piano version. We'll see
if he can stand my horrible singing! :-)
