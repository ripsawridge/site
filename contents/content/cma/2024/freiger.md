I'd met Louise a week before on Habicht, and she gave me a spare
"Seven Summits of the Stubai" logbook for me to stamp on the summit.
Cool! As it turned out, she spent the next days climbing at least 5
others. So when she suggested that we team up for the Wilder Freiger,
I knew I'd have an energetic partner for the climb. I already knew she
was an interesting and cheerful person from our delightful conversation
on Habicht. Let's go!

We met at the parking lot for the Nürnberger Hütte at 6 am, and were soon
walking up. Lots to talk about -- amazing how that makes the elevation
fly by. We took the rightmost variation on a steep slope, seemingly
created by sheep herders to access broad, grassy slopes.

The hut wardens were in house-cleaning mode when we got there, but they
consented to give us a *Milchkaffee* to drink in a corner while they
swept and moved chairs around. The climbers had been up and away for a few
hours when we got there (probably around 8:15). Louise bought the drinks,
and I astounded her with my perfect guess that the cost would be 7 euros.
For my part I was surprised to be right...I mean, the cups were not very
big!

We rounded a basin then climbed steeply in switchbacks. I was holding
forth on the utterly benighted worldview of the crop of
"Hamas" protesters on college campuses these days, gradually recognizing
the bemused expressions on the faces of the folks we were climbing through.
We were pretty fast somehow, probably fueled by intense discussion!
Soon we were crossing short snowfields above the *Seescharte*, then
descending to a broad snowfield with a shallow frozen lake in the center.

There was a good bit of traffic up here, because several multi-day hiking
routes pass through this area. We met two women from Israel doing the
Stubai Traverse and wished them well. The sun remained hidden, and
we had to dress up a bit for wind protection.

After the lake, we got onto a ridge with occasional narrow sections,
sometimes protected by a wire. Peaks and glaciers became our siblings.

Louise was new to snow climbing, so it was with a mix of curiosity and
apprehension that we approached a step-kicking slope to meet
a plateau below the summit ridge. We both had lightweight crampons for
running shoes. Louise had "boots" which were pretty cool for their
ankle support but I don't think they were much different from the
lightweight running shoes we both preferred. It's unfortunate for us who
love lightweight gear, but when there is a lot of snow, or even a little
snow that is steep, real "clodhoppers," that is, heavy boots with a
full steel shank are the thing for permanent snowfields. We'd gambled that
we could get away without all that, and this was fine. But if we'd been
in the month of May it would be different!

So we kicked steps up for 30 meters or so, then made some new steps to
work around an icy, gravelly section. After another short snowfield, we
were on the plateau, and the "crux" of the day was complete. Cool!

Thirty minutes later, after a scenic ridge scramble, we were on top.
I was fascinated by the Becherhaus, which had been "seized" by the
fascist Italian government in 1922. I think that was unusual. Normally
the world of alpine clubs were left alone. It's the first time I heard
anything like that. On the summit a man said this was our "Austrian sadness."
He and another guy had brought up cans of beer to drink on top.
Neat! We all took turns taking pictures for each other.
The sun wasn't really out yet, but patches of blue were increasing in
the sky, and the views kept improving. Of course, Louise and I proudly punched our
stamps!

(She only has one summit to go now, and a handsome wooden plaque awaits...
I'm excited now too, and plan to spend a few weekends in the fall on this
project, hmpf!)

After enjoying the views a bit more, we headed down.

*The summit attracts a crowd!*

There was a "toll house" on the plateau, half falling apart.
How terrible to be the toll collector up there...I fear I would
become morally lax, and allow the smugglers bribe me with
whiskey and pipe tobacco.

*Faffing about with gear*

We strode confidently down the snowfield, as one must for good purchase,
then put the spikes away. At that point the sun came out, heck yeah.

Louise carried a small pack but somehow had the right clothing
at every moment. There are at least three outfits at different points,
some achieved by creative yet practical combinations. I laughed looking
at our pictures later, because she always looks perfectly suited, while
I have a kind of "transit authority employee" look.

Except for this picture. I think I look correct here:

*Approaching the hut*

I was hoping for *Kaiserschmarnn* at the hut but the kitchen was closed.
Louise said too bad they don't have a *DURCHGEHENDE WARME KÜCHEN*, which
made me laugh because I'd been joking about a kind of 1960s German
asthetic of stolidly built structures and restaurants that advertised
a "continously warm kitchen" like it was a fantastic innovation.

Apparently it really *is* a great innovation, and has not yet come
to the high country of the "Austrian sadness!"

So we just got some drinks and headed out. Maybe I got some cake? I forgot.

To distract myself from weariness, I got ahead of Louise and played a game
of trying to *stay* ahead (not easy with her), and succeeded until I
collapsed on a bench 20 minutes above the car park. It was kind of amazing
how much more varied and beautiful the terrain below the hut was in
the sunny early evening, but it was LONG TOO!

What a great time. Big thanks to Louise for the suggestion, and I look forward
to the dispersment of wooden plaques (hopefully in a solemn ceremony in
the Neustift *Rathaus*), and to a future trip in high snow and rocks.
