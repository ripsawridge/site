title: Why I still blog

I've blogged rarely since about 2004, when I came late to the bandwagon
("why not just write a page in html, duh?"), and now that it's a much rarer
activity, find myself doing it more than ever. I always thought something
else would come along and be the new way for me to transmit thoughts into
the world. For a while, I was really active on sites like Summitpost.org,
and Facebook. But the former is too narrow-band for my scatterbrained interests
(sometimes politics, or synth music, or guitars, or climbing, or a family
trip, or...), and the latter is...well. I mean, I use Facebook all the
time, and still like it. But the thought that they just own everything
I put up there bugs me more. Summitpost is different, they explicitly state
all the time that it's **your** content and you can remove it at any time.
It depresses me to contribute so much to a corporate juggernaut that's
going to remix my 2009 thoughts endlessly and derive profit from them.
It's even more depressing that I don't pull the plug on them completely.
  
  
So this is my little rebellion. If I've got something worth saying, that
I think is worth keeping, at least for a while, I'll put it here on the
ol' blog. I know...so 2006!

Hmm...I should probably read the blogspot terms of service...
  
  
Another complaint about Facebook...I'm trying to make any time I spent
"for fun" on the computer more productive. It's all time I'm stealing from
family, from exercise, from real-life visits with friends, and that needs
to be remembered (if occasionally ignored :(). After an hour of "Facebookin',"
what do you have? You learned your friends trivia, and I've got no problem
with that. This won't be a rant about trivia. I actually think it's important
and a way to know the texture of a person's life if you can't really see
them very often. I think any danger is more that of a Facebooker self-censoring
to fit an image they've constructed. This happens...have you ever thought
you knew something about a friend only to find out later via some other
medium that they quit their job and went back to school 2 months ago? Ouch.
Meanwhile their Facebook feed just continues the stream you've grown used
to. So I do think that is a problem.
  
  
Anyway, sorry for the tangent. But after I've watched peoples funny videos,
read their good links, made my occasional comments here and there, then
I wonder where did the evening go? So, "productive" computer fun-time is
the answer. For me this is
  

* Writing reports of mountain adventures (hey, it's how the whole "internet"
started for me :))
* Writing songs and sharing them
* (Lately) transcribing guitar parts from songs I like and sharing them
* Making a movie or song about the kids
* Writing some kind of article
* Dreaming up new things to do
My thinking is that all of these activities at least leave something new
in the world, even if it's only interesting to me. Along the way I hopefully
get better at something too.
