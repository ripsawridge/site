Look, Kris made me this amazing sweater, in just 9 days of constant knitting!

I really like it. It's going to be cold this week so I should get to wear
it a lot. I've also got a great scarf, many pairs of socks, a hat and some
mittens from Kris. I just need knitted pants and underwear and I'm completely
swaddled in wool!
