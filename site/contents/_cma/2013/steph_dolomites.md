The Dolomites - Three fun climbs with Steph
---

TLDR; Me and Steph Abegg climb the Comici on the Salamiturm (5.9, 14 pitches), the South Face Dimai/Eoetvoes on Tofana (5.6, 20 pitches) and the "Mariakante" on Piz Pordoi (5.6, 10 pitches) in three good days.

---

Here are the things Steph can't do:

She can't drive a stick shift, a real bummer in Europe, where the prejudice
against automatic transmission is sneering and palpable. She can't bring herself
to eat a meal in a restaurant, since the prices are scandalous. In Italy, where
things are done a certain way, I had some real awkward moments ordering food
while the woman with me skulked away outside to heat *her* meal up herself. Oh
man, I got some withering looks! Finally, and most damningly, she can't be
counted on to press the snooze button for one or two extra "z"s in the pitch
dark before dawn. She'll just chirp Reaganesque platitudes: _"Welp, at least
it'll be cool for the hike in!"_ or _"Yep, we'll beat the crowds!"_

But despite all that, she is kind of a superstar. So I dithered about for weeks,
bugging my wife and kids about what routes I should climb with this visiting
dignitary of the Northwest. Too common, too obscure, too crowded, trying too
hard? Non-committal responses. Sigh. Route and peak obsession seems to begin and
end with me around here. In truth, obsession has been harder to come by than it
used to be. So happily I remember those rainy November nights, curled up with
the *Green Bible* and some string cheese,
thinking about the Napeequa or the dripping slabs of Darrington. I'd get to meet
Steph and visit a previous version of myself too. 

The kind of kid you want to have, Steph had just finished hiking the Haute Route
with her parents, a 10 day trip from Chamonix to Zermatt. She arrived in Munich,
and we set off for Groednertal, the valley below the Langkofel and the Sella
Towers. I'd picked the route on the cover of my guidebook to the area, which was
the Comici Route on the Salamiturm, roughly 5.9 and 14 pitches.

_Our route is along the line of shade and light on the yellow tower in the
center._

We hiked to the base of a long gully to find a couple guys worried about hard
snow. *Let us Nor'westerners lead the way!*

Picking up sharp rocks to carve steps, we bashed up in our tennis shoes with the
others following. Then a long rocky scramble in slabs and gullies
followed. Suddenly, the locals were everywhere, descending on the start of the
route from odd directions. There are other gullies? I'd just been lecturing
Steph on how truly uncrowded the place is, but mid-lecture I had to alter things
by allowing that it's Saturday, and I guess this route is probably a major
classic or something. We were third in line, and once we dealt with some awkward
traversing on the first pitch we kept our place with dignity among the locals.

_A small crowd, aggressive to start._

A protectionless 5.7 traverse followed, only
because I overlooked all the pitons. Steph followed the route most of the day,
which also meant she carried the heavier pack. I looked around, smiling
queasily. Whats up with a big-boned man like me essentially carrying a
fanny-pack while this wisp of a girl lost in her down jacket carries all the
gear? Heh. But I was way too scared to shoulder my load, now there was a 5.8
overhanging crack. Aw, fun!

_At a belay._

A few more pitches led to the crux, a long vertical pitch
leading to an overhang. We could see a couple guys atop the overhang, their
ropes hanging casually down into space. Steph took pictures of everything,
cataloguing the whole thing in a unique way. Only later as I scrolled through
pictures would I notice how many textbook flower photos she managed to take on
these "forbidding" walls. I never noticed the flowers at all, but apparently I'm
romping through a botanists wonderland.

_If I can't sling it, I can't see it :p._

Somehow
her down-jacketed appearance was comforting, so I broke the crux pitch up into
two sections to reduce my own mewling. The overhang was nice, kind of like the
crux on Sleese with the traverse by the piton, only it was longer and there were
more pitons. I chortled at the aid slings people had attached in the roof then
nearly handed my ass to myself in a slippery frankenstein lieback. Whew, that
was close. Steph found the crux underwhelming, thus ruining my evening plans to
constantly re-enact the sweaty final moves.

_The view from here._

Another steep crack, then a zone of awkward traversing,
followed by a pitch of "cottage cheese" rock, acceptable only because it paved
the way to easier ground. Finally we came into the sun and Steph could put her
huge jacket away. Steph led the last pitches to the summit, gradually getting
used to the rock. The thing is, the Dolomites are not difficult at all, it's
just that you can't protect all that often, and the rock is steeper than what
you expect for "easy" ground.

It was gorgeous on top, we were on one
tower of dozens, some higher, some lower.

_Steph is taking a picture at this exact moment to sync the timing of our
cameras._

Steph led some alpine rappels with weird traversing and
bad anchors to a notch, then we scrambled and skied down two thousand feet of
scree to reach the hut in the cirque of the Langkofel towers.

_Finally on a trail._

_Whee! Take that, shoes._

Steph will indulge in one thing, and that's coffee. But she never figured out
the difference between an Americano, a regular coffee, a cappuccino and a
Milchkaffee. We had a bunch of theories about it, involving number of "shots"
and other things, but gee, it was hard, and thinking isn't what *I* like to do
on vacation. All the people around here order combination drinks anyway. Like,
never order a Coke, but a _Spetzi_, it's half-half Fanta and Coke. Never order a
beer, get a _Radler_ (part beer part limonade i shit you not it's delicious). I
think I had a _Radler_ which allowed me to kind of float down on the combination
beer and sugar high.

_Drinks are helpful._

_The hut warden brought us this book to sign._

We got back to the car to find a 41
euro ticket for parking in the wrong place, just when I'd been explaining how
great it is that we don't have "pay to play" around here like the corporate
fueled US of A. Just keep that in mind. We expat-types love to talk up where we
live, and hell we do love it. But there is bullshit over here too. However the
healthcare system rocks. (runs away).

We drove to the Falzarego Pass above Cortina, me making Steph just a little
carsick with the 7000 180-degree switchbacks. After a picnic dinner (greasy
pizza for me, healthy sandwiches for Steph), we geared up to climb the 20 pitch
South Face of Tofana di Rozes, the peak that dominates the skyline above the
Cinque Torre cragging area.

_The route, long, easy, but requires routefinding savvy._


I'd been on the route
before under less than ideal conditions and was happy to come back. Hilariously,
in the morning below the base, I couldn't remember which gully to take. The face
dissolved into 4 or 5 different candidates. Steph found it, a vaguely obscene
traverse above a really frightening moat that I briefly tried to climb
directly. You know that thing where you are on snow, and are contemplating a
step across to slabs with wet shoes, and the edge of the snow harrows down into
darkness? Yeah, I hate that.


{% image http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5459/9550764922_e698eee635.jpg %}

_In case you climb it, just remember the baby._

So the traverse avoided the moat, AND, as
a bonus, Steph found 2 shirts and a locking carabiner! She didn't have room for
these items in her pack, so she attached them all on the outside in a kind of
window-display style.

_The Alpine Peddler._

We wouldn't see anyone else on this route. Steph led all
the way up the lower buttress into the Great Amphitheater. We got some water and
she kept going up to and beyond the traverse into the Second Amphitheater. This
is a strange, atmospheric place. When I was here before, there was a rope
hanging down from the overhanging walls, which was somehow frightening. That was
gone now, but you got the impression of flakes creakily attached, a sort of
pregnant pause before the deluge.

_Escaping to the chimneys._

Steph led out on what I thought of as a crux pitch,
traversing right into a wall, then back left on an overhanging flake. But she
was like, no way, too dangerous. She came back and espied the "direct
variation," which I'd forgotten about, a pitch of grade V+ (5.8) climbing a
crack that avoids the loose-flake traverse. She did the first half, then felt
weird, and I tried it. A couple of committing moves on decent cams allowed me to
pull the lip and find some jugs. We were happy to be done with this strange
area!

A steep chimney and some easier ground led to the stellar traverse
pitches, way above the valley floor and completely exposed. The traverse is easy
and well protected, but it's still fantastic. We signed a little route book
hidden in a cave, then made our way to the exit pitches. Steph led the final
pitch, a 5.6 devious face and chimney where you climb behind a big chockstone,
then get above it with stemming. Oh yeah, time for tennis shoes! Actually, Steph
switched to her approach shoes halfway up the route but I was way too scared to
do that. Now we scrambled up a ridge for almost an hour, doing a few climbing
moves halfway, and eventually scree-plodding to the summit, marked by a huge
cross.

_Okay, your lead, Steph. <whistling>_

On the hike down it started to rain. Then
to rain really hard. Then the hail started, and oh man it got bad! We had
everything on and plodded down miserably, descending little ledges that were now
streaming with water and ice chunks. We saw boulders rolling down in
torrents. My helmet protected my head from the sharp pellets of ice, but
sometimes I'd get one right in the ear which made me shriek like Flanders. At
least we weren't alone, there were about a dozen other miserable people
somewhere in the area, having climbed up different ways. Finally, when every
pocket and gully was full of graupel it stopped. 30 minutes later it was like
nothing had happened at all. We couldn't stop remarking on what it would have
been like to be in the route with a storm like that. Half of the route would
have become a waterfall. On the positive side, there were a fare number of
cave-like overhangs, and we would have probably muddled our way through to one
of those.

_Ow, my frickin' ears!_


{% image http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2815/9550846974_f64c6618c2.jpg %}

_Everything is fine *now*._


{% image http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2833/9548071511_cd2fdef505.jpg %}

_Old people are happy inside buildings._


I felt like a really old guy back at the car,
stiff, sore, sunburned. I had to have some hot food, but Steph was happy to
munch on leftovers. Pathetically, I sat inside wolfing down soup and bits of
chicken like the Steward of Gondor while she heated up some mashed potatoes on a
stove outside. Thinking about it, I'd say it's that kind of persistence and
sticking to her guns that has made Steph great at the things she does.<br><br>We
returned to a secret spot to sleep. It had a roof, which we were so happy about
because now it rained harder than I'd ever heard it rain anywhere. An angry "Old
God" with a firehouse was painting his fury on the country with short, savage
strokes. Aside from a few more mice and spiders than usual, we were undisturbed
and I slept like the dead.

For our last day we chose something easy. We'd
do the famous "Mariakante" on the Piz Pordoi, at 5.6 and 10 pitches, with the
chance to take a lift down to the car.

_The view to the Marmolada from the Mariakante._

I was pretty beat, especially when
the first pitch required me to visibly man up and pep talk myself past some
slabby, polished cruxes.

_Me tired. Me sore and weak!_

Steph got the actual crux on this route, a wet vertical step
onto sloping ledges. Higher, she got to experience the full galaxy of runout
hilarity the Dolomites can provide, by following the obvious (and
protectionless) dihedral above our belay. Apparently you should know better and
beetle off to indistinct ramps well to the side. Pleasant enough climbing
followed, but the main joy of this route is the novelty of the lift going by
full of aghast people wondering when you'll fall or "do something crazy." But
here we see why climbing will never make it as an x-treme sport. If you look at
us long enough, everything we do appears entirely reasonable. And we just move
too slowly, darn it. I'd call our game Disappointingly Rational.

_Cognitive dissonance._

After the awesome novelty of giving Steph a hip belay
braced by the steel girders of the lift station, we were ready for coffee, cake
and lift tickets. On the drive home Steph bought an ice cream sandwich with a
cartoon on it. I think she even bought another one to see if it had a new panel,
and it did.

_The cartoon-laced ice cream sandwich._

Amazingly, Steph completed a whole serious of
diagrams and route overlays on the way back to Munich, tapping away at her
computer, filling in spreadsheets with german/english climbing terms and names
of plant species discovered. All she had to do was get the Breath of Life (wifi)
at our place, and her report was uploaded. 

It was really, really neat to
host Steph over here and do some climbs with her. She made me work harder than
I'm used to…the European way got to me more than I thought it would! We were
super lucky with the weather too. Thanks Steph!

### Gear Notes

Lots of slings, medium cams, draws. We mostly used a single 50m rope.

### Approach Notes:

If it takes more than an hour you're doing it rong.
