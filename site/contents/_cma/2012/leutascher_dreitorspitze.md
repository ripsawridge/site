**March, 2012**
  
  
I skied up the Leutascher Dreitorspitze on this great-weather day. First
I struggled a bit in the forest on rough ski paths that required some tree
climbing! Later I met two nice fellas who were going to climb Mt. Rainer
in the early summer. We skied to the top and all the way down together.
The elevation gain was quite a haul (1600 meters), and the final bit was
quite exciting on the descent. A steep couloir had to be skied down and
this was great fun.
  
  
My legs were wobbling by the time we reached the car!
