Peter and I snowshoed up the Hoher Fricken. Man, it was not easy!
The snow was very warm, so we sank extremely deep. The final 300 or
so meters to the summit were punishing.

The first 3/4 of the way up were basically snow-free, which was pretty
amazing. We stopped at the little hut. All in all, it was about 4
hours to the summit, which seemed pretty good considering the
tiring work. We went down into the Frickenkar, just bombing down
the slope like I did in December (instead of following the ridge trail).

On the way home, there was some train confusion. We had to wait for a
doctor to come aboard our train...no explanation as to why. Then we
followed the herd onto another train, even though it was non-existent
according to mysterious messages from loudspeakers. Really strange.
We were both completely wasted.

Thanks for a fun day out, Peter and mountains, too!
