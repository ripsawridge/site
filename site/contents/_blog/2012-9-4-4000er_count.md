Georg and I had an \*amazing\* mountain vacation trip this year, massive
thanks to him. I bumped my 4000er count by quite a bit. Now, I'm a "Route
Man," not especially interested in tagging summits just because of their
height. But it's fun to play with lists, so here is a quick picture of
where I am right now. Note that there are about [82 4000 meter summits on the UIAA list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alpine_four-thousanders).
So will I complete the list in my lifetime? Unless I start focusing on
summits, "not likely" is probably the answer.
  
  

## The Matterhorn, 2008

May as well start with a good one! Theron and I climbed the Hörnli Ridge
in July, 2008\. We loved it. Yes it was crowded. But until I do another
route I believe it's the most asthetic route on the mountain. I know no
one else agrees with me on this, but stand in the meadows above Zermatt,
looking up at that thing and try to tell me otherwise.
  
  

## Mont Blanc, 2009

Dan and I had an amazing time on the Innominata Ridge, really proud to
start from hot Val Veni and go through a tour-de-force of rock, ice and
snow. This was a breakthrough climb for me, though Dan thought of it as
just another "snow slog." But I think he had fun too. Great trip. We also
climbed the Courmayeur summit, zombies as we were :D.
  
  

## Obergabelhorn, 2011

Man, Pete and I had an awesome trip in 2011, combining rock climbing in
the Ecrins with a couple of peaks in the Valais. We traversed the Obergabelhorn
with a bivy before the Arbengrat and descent to the Rothorn Hut down the
North Ridge. Whew...Pete is a great photographer and got some amazing pictures.
The picture shown is one I took of him when we reached the summit and realized
we'd be traversing endless corniced ridges on the descent.
  
  

## Zinalrothorn, 2011

From the same trip, now joined by Petr from Prague (yep, Pete and Petr
:D). I wouldn't have gotten out of bed at 3 am if it weren't for Petr meeting
us at the Rothorn Hut, so I owe him for that! We did the normal route up
and down, traversing ambitions set aside due to the huge climbing day before
on the Obergabelhorn.
  
  

## Weissmies, 2012
  
  
For the first time, I do a "training climb" to get used to the high altitude.
Georg and Alex had already climbed a couple of peaks and I joined for a
quick run up, assisted by a lift to somewhere around 3000 meters. Therefore,
I am embarassed, but I do count it! :D
  
  

## Aiguille Verte, 2012

Georg and I tried to ramp it up just a little bit from the Weissmies but
we bit off a big chunk. We went up by an "ingenious" combination route
of the Charlet Couloir, to the Grande Rocheuse South Buttress, to the Whymper
Couloir, and down the Moine Ridge after an (ahem) unplanned bivy. Beautiful
climbing, but the rocks on the way up were just too difficult. Lots of
grade V rock climbing (5.7-5.8) in boots, good experience, for sure!
  
  

## Gran Combin, 2012
  
  
![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7128/7875764290_4d7ab7a1cd.jpg)
  
The picture shows Georg at dawn on the Northwest Face of the Gran Combin.
We rarely settle for the easy way up a peak! This was a little funny because
we started from the south, had to climb up to a pass, drop down to the
north, get almost lost, and finally wander onto the great ice face. This
climb included another summit (the Valsorey summit of the peak).
  
  

## Mont Blanc du Tacul, 2012
  
  
![](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8447/7875878604_d46042df46.jpg)
  
Georg and I were so excited about the Diable Ridge, which features audacious
rock climbing over towers at 4000 meters. With a freezing level above the
summit of Mont Blanc, who could resist? We hit it at the right time and
made out like bandits with an unforgettable day in the mountains. Hells
yes! Oh and by climbing the Diable Ridge we got 5 more summits on the ridge.
  
  

## Alphubel, 2012
  
  
![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7270/7875924544_596253de40.jpg)
  
Georg on the summit of the Alphubel, a "no big deal" peak back in the
Valais. But for us it was the first of between 2-5 summits, depending on
how ambitious we would be on our traverse of the Dom to the south. Oddly,
we were a bit tired (Georg's pack was overloaded), and the easy ascent
was offset by the sobering and difficult descent of the North Ridge.
  
  

## Täschhorn, 2012
  
  
![](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7875940820_1caec5ab31.jpg)
  
The next day after being scared by wind and almost giving up, we went
up the South Ridge of the Täschhorn, a really pleasant rock climb.
  
  

## Dom, 2012
  
  
![](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8294/7875969986_a2e1141b7a.jpg)
  
We decided to keep going south, so from the summit of the Täschhorn we
dropped down the North Ridge (sometimes stressful) to the Domjoch and up
the South Ridge of the Dom (sometimes...stressful!). It was e-nough! Had
I been made of sterner stuff, we might have gotten 2 more summits before
the snow started.
  
  
So there I am. 13 4000ers in 2012, and 5 more over the previous 4 years.
18 down, 64 to go!!
