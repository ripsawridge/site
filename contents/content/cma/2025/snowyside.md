More details to follow, for now here are some pictures. We hiked in to a camp at Twin
Lakes, lounged away the afternoon, and climbed Snowyside Peak the next morning.
Then we hiked out by Toxaway Lake, which became exhausting in the hot afternoon.
We had thought to camp, and indeed, did stop for a few hours and set up
tents. But then we hightailed it out to the car just before dark in the cooler air.
Two great days!
