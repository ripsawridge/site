### Roßstein and Buchstein
<i>November 20, 2011</i>

Needed some exercise. Really enjoyed the scramble up the Roßstein, making sure
not to touch the metal cable. And the little scramble up to the Buchstein
summit is neat too (though I think it's harder than I+...I'd call it II at
least for the exposure). On top in an hour. On the way down, tagged the
Roßstein summit and sat a few more minutes. Also tagged the big boulder on the
way down. :D. 2.5 hours car to car.
