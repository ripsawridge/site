excerpt here:

Producer Brian Eno famously said that while only a few thousand people
bought the Velvet Underground's first album in 1967, almost all of them
went on to start a band. Significantly, Jason Roeder was born just five
years later. Crooner/prophet, proto-minimalist provocateur, Afro-Cuban
puppeteer/rickshaw operator/YMCA member -- try as we might, the usual generalities
fail us. And as this compilation demonstrates, they failed Roeder, too.

**1\. The First Eight Notes to the "Star Wars" Theme:** In December of
1979, Roeder turned 7\. And he was worried. Sid Vicious had already checked
out, and Roeder wondered if he'd make the scene before punk's inevitable
implosion. At the time, he said in his typical cryptic fashion: "What food
group does Tang go in?" But more than anything, he wanted to be a Jawa,
one of the cowled sand-dwelling gnomes with flashbulb eyes that appeared
in "Star Wars." Roeder, a natural but profoundly limited autodidact, sat
down at the upright piano his mother had once taken lessons on and began
to play. Ten months later, he finished the first cut on this CD. If you
listen carefully, you can hear "Barnaby Jones" on the television in the
background and eventually nothing but, as Roeder leaves the piano to go
watch the show and eat fish sticks.

**2\. A Piece of Wood, Sort Of:** Thousands of miles away from the burgeoning
New Wave scene, Roeder was participating in a compulsory country-western
performance organized by the bloc of 4th-grade teachers at his Florida
elementary school. The 20 or so students prejudged as most untrustworthy
with a solo instrument were provided with two sticks to knock together
when very specifically pointed at. Roeder was given one stick. In this
cut, a performance of the Oak Ridge Boys' "Elvira," Roeder is inaudible
except for a small disruption in the second chorus during which he drops
his stick.

**3\. Moonlight:** While hair metal bands conquered the charts and hip-hop
staked its own claim in popular music, Roeder spent most of the first half
of the 1980s in a haze of book reports and sleeveless surf-themed T-shirts.
His musical journey hadn't even begun, but he was at a crossroads. Though
he had already gone through three piano teachers, he was mature enough
to lay the blame not on them, but squarely where it belonged: the piano.
Shortly after picking up the guitar, Roeder was recruited by an acquaintance
in his 8th-grade English class to join the band Dublin, an emerging U2
rip-off project. In "Moonlight," written by some guy named Alan, Roeder
drives the gibberish lyrics with a relentless E-minor chord until the clamor
frays, each player bowing out to pick through Alan's Playboy stash.

**4\. Three-Legged Lover:** Nearing high school graduation, Roeder turned
to lyrics in order to expand his artistic palette. It was during this period
that he completed his only original song, "Three-Legged Lover." Best known
for its provocative chorus -- "She's got three legs and three very high
heels/ something like a tricycle, except not with wheels/ She's got two
to run and two to jump/ she puts the third aside for her dog to hump" --
the song somehow never climbed past No. 52 even on Roeder's imaginary charts.
In this track, Roeder mumbles a cappella while waiting for his mother to
pick him up from his after-school job at the movie theater. The intermittent
growling is from the lowrider circling the parking lot for no apparent
reason.

**5\. Minuteman March:** In the early '90s, grunge exploded out of Seattle
like a flannel supernova. Meanwhile, on the East Coast, Roeder was a college
freshman who had grown frustrated with the many expressive limitations
of the guitar. He had also put aside songwriting -- "Words are for people
with nothing to say," he repeatedly declared without irony -- and went
in search of an instrument with more sonic possibilities. He took up the
drums, and it only made sense: He was sharing a tiny dorm with a roommate,
had a crushing course load, and had the rhythm of a cinder block rolling
down a flight of stairs. Here, in "Minuteman March," Roeder practices elementary
snare rudiments. Curiously, he received few complaints from his neighbors,
who would later report they would've felt awful disturbing someone's physical
therapy.

**6\. to 35\. Gratuitous Remixes**

And, suddenly, Jason Roeder was gone. He came back five minutes later
because he forgot his keys, but then he was gone again, and for real. It's
been a decade. We've all heard about the dubious sightings -- the grizzled
transient who sleeps in a dryer, the pine-cone salesman, the thirtysomething
who looks exactly like Roeder, claims to be him, and has matching fingerprints
and dental records -- but these are just phantoms conjured by a generation
that needs a hero more than ever. Iconic music journalist Lester Bangs
once remarked, "Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own
time and one toward the future, toward eternity." Ten years after Jason
Roeder vanished, this much is clear: I finally managed to work Lester Bangs
into these liner notes.
