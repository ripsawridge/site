Uli and I took the lift up to the Kampenwand on Sunday. We knew it would
start raining eventually, hence the laziness! Right away, we climbed the
Staffelstein Westkante (V-), which gave 2 nice pitches and some change.
Then the route Ulknudel (VI) which had a pretty darned hard first pitch!
I had to rest a couple of times on the sustained sport climb, but I particularly
enjoyed an outrageous move at a roof where you get a foot up by your head.

Next we did the Kampenwand Traverse. First I tried taking the most adventurous
way on steep slabs, then eventually getting into a corner with a hard move
by a piton. I had to aid on the pin! Uli came up and we simul-climbed over
a summit. Later we had a nice climb of the Gmelchturm Westkante (VI-) as
a nice little part of the traverse. Well protected climb to the top of
a tiny tower. We finished the traverse with a couple more interesting pitches,
especially a crack (IV+) leading up to the main summit. It was quite interesting,
though just a bit wet.

After this we hiked down to the south and got on the SÃ¼dostwand (VI).
Uli led the first (crux) pitch, then we had an embarrassing communication
mishap that need not be recorded here! However eventually I followed the
pitch, and we went for one more pitch up a slab and across a slabby traverse.
From here, our time was up, as the storm clouds that had been gathering
were ready to burst. We made two rappels to the ground, and hiked out in
strong rain.

We visited a hut along the way for a beer, then hiked down to the car.
A nice visit to a new area for us both!
