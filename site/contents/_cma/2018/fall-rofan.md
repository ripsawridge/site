## Hochiss

Saturday I drove to the mountains, intending to hike up the Sonnjoch, but
the road from Pertisau was closed. So I made do with a hike up Hochiss in
the Rofan Mountains on the other side of the Achensee.

This was a fantastic hike!

## Hochnissl (2546 m)

I wasn't sure what to do the next day, but finally decided on a little-visited
peak called Hochnissl, on the long *Vomper Kette* ridge that travels down from
the high Lamsenspitze (2508) to the town of Stans, almost 2000 meters below.

I was able to start at about 850 meters elevation on the Vomperberg, first with
about 30 minutes walking flat along a road, then steeply by a hunters cabin
and into a relentless climb on the south side of the ridge. I'd hate to be
here in high summer! Latschen and scree forever. About 1000 meters straight up
through that. Finally a little rest break on the Niedernissl (2067 m), then
steeply up to the ridge and on the ridge for the last 400 meters. Really fantastic.
I believe I saw one guy near the summit, but on the way down, as the sun dropped
below the trees there was a guy hiking up for a night-time ascent. Wow...
pretty interesting idea in such rugged terrain!

Another great hike. Sigh. Time to go home.
