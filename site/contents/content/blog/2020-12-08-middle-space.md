Today, running errands, I put my consciousness in the middle space between my eyes and the object
I looked at. This relaxes me. It shows how unimportant I am, and how unimportant the things that
I react to are.

My reactions themselves are unimportant.

It is just a scene, like in a movie.

You neither love nor hate the characters in the frame. Stripped of excessive care or worry,
you can finally, from this middle position, observe.

And observing, needing nothing, the goodness of what is there begins to seep into your awareness.

Michael walks towards a limping man. He limps too.

Michael stares at the road ahead. His own eyes are as distant as the trees on the horizon.

Barbara is talking and being held. Michael is holding.

The pen writes, the heart glows. Michael is a smile.

The music is there. Its perception is its creation.

Will to continue is in the Mind. The feet that walk countless miles are projected into the
future and the past.

And thus they escape time.

Your face.
