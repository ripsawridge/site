### Buchstein
_September 4, 2014_

After work, I hiked up the Buchstein, intending to eat dinner there. But
something went wrong somehow. I asked the hut warden if I could order dinner and
he just ignored me. It was strange. I waited a few minutes, then left to
scramble up the peak. Oh well. Sometimes interactions with people are
strange. Anyway it was a great hike...weather was cloudy but I had fairly broad
views. Some skimming clouds wisping around me on the scrambling sections, and a
couple kids playing at the Tegernseer Hütte.
