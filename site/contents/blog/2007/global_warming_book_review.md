From the NYT Review of Books, several reviews about global warming:
  
  
  
Consider the fact that the average Western European uses half as much
energy as the average American (and hence produces half as much CO2). Half
is a big proportion, especially when you consider that it comes not from
any new technology but instead from somewhat different social arrangements.
Europeans have decided to, say, invest in building cities that draw people
in instead of flinging them out to sprawling suburbs, and invest in mass
transit that people then actually take. This kind of investment may produce
quicker returns than high-tech R&D; at the very least, it's urgently important
that these kinds of societies (where reported rates of human satisfaction
are sharply higher than in the US) be held up to China, India, and the
rest of the developing world, in place of our careening model. In addition,
given that we will certainly be facing a disrupted planet, tighter human
communities are probably a better bet for "surviving and thriving" than
bioengineering to achieve different kinds of bodies.
