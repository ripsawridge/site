### Skiing in Kühtai and Sölden
_January 6-7, 2007_

Daniel and I tried a ski tour above Haggen in the Sellrain, but a lack of snow,
or "WHUMP!"-ing scary snow when there was some made us lose interest. We turned
around after a couple of hours slogging up the valley.

We were soothed by groomed slopes of <a
href="https://www.bergfex.com/kuehtai/">Kühtai</a> up the road. Ah, how nice!
We went all over until we could hardly stand. We spent the night at an
inexpensive guest house near there.

The next day we went to <a href="https://www.bergfex.com/soelden/">Sölden</a>,
and oogled the incredible peaks around us. The Wildspitze looked especially
regal. We strung together all 4 big sections that make up this large ski area
during the day, giving a "thumbs down" to one of them because of too many
pebbles in the snow. But the two regions on glaciers were amazing. It was
really wierd to ski and see big ice walls on the side of you! Again and again
we lifted up 1000 meters then skied down, then up, etc. Really fun, great
skiing trip and many thanks to Daniel.
