Talking with a friend yesterday about the job of ensuring corporate
compliance.  Making sure the company does proper sign offs. That procedures
are in place to make good, legal decisions. My friend was very enthusiastic
about it, despite (because of?) long experience. Really cool.

She continually faces the problem that people are happy to work in their roles
with only partial understanding. They really don't mind that they don't know
the criteria for sign-offs, or the complete list of their responsibilities in a
given situation. They'll clutch hold of a few procedures while ignoring others,
and those few that they do, they do incorrectly. Or, often, the procedures they
do carry out only make sense within a context of other related procedures also
occurring. Since the others don't occur, meaningless work is done.

And meaningless work is dangerous, because it lulls the individuals involved
into thinking that they are "doing something," when they aren't. Now they don't
even know that they don't know. Tragically, the activity camouflages a lack of
meaningful activity.

I find this very interesting, both in my role as a manager of engineers working
on highly technical projects, and as an amateur occultist. I've said something
alarming, I know. Let me define a term and move
on. This is what I mean by occultism:

> It means the world itself is your teacher and your playground. It means nothing
> should be ignored, nor should anything be seized on as a single cause. Reality
> is highly complex, even when considered from a purely materialistic point of
> view. An occultist admits the possibility of more modes of being than can be
> perceived with current science. As you can imagine, this increases complexity
> by orders of magnitude! Therefore, no one should be more interested in
> practical ways to proceed with intellect intact than the occultist. If a
> reasoning man or woman may well go astray amid competing "facts" and
> predilections,  so much greater might be the error of one who purports to add
> new modes of perception to the input field.

I'll return to this branch, but let's consider the more practical
ramifications. I work with a team of amazing and inspiring engineers. They are
pretty self aware, and very detail oriented, so I don't see them getting into
deep error through cycles of meaningless work. If the people of my profession
court meaninglessness, it runs at a higher level. That is, all our activities
may mutually interlock and support each other, in a continually validated and
maintained structure. However, the building in which those activities occur, so
to speak, may be condemned. Our most difficult moments are in the twilight
hours, when we ask "yes, but does it mean anything on the grand scale? And why
shouldn't I use the grand scale to measure my effort?"

So, I think I feel pretty good about our team. I'm sure my friend would quiz us
and find many things we do without thinking! But I do think we'll pass any
test.

*Inside the man is another man, scared and deeply out of compliance.*

ON the more personal level, then. I'd argue that any kind of spiritual practice
is in continual danger of "doing meaningless work." When people use the term
dogma, this is what they are talking about -- a set of activities that are done
by rote, and even the people who teach you to do them never incorporated their
meaning. Religions are full of these things. Unfortunately, they don't have
real compliance officers. They seem to just have people who hector and demand
that the future look exactly like the past. However, taking my friends use of the term, it means someone
who not only ensures proper procedure, but the *why* of the procedure, *and the
why not*, if it is no longer effective.

This is precisely what we all need to cultivate in ourselves. A keen
discernment that separates the useful from the outmoded. A going over of the
processes that you've chosen to ensure they remain meaningful and effective.
You are continually changing, and the beliefs you held yesterday have already
begun morphing into what looks on the surface to be their opposite. You and
your environment co-evolve, and dozens of unnamed emotional states ripple
through you in a day or a night. Your compliance officer must stalk the halls.

I believe this is meditation. Meditation is the space for the office, and the
work itself. It is the question "Why?" encoded at a deeper level than words,
where it penetrates your being, and finally offers some chance of bringing
forth the answer.

Support your compliance officer! Sit at attention, and let her stalk you. You
will not only emerge unharmed. You may even transform into the dream of you.
