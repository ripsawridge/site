### Rossstein and Buchstein
_April 4, 2014_

Hiked up Rossstein and Buchstein in heavy rain. I loved my trusty umbrella. The rain let up when I
had to use my hands for the scrambling, but the rocks were quite slick. The Tegernseehuette is
closed. Up and down in 2:45, 900 meters gain/loss.

### Wallberg
_March 23, 2014_

Riki and I hiked up Wallberg in a hilarious driving snow-storm. We were thinking those days are over
in this short and strange winter. Lots of trailbreaking on the road when it comes out of the forest.
The summit was a cloudy experience. Good times!

### 2 days with Timo

Timo and I skied up the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel in the Sellrein. Fun day! We broke trail for the first two-thirds
of the route, then stronger people came! Beautiful deep powder. We stayed in Gries that evening with a nice old
fellow. The next day we climbed the Bafflfall, good fun, then went to the Martinswand to climb the via ferrata.
I got freaked out with my slippery gloves, and ended up on a hiking adventure in the forest on the left side of
the Martinswand, following game trails up cliffs and steep forest. By the time I got back, Timo was waiting at
his van, like, "what happened to you?" Oh well, it all worked out on this nice day.

### Hochblassen and Ochsenaelpelekopf
<i>Feb. 2, 2014</i>

A great snowshoe hike today up Hochblassen, and then to the Ochsenaelpelekopf on
the other side of the valley. I ate lunch by the Jaeger Huette, watching the
snow come down pretty hard. It was a day of clouds and snow on and off. No views
from either summit. Fun anyway. 1400 meters up/down from the Ammerwald Hotel.

### Friederspitze
<i>January 18, 2014</i>

Snowshoe hike up Friderspitze. 1250 meters up/down.

### Forgot the name
<i>January, 2014</i>

Ski up a peak in the Sellrain with Josef, unfortunately ran out of time (and shape!), so didn't make the summit. About 1000 meters up/down.
