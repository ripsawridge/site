### Naunspitze

_April 28, 2019_

I hiked up via the Oberndorfer Weg that Barbara and I used a month ago. There was less snow overall, but
fresh snow above the hut, and pretty much continuous snow with good track from the hut to the summit.
The weather cleared pretty nicely right around 12:30 when I stood on top (took about 2 hours), then
it started snowing again while I ate Spinatknödel in the Vorderkaiserfeldenhütte. I hurried down
awkwardly, very much needing to replace my tennis shoes as the tread was too worn away! About 1150
meters up and down.

### Langfenn

_April 22, 2019_

From the Burgerhof again, I jogged and walked up to Flaas by the steepest way, then to the Schermoossattel
(1450 m). Jogging up the hill to Langfenn, I couldn't resist climbing a few meters up the stony tower.
It seemed possible to reach the summit of the tower if I could be given a top-rope for safety!
From here I descended to the now-familiar Tomagen Restauarant, then a bit further south after
a piece of cake to a ridiculously steep trail down through the forest leading to the road cut
from Jenesien to Afing. An indication of a bridge and trail on the map proved to be illusory, so I
had to settle for following the long road up directly along the Afinger Bach to the retaining pond
below the Burgerhof, then tiredly up to the Hof itself. About 1000 meters up and down.

### Stoanerne Mandl

_April 20, 2019_

From the Burgerhof, I jogged up the road on the east side of the Afinger-bach. Eventually it reached a
steep v-cut in the valley and turned back on the west side of the river to continue up to
Kampidell in additional switchbacks, but I followed instead a logging spur into the notch.
Naturally enough, it ended, leaving me stranded at about 1340 meters. I decided to risk climbing
straight up-slope to about 1600 meters where a road could get me to a little restaurant.
Despite some steep hand-over-hand work, this worked, and I soon stood at the still-closed little
restaurant, my dreams of a cappucino dashed. Here, for the first time I saw the sun, which was
welcome on my frozen arms. I had neither jacket nor backpack. Now I followed a snowy forest trail
to the Möltner Kaser, and sat down in the sun, warming my arms and hoping that the restuarant would
open soon. Sure enough, a man came bouncing up in a truck over humps of snow. Clutching sausages in
his hand, he bore the unwelcome news that the Kaser wouldn't be open until Monday. Alas!

So I headed due north on snow for the summit of the Stoanerne Mandl (2003 m). I was lucky that the snow was still
frozen hard. The view of the Texel Range was beautiful and brought back beautiful memories. What a
fantastic summit!

Descending, I stayed on the gorgeous ridge, making my way through krokus flowers pushing up through the
snow to the Möltner Joch (1733 m). From this gorgeous overlook I descended in welcome sun to Flaas.
A short detour for a Radler at a restaurant on the road down to Afing, then back to the Burgerhof.
1170 meters up and down - a fine morning!

### Kranzhorn

_April 14, 2019_

Quick hike up Kranzhorn. I found a neat variation near the end, following a steep ridge to cliffs below the
summit. Hurried down, now my legs are sore!

### Vorderkaiserfeldenhütte ###

_April 6, 2019_

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up the steep Oberndorfer Weg to the hut for a drink. It was about 1100 meters
from the Inn valley floor. Really interesting trail...had to carry Mara at one point up some steep
Klettersteig stairs.

### Kranzhorn ###

_March 23, 2019_

Barbara and I (along with little Mara) hiked up from the Inn. A bit of snow near the top was
fun. Here is a fun video of Barbara hiking [in the snow](https://photos.app.goo.gl/j2Z9tnY3VTvFisYN7).

### Wallberg

_January 27, 2019_

A snowshow hike up the old ski way on Wallberg. With somewhat elevated
avalanche danger I decided to go whole hog and take my transceiver,
shovel and pole. Very nice ascent...I had a distinct advantage over the
few skiers out on the very steep section in the lower third of the hike.
Never saw those cats again!

A few pics...
