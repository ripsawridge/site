<h1>Dragontail Peak</h1>
<h2>Triple Couloirs</h2>
<h3>April 5-6, 2003</h3>


Aidan, Chris K., Steve and myself drove to Leaventown for a worthy goal -
The Classic Triple Couloirs!! Long had we sat enraptured at the feet of our
betters, listening to their tales of adventure on this fabled climb. Now we
would test our mettle on the not-so-lonely mountain. We parked next to a friend's
car at the Bridge Creek Campground, girding ourselves for the long (4 miles?) walk to the
trailhead.


Aidan was on skis, and the rest of us carried snowshoes uselessly all the way to the
river below the lake. I ditched mine boldly, secretly hoping that no one else
would (just in case). But 6 snowshoes soon nestled quietly together with a rather
smug pair of skis who knew they would at least be useful on 3 miles of downhill road.


We told a lot of jokes and stuff, but the best was shortly before the lake, when
Chris started scream-singing a racy ode to Dragontail. I can't repeat
it here, but it was rather bracing. It combined his stark eastern-european sensibilities
with earthy hip-hop stylings.


We got our view of the mountain at the lake. "Whoa, that was close," I said as I turned
around and hiked away. 


We set up our tent next to Colin's. He was boiling water and muttering about peanut butter
and jelly, and the appropriate time to ingest it. He told some awful jokes, but everything
is funny when you are chilled and far from home. We slowly settled in for the night, carrying
out our snow camping chores like old timers. I really admired Colin's tent. It's a single
wall tent, and as I fell asleep I imagined boiling my last packet of ramen in it, some Alaskan
storm whinging away outside.


It snowed about two inches during the night, pretty heavily until about 1 am. We left the
tent at 6:30 am, all very excited to be starting the climb.



I kicked steps up to the cone below the hidden couloir, then we hugged the left
rock wall as we traversed into the couloir proper. This was an exciting way to 
start the climb, because we were crossing a narrow band of snow above a cliff. 
Once above that, we put Chris in the lead to kick steps for a while. The snow 
was fairly deep, but compacted well. Time passed, and we climbed happily, eager 
to see around a bend in the imposing walls that hemmed us in. We reached what 
we decided were the access gullies to reach the second couloir. We stomped out a 
platform to belay from and got the ropes out. Chris wore his enormous down 
jacket as he geared up to climb a pitch up the ice gully. He and Steve would 
climb on a rope, and Aidan and I would climb just behind. Without a down 
jacket I was eager to keep moving, so the long belay ledge sessions tended to 
bring out the worst in me (which is my singing for warmth). In a quavering, 
tremelous voice I sang "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/metallica/13759.htm">
The Thing That Should Not Be</a>," one of my favorite songs 
of all time. 


Chris found a belay from pitons, and Steve started up with me on his heels.
I tried to hang back and focus on the fun climbing. We climbed 
a shallow gully with frozen snow and ice of 60 degrees. The axe placements were 
solid and easy to make. While Steve and Chris fussed with a piton belay, I 
brought Aidan up from ice screws. The sun was beginning to poke holes in the 
thick, gray clouds over the lake. I took a picture of Aidan in the gully, and 
sipped the rich wine of exposure and commitment. For some reason, I always 
relax when the climbing really begins. The long hike in, the melting of snow to 
drink, the restless sleep each harbor vague obstacles that I'm sure will 
derail our train to real climbing. Now I could forget about that.


Aidan noticed some rap slings as he climbed by. He always finds or remembers 
things others overlook. As Chris started up, Aidan chopped a ledge that I 
could put my right foot on. Pitch two was more challenging, going around a 
short cliff on thin ice over dark rock slabs. Chris didn't find any pro near 
there, but climbed confidently on the dicey terrain.



While the three of us waited, Colin appeared in the couloir below. Soon he 
climbed part-way up to us and chatted for a few minutes. Aidan was especially 
happy to see his cousin. After a few traded insults, Colin decided to try a way 
to the right of our line up a narrow ice gully. We watched him climb away, 
really impressed by his skill.


Chris had been climbing a long time, and though the views of the lake and 
valley below were enchanting, I began to get impatient. Rather than another 
bout of singing, I decided to climb away carefully. I believed that whatever 
trouble Chris was having, I could avoid it somehow by belaying earlier. 
Very soon, the climbing became awkward and hard, as it took all my concentration 
to deal with the thin tool 
placements that would shatter if I applied too much pressure. I
traversed more thin ice up and right, where I placed a picket and an ice screw.
I was able to see Chris, and noticed that he was still 
climbing. I told Steve, who said "I don't like to hear that!"
He was muscling his way up the ice step, concentrating hard. 
All of us would like a belay on the thin 
ice section, so I resolved to somehow find one. By the 
scraped away snow on a rock outcrop, I saw where Chris had searched in vain for a 
piton placement. I climbed a little higher past another ice step to snow, and 
made a decent picket and axe belay. Steve continued past to a water ice step.


I belayed Aidan from this even wilder position on the face. He found the pitch 
to be really exciting, even nervewracking. We definitely felt the seriousness of the climb 
in this area. Chunks of snow and ice fell on us now and then, and it started to 
snow lightly. The next pitch provided the "heart" of 
the ice climbing on the face that day. To save time, Steve left an ice screw at 
the base of the V-shaped gully. I clipped it and started up, enjoying the 
steepening ice and the views beneath my feet. Fifteen feet above the screw I 
placed another one to protect a bulge with two possible exits. I was glad I 
did, because the ice became thinner and steeper. I started left on thin ice 
over rock, then reached high for a tool placement only to find loose powder 
snow. Easing rightward, I bashed at marginal ice for something that would 
stick. My focus narrowed intensely and I kept working at it, making upward 
moves once I found solid placements for my tools. I marvelled at the 
difficulty -- it felt harder than 
anything I'd climbed before (a gaggle of WI3 pitches). Carefully topping out, I 
moved away from the void on increasingly deep snow that marked the entrance to 
the second couloir. I placed a picket, then saw Steve and Chris 100 feet above 
at a rock belay on the right edge of the couloir. I had promised Aidan a belay 
on the pitch, so I stopped after another 50 feet to build a picket and axe 
belay in the growing snowstorm.



Shades of gray and white surrounded us. Steve led off above Chris, kicking steps in the 
couloir that were quickly filled with snow. The next hour provided an 
exhausting spindrift tutorial. As I belayed Aidan, insistent streams of powder 
snow made channels in the gully around me. This couloir "drains" large areas of 
rock which shed their fresh snow eagerly in a thousand complex paths. Twenty 
feet above, Chris endured a comedy of errors when one of these paths opened and 
began covering him in clouds of snow while he struggled to remove pitons. I had 
to laugh because the rock on either side of him was free of this problem. 
Meanwhile Aidan appeared, shouting that he'd nearly drowned twice in great 
releases of drift that almost knocked him off the ice. I really wanted to get moving
at that point! Aidan climbed quickly past me to Chris, and I coiled half the rope 
over my shoulder. I had to keep re-creating my ledge in the snow as the rivers of 
spindrift turned into a general rout. Finally I could climb!


In my lonely world, my only companion was Aidan who occasionally glanced 
down sympathetically. I had aquired the prejudice that my struggles were harder 
than everyone else's. Later I found out that even though Aidan was right behind
Chris, the steps still disappeared for him in the churning
mass of drift. Deep snow
always makes me want to be somewhere else, like maybe vomiting into a dumpster
behind a Jack in the Box in suburban Tucson. 


Finally we got above the worst of the funnels, and chopped out a ledge so Steve
could belay Chris on a pitch up to the Third Couloir. It stopped snowing, and
we drank some water and talked for a while. Soon Chris and Steve were gone, and
Aidan began leading this pitch which climbed pleasantly up a shallow slot of ice
and snow. Aidan brought me up to a fantastic location beside a tower that marked
the start of the Third Couloir. I was flabbergasted by the view, having grown
institutionalized by the narrow confines of the lower and middle face. We 
shortened the ropes, and placed snow pickets as we climbed. Steve and I climbed 
together for a while. Clouds and sun chased each other on the lake below, and 
a "Tower of Adamant" stretched for the sky.


Aidan was feeling really strong, so he came to kick steps the rest of the way.
Before I knew it, 
he was practically pulling me up on the rope. We reached the ridgetop, and got 
amazing views of the Enchantments. It felt good to crawl out of the north face 
and get some sun. After Steve and Chris arrived, Aidan led us to the summit
about 10 minutes away, where we all kissed the summit rock with great passion.
It was 5:30 pm, so we spend 11 hours on the climb.
I could see Pandora's Box a quarter mile away, where Chris and I stopped on a
previous trip. Chris discovered he had a broken crampon point.


In fact, since he is moving away, all of his gear is chosing this moment to fall to
pieces. His ski pole had become a gnarled stick, without even a basket at the end or
a hand strap. 


We hiked down snowfields and made a long traverse to reach Aasgard Pass. The evening
light on Colchuck Balanced Rock was beautiful. Variable icy or soft snow made the hike
down to the lake take a while. Chris had dropped sunglasses on the climb, so he
went the base to look for them, while Aidan went ahead and began taking down the tent.
While I packed, he then melted snow for some warm drinks. It took about an hour to
get camp packed up, and the sun set as we hiked across the frozen lake. Just seven
miles to go through the snowy forest now!



After a river crossing, we split into two groups, with Aidan and Chris zooming ahead
while Steve and I hiked more slowly. We felt pretty good on the trail, but fell to
cursing on the snow-covered road walk. Once you develop a good rythym of walking a
step in the snow collapses, sending you flying forward with a big pack. You have to
laugh at the ridiculous situation!


As the agony of boredom and fatigue grew unbearable, we sped our pace considerably,
walking the last mile in a fury of limbs. We waited for 10 minutes for Chris and Aidan
to return with Steve's car, as they had gone to make a phone call. Aidan hoped
that "der Safeweg" would be open, but it wasn't. We managed to extract a few "Safeway
Select" drinks from the vending machine outside, as we were desperate, and even the
76 station was closed. Everyone thought about what he would eat when we reached
civilization, but we were also tired enough that elaborate preperations (like
toasting bread) would have sent us shuffling off to sleep. Mark and Nancy allowed
Aidan to stay at my house that night and get to school late. That allowed Steve to
stay until morning too. We lucked out and found a 24 hour Jack in the Box, where everyone
but Chris indulged in wonderful junk food.
