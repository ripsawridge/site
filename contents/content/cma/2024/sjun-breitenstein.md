Our little trio parked at the Oberes Jenbachtal. Barbara was really fast
today and by the time we reached the Aiblinger Hütte, I had to admit I
was tired! She was leading Sammy, too. She admitted as we made the final
climb to the Breitenstein that it was easier with him because he pulls you
up. That's right! Ha!

We stopped at the Hubertushütte on the way down and had a nice chat with
a couple that had a very peaceful older dog that Sammy investigated on
the summit by suddenly pulling Barbara towards them.

And Barbara led Sammy all the way down, too. Or wait, I think she went
without poles and I led Sammy. Was very interesting, a new experience
for her.

Good times, only 750 meters up/down.
