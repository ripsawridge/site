Kris and I ran errands on Saturday, and the beautiful clear
skies and sun beckoned. I was a good boy though, and actually
enjoyed doing chores around the house like finally cleaning
the garage. It was nice to see our new house in the sun.
(*We bought it in November, and as some of you around here
know, there weren't many dry, sunny days!*).


For a long time, I had wanted to get back to this climb. I
was introduced to it last June by Alex Krawarik, and was eager
to get back and lead it. I had tried several times, but rain
or a lack of partners prevented any action until now. Expecting
an answering machine, I called John Bennett, 
and he picked up!
"Sure! Sounds fun," he said. As night fell, I crossed my fingers
for good weather the next morning.


John arrived at 8, and we talked about hikes we had done and
mountains we wanted to climb all the way there. The last in a
series of fun topics was debating whether to buy camming devices
of one brand or to mix and match. Being a cheapskate, unwilling
to buy a full set of anything, I took the mix and match side.


One other party was at the base, but they climbed something else,
so we were basically alone. The hardest part of the route today
was the "3rd class" 10 foot climb to the base. Despite the
presence of an old 3-rung ladder, this step can be very taxing.
For John, the whole "multipitch climb" thing was a new experience,
and the approach was very sobering. Luckily, I knew it got better.


I led the first pitch quickly, placing minimal gear on this 5.0
gully section. The rock was cold but dry. I had to wrap a sling
around a chock-stone which doubled as a mouse latrine. This 
first pitch is actually a great first lead on gear. In
the lower 20 feet, you can actually make lots of cam and nut
placements for practice.


John came up, and gave me a few more cams, a nice small alien and
a #3 Camelot. I used both, in addition to the rest of my gear.
I had brought a double set of nuts in small-medium sizes, 1 red
tri-cam, and 3 Metolius cams. This pitch is the highlight of the
route. Rated at 5.6, the exposure is very satisfying, and the
climbing sustained and fun. The crux is right after the belay,
making use of an off-width crack to surmount a steep slab.
After a little uncertainty, I passed this and came to the double
hand/foot cracks, which continued up and across the slab in two
parallel lines. These cracks took gear well, and the increasing
exposure persuaded me to place it liberally. The sun came out
and I was really beginning to have fun.


I clipped in to 4 sturdy bolts and pulled up the rap line tied to
the back of my harness. John was ready to go, and I belayed him
up. I think he should write about his experience. It was his first
route on gear, and I know he was a little stressed. I remembered
how I felt the first time last June. I haven't improved much as
a climber since then, but I felt like the climb was much easier.
I concluded that it boils down to a fear of the unknown. John had
no idea what I was belaying on...perhaps he assumed a few
shaky pieces of tin quivering between loose boulders!


Only a little overwhelmed, John clipped to the security of the anchors,
and I finished the climb, going up around a small tree to a frictiony
slab, and the final tree belay. Very sad to see it end, I watched
snowy Mt. Index across the road and belayed. John came up and we
talked excitedly about the experience. Knowing that we would be
able to get safely down from our sturdy tree anchor, he was now having tons of fun.


I threw the ropes for the double rappel to the end of the first
pitch. Of course, they got tangled, and went the wrong way. It took
several attempts halfway down the rock to finally get them running
the right way. John's rap was faster, since that tedious task was
taken care of. We rapped down to the base, below the approach
and coiled the ropes just as it started to snow. The
early bird got the worm in this case...before it got icy and
wet!


People had started arriving and were milling about the parking lot.
It was 12:30 pm, and we drove home, happy for the chance to enjoy
the good weather, and advance our skills just a little bit!
