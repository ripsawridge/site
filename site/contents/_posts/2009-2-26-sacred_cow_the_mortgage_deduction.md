In Germany we don't get to deduct interest on a mortgage from taxes. It
does make it a bit less attractive to buy a home. [This article](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/killing-or-maiming-a-sacred-cow-home-mortgage-deductions/) exposes
an interesting debate on how that deduction might distort housing cost
and even land use:

> **Problem \#1:** Subsidizing interest payments encourages people to leverage
> themselves to the hilt to bet on housing markets. The size of the tax benefit
> is proportional to your debt. The deduction essentially encourages us to
> make leveraged bets on the swings of the housing market. That leverage
> means that housing price swings can easily wipe people out. We are currently
> experiencing the consequences of subsidizing gambles on housing.

> **Problem \#2:** The deduction pushes up prices in places where the supply
