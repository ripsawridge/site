Today was St. Martin's Day. Kids all over Germany make paper lanterns
and go out in the night. At our Kindergarten they re-enacted the story
of St. Martin. A poor, sick man was by the side of the road, very cold.
St. Martin was a knight on a powerful horse, with armor and a beautiful
red cape. The man asked him for help. In response, he tore his cape in
half, and gave half to the sick man. That is the story of St. Martin.
  
  
I played guitar and sang with the kids in the morning, and so I didn't
go in the evening. Only after seeing the pictures and hearing about the
little play they put on did I realize I made a big mistake! I'm sad to
have missed it. But Kris has pictures [here](http://mountainwerks.smugmug.com/gallery/6528801_n4Jti#415076294_JqBNm).
