Silas Wild was in town! We caught up with him for some climbing at Bad Heilbrunn, a really
neat crag. We were a large group: me, my boys, Silas and Barbara. We climbed quite a
few routes (4?) and ran into Timo and his family which was really neat!

Tragedy though, in that we left Barbara's rope somewhere...we just can't find it and now
it's gone :(. If you see a rope in a rope bag with a little dog keychain on it, let us
know!

Then we hiked up the Blomberg to the hut for a slice of cake and some beer. Barbara had
a coffee and looked lovely lying in the sun feeling good.
