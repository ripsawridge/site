We left home at 9, and I hoped this trail was tree-covered for much of the way.
It was! We enjoyed the top and I got some cake which Barbara pretended to eat
but she is very disciplined and didn't take a single bite.

She amazes me and her value is beyond price.

On the way down we missed a turn, but that was okay because we explored a
little-visited area of the forest that reminded me of the CDT in Montana.
