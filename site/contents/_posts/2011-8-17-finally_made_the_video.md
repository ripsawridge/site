It took a few days, but with the able help of Kwansei we made this video
of me playing the Incantations Part 3 solo. I overlayed the video with
snippets of the sheet music I uploaded for my previous blog entry:

I hope I didn't butcher the song too greatly. As I said in the last entry,
intonation is kind of a problem. I altered the guitar part a bit here and
there to avoid high notes on low strings, where the problem is worse. Kwansei
recorded me twice, so I had two videos to splice together, but I just took
the soundtrack from one video. I couldn't resisted embedding a few photos
from my weekend trip to the Wilder Kaiser mountains.
  
  
Thanks to Kwansei for the help, and the rest of the family for putting
up with my constant practicing! Thanks to Mike Oldfield for an amazing
song from an incredible album.
