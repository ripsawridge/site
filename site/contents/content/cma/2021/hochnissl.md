A great climb of Hochnissl in new hiking boots! With new poles, and a new
pack too! Wow. Very fun.

Looking to the north and west from the ridge below the summit:

Nothing remarkable to report, only once again to wonder at the relentless
steepness of this trail, and the curious nature of southern Karwendel slopes.
Enormous *latschen* fields tilted at 70 degrees. Vast screes, sometimes basins
and other times ramps between cliffs. The trail, one foot-width wide, somehow
blasted in place, possible a deal with the devil was made and they appeared,
in their mass from the Mieminger Kette across Innsbruck all the way to the
Rofan Mountains. There is barely a millimeter for error on the bright
gray, shining slopes. The ridgecrest is a relief -- finally, a small
stripe of horizontal ground! Though the sobering north sides wake you up
real quick. I've never seen them without snow plastered on unfriendly,
icy faces.

It's just a hard place, for hard men and womenfolk of the hills.

The mountain was crowded today. I ground out the 1700 meter ascent in 3 hours
and 20 minutes, but still I was passed by several people and I never overtook
anyone. My God, the Austrians are healthy! My 8:45 start was apparently much
too late. On the ridge crest I finally got tired of counting the people
coming down (over 15). There was less snow than I had the week before on
the Maukspitze, but these boots provided a feeling of more safety for
what snow there was. I wouldn't have had to turn around below the summit
of the Ackerlspitze with these, hmpf!

Cool peak on the way down, the Schneekopf. Wow, there is a trail on it!

I'm curious about other peaks and trails in this steep and difficult part
of town.
