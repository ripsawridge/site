After work I hiked up Grubereck from Kreuth. Interesting steep forested valley
climb to a saddle north of the summit. Lots of logging here. I thought I'd
go over to the Risserkogel but I was getting hungry so I headed down to
the south, then made the long road walk out to the main road and back to
town. About 1100 meters up/down.
