* South Early Winter Spire and others
* May 8-9, 1999

As we roped up at the base of the colouir, the steep hard snow above was looking
easier and easier. Eager for it, I started up first, with Steve then Jeff
following on the rope. Almost immediately, I realized this was {\em the steepest
snow I'd ever climbed}, and was sort of inventing techniques on the fly. As if
that wasn't enough of a challenge, Steve's left crampon came off twice, and I
chopped a stance out of the hard snow while Jeff helped him adjust it. Once I
had a secure platform I felt bad, realizing I had rained chucks of ice on them
while I built it. This didn't stop me from doing it again the second time!

After watching Jeff jog up the steep slope, totally making
light of my difficulties and pissing me off, I was ready to 
give up the lead. The angle lessened, and
we entered a thin, steep walled gully, with rocks poking
through the snow at intervals. Jeff set a fast pace, punctuated
by occasional calls for rest stops from Steve or myself.
Calf muscles burned from constant front-pointing in
the hard snow. But the view, and the fantastic position in
this wild place kept our spirits high, and our vocabulary
small: 


"This is awesome!"


"Man, this is great!"


"Holy cow, there is nothing so cool! ... hang on, lemme rest!"


There were two rappel anchors, which we clipped as we went up.
These provided some security while we were attached, but for
fully half the route we depended on the ability of the other
two members on the rope to stop a fall by one. *Needless to say,
we were very careful.*


At the top of the colouir, Jeff turned left, and scrambled up
a mixture of snow and rock, his crampons sticking well onto
faces of knobby stone. Steve followed nicely, and I talked to
Mr. X (*I don't want to reveal his identity without permission,
but I'll bet some of you could figure it out)
for a few minutes, who had just wandered up behind
us. Jeff belayed me up, and there we stood, looking at the
wildest patch of mountains in the United States. Jagged peaks
rose and fell to the horizon in every direction. Dark clouds
shortened the view west, but added to the mystery of the ranges.
Mr. X pointed out his first ascent lines on Tower Peak and
The Golden Horn to the north.


It was only around 1:00 PM, so we headed down for more adventure.
Jeff wanted to ski in the basin where we camped. He gave a nice
belay down to the top of the colouir, then continued quickly
down to the first rappel anchor. I went down last, facing into
the steep snow and making small talk with a crowd of climbers
heading up. From the rappel anchor, we made a quick double rope
rappel to the next anchor, where Jeff continued down unroped.
Unfortunately, there was no
rappel for the steepest part. Steve,
sensing my apprehension, offered a belay from a picket pounded into
the snow. I decided against it, rationalizing that I've got to
learn to do this sometime. I went down first, quite cautiously,
finding it hard to gage if I felt secure with my crampon and
ax placements or not. Steve and I unroped at the base, and
called it a good climb.


For giggles and bile, we traversed a corniced ridge above
camp, and over to the high pass under Blue Lake Peak. We saw
Jeff experience some great skiing, and an equally great wipe
out...*arms and legs flailing!* He skied up to the pass, and
we set off to climb Blue Lake Peak. It was short and very steep,
but previous parties had kicked excellent steps up the wall
of hard snow. Jeff got a few pictures, and we descended before
rain clouds to the west could overtake us. We made a slow, steady
descend, mindful of the long drops to a valley on each side!


The last event of the day was watching Jeff and another skier
jump off cornices under the peak. Mr. Y, one of Mr. X's brothers,
was taking photographs,
and his skier had to make several jumps before the shot was
perfect.


Long Night
---------

We piled into the tent early, around 6:30, 
for the warmth and chance
to get off our feet. It was crowded, but we had a good time,
making up all kinds of jokes. We considered ripping Steve's down
bag open just for the fun of throwing feathers around. I took
a lot of ribbing because I had forgotten the stove fuel at
home, necessitating a big carry of water from the car. Had we been cold and
uncomfortable I would have suffered immense guilt! But, warm
and tired, we dined on tuna fish, bagels, and some kind of
dense, carrot-cake-like substance Jeff brought called "Pemmican."


We were mildly worried about a party on the SW Arete, where a member
was being lowered slowly over a period of hours. Finally, around
9 PM, they were safely down. I found out the next day that someone
in the group had gotten scared due to the exposure, and was unable
to continue, even to rappel down.


I didn't think I slept too well, but Jeff complained loudly about
my nocturnal nostrilations in the morning. It was a long night,
but there were many events of the day to think about. We had
all been captivated by the way snowflakes drifted up past us
in the colouir. Visions of looking down the chute as these little
white flakes floated by pleasantly congealed in my mind.


A Gray Dawn
---------

Rising to a gray, cold, snowy morning, we settled on Jeff's idea of climbing
Copper Peak, 2 miles to the southeast, rather than the rock climb of the SW
Arete.  Steve and I plunge-stepped 1500 feet down from the high pass, descending
past two small basins. The filtered morning light made it hard to tell the angle
of slopes ahead. We kicked little snowballs ahead of us to see if they rolled
downhill or stayed in place!  Jeff skied by, finding the icy snow difficult to
ski.


Just above the valley trees, we traversed across avalanche paths, mindful
of conditions and planning our escape routes should danger increase
in the heat of afternoon. Avalanches had roared down every snowy face
in the isolated valley.


Our confidence that the cold of morning would last prompted us to cache
snowshoes and wend a way up to the long west ridge of Copper Peak.
After some hard work, we met Jeff on the ridge where it steepens.
200 feet of steep, exposed snow began abruptly at a short vertical
patch, easily negotiated with the help of a hapless tree. Insulted
by my familiarity, she covered me with snow. I followed Jeff who
nervily portaged skis and poles up the hard 35 degree slope.


After a brief rest, Jeff re-attached skis leaving Steve and I to
sink in 3 feet of powder. We learned to find wind-packed or steeper
areas for easier walking, and soon we stood on the summit, looking
back to Blue Lake Peak, into the Copper River valley, and across
to forbidding north ledges on Stilleto Peak. Steve was concerned
about getting down soon, and back up to the Blue Lake pass before
the snow became dangerous to travel on. First though, we watched
Jeff descend a steep colouir high on the ascent ridge. After a
few sharp turns and narrow escapes, he was clear, and off to
sunny wanderings in the valley. I cursed my uncertainty on steep
snow as we descended, tense and facing into the snow on slopes which
Steve had nimbly scampered turned sideways. 


Once down from that steep portion, we merely had to slog across the valley
and up to the high pass under Blue Lake Peak. Time to slow down and
enjoy the country, because we were on our way home. At this stage I
start trying to burn the scenery into my memory, and a melancholy
feeling sets in as I plod towards civilization. We watched Jeff ski
up the slopes on a long traverse, and Steve set off on his track.
We spread out, each with our own thoughts, periodically checking on
the others on this long white slope. When the wind died we slowed down
in the suddenly oppressive heat. I found it easier to climb straight
up rather than complete the long traverses Jeff laid out for us.


Finally, long after Jeff had disappeared over the pass, Steve and I reached
it and climbed down the other side via bucket steps beside the great
cornice. I glissaded down to camp, cold powder snow taking my breath
away, and leaving my face half-frozen in the end! We found Jeff resting
there, and after some good water we packed up and started down. Jeff
lightened our loads since he expected to be at the car early via some
fancy skiing. As it turned out, glissading, plunge-stepping and a
fast pace through the forest brought us up close behind. 


A nice drive back on highway 20, some Mexican food, and safely home again
to loving arms! We all had a tremendous time, and set a new benchmark
for fun.
