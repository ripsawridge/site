### Index Climbing, 7/22/04
Rudy and I were back (3 weeks later?) for a quick morning climbing fix.
He led Japanese Gardens to the mid-pitch double bolt anchor as a warm up.
I top roped it, found it fun and fairly easy - a great warm up. Leaving gear
in place, he re-led, then reached the first crux after a tricky lieback/offwidth
section. Getting good gear above a bulge, he set off on shallow cuticle jams (5.11b),
and lobbed off just as his right hand reached a great fingerlock. It was
an exciting 20 foot fall, which woke him up nicely. The tiny TCU he placed
in a finger pocket held. After sending the move, he reached the second crux (5.11c)
and had a similar problem, again overcome after one fall.

Now I had to somehow climb it, yikes! I repeated the first section,
finding it harder now that the sun was beating on the crag. I had some
trouble moving from lieback to offwidth, but got it on the second
try. The first crux was incredibly hard I thought.  I flailed around
greatly, eventually "grokking" the 2-3 moves required to reach a
great finger pocket. A bit tired, I climbed a hand crack up to a big
stem, then positioned for the final crux - a real monster! I made the
first moves but never did figure out the next two or three needed to
get into a solid crack above. Once on the ground Rudy could explain
the kind of dynamic nature of it - hands on a shallow ledge, walk your
feet up quickly and lunge for the crack. Sounds so easy now! (yeah
right). A few more moves reached the anchor. What a great climb,
something to work on for me definitely!

The wall was baking even at 9 am, so we repaired to the Inner
Wall. Rudy gave me beta for Toxic Shock (5.9), and I climbed up, a
little frazzled from the previous hard climb.  Nonetheless, I found my
kidneys turning yellow from the shock of steep liebacking, then an
awesome, bomber vertical hand crack. Rudy climbed it, then I scrambled
the variation 5.8 start to the route. Halfway up Rudy tossed me a rope
to tie on to so I wouldn't hit the ground if I fell. Good idea, oh
wait, that was my idea! It's a great variation, definitely do both.

Off to work, sad to leave the granite planet!
