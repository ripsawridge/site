### Mount Dickerman, 10/24/04}
On the spur of the moment, I left the house for a hike up
Mount Dickerman. It had been a few years since I was there, and I thought I'd
see what the first big snowstorm had done to the high country. I started
hiking at 1:30 pm, through damp but pleasant forest. The sword ferns looked
exceptionally dark green and healthy. Once above the dense forest slope I
saw patches of blue sky, and unobstructed views across the valley to
Big Four Mountain, Vesper Peak, Sperry and Del Campo, the latter partially
shrouded in cloud. The light was quite dramatic, because a dense gray band
of cloud over those mountains shaded and blackened them, but enough
sun could peak through to bath me in sunshine. The snow became deeper, 
and I appreciated the packed-in trail as depths reached two feet below the summit.
A quick look around at peaks to the south (Sloan looked especially nice,
though beshrouded), then it started to snow on me. Clouds engulfed the upper
slopes and I hiked away, back to the deep valley at 5:15 pm.
