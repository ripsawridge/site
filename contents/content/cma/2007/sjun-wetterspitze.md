### Obere Wettersteinspitze hike
_June 17, 2007_

I had the morning free, so I took a quick look at the computer to find a new
trail. My father-in-law was sleeping in the map and book room, and I didn't
want to wake him, so I just skimmed a map online to find a trail leading from
Mittenwald to the Obere Wettersteinspitze in 1200 meters of elevation gain.
That sounded like a good hike, plus it would take me to an area I've rarely
visited. I just had to remember to park on the west side of town, and follow
signs to the Lautersee. From there, I hoped being able to see the mountain
would make it clear.

Indeed, all went smoothly on the several trail junctions. Once the initial
forest approach is finished, the trail can be thought of as three cliffy
sections. The first cliff was sometimes protected by a steel cable to use as a
handhold. After that, there were still plenty of sections where I had to use my
hands (especially the final cliff), but there were no more protected sections
until the last 20 feet to the summit.

It was a really enjoyable hike, with a few surprises and ever-increasing views.
You need to be very comfortable with heights, because you are often walking
along a crumbly ledge with a drop-off of several hundred feet. High on the
route I even deviated for some mid 5th class climbing in a diehedral for 20
feet (okay, bouldering not climbing :-)). Very fun, but the Wetterstein Range
has a reputation for hard but brittle rock. I can attest this is true - you
might even call the rock treacherous.

The summit views were amazing, though I only stayed 10 minutes. It took me 2
hours and 20 minutes up, and 1 hour, 45 minutes down. I carried nothing but
some water and a camera. Hiking poles would have been nice.

Here are the pictures.

Here is what the "trail" looks like on the final ascent (I call it Cliff #3) of
the Obere Wettersteinspitze. On the left you can see some red spray paint dots
marking the way (and killing the adventure :-)).

On the trail to the Obere Wettersteinspitze, there are three major "cliffs" or
steep sections along the way. Here we are looking up at the second cliff. The
third lies out of sight beyond.

Leutasch Valley below, and the Stubai Range in the distance.
