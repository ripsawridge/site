# Day One, Blasiuszeiger

I drove down the night before, escaping rain in the north, and enjoyed
a cigar and Schopenhauer's "Counsels and Maxims" sitting out under the stars.
This grim-looking man is not the "pessimist" he is so often described as.
Rather, he recognizes that here on the earth "all is vanity," and although
he doesn't talk about God, the whole thrust of his counsel and wisdom allows
room for Him. I've done too much reading "about" philosophers, but as with
Plato, when I actually read the words of one of them I'm impressed and
inspired. Two great influences on him were Kant and the *Upanishads*.
I like that he named his dog *Atman*. Now, I'm drilling into Kant as well.

But enough about that! In the morning I started hiking from the parking lot
above Partschins, and made my way to the Lodnerhütte. After a coffee there,
I doubled back into the Lafaisbachtal, and up to the Blasiuszeiger (2837 m).
Really excited to hike more of these summits!

*Looking into the Lafaisbachtal*

From the summit, I saw I could descend into the Schrambachtal with its
curious square stone ruin. In a steep gully, I decided to leave the trail
which climbed up and around to the head of the valley, and just bomb more
or less straight down to the ruin. This worked pretty well with a bit of
side-hilling to the right to avoid the really narrow-looking base of the
gully. Then I walked by the ruin and descended to meet my ascent route
about 400 meters above the Schutzhütte Nasereit. Last year I'd been
here and came down via a *klettersteig* (via ferrata) route, but this time
the trail gave me enough exercise. After a beer and some reading at the
hut, I finished my descent to the car, for a total of 2000 meters up and
down.

I had pizza for dinner, and rested for the next day.

# Day Two, Ifinger

Boy, was I sore! I hadn't been doing much in the mountains and paid for it...

I settled on doing a *klettersteig* on the other side of the valley, driving
quite high to a tourist compound called Falzeben at 1650 meters. I only
had to hike up 300 meters to reach the base of the tour called the
"[Heini Holzer Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/heini-holzer-klettersteig/)." It was named for the guy who skied down the face of
the Ifinger in May of the year of my birth. The route offers a nice view
on the steep face of his descent.

I passed various parties, and enjoyed the scrambling on this route. There was
snow on a traverse of the north side of the Kleine Ifinger, but it was
fairly harmless. A bit more scrambling got me to the summit. Nice!

I hiked down, had a beer in Falzeben, and drove home. I really like this
area.
