Those who've known me for a while might remember
what a huge fan I was of "universal basic income," or UBI as we called it in those
halcyon days along about 2013 or so. I even put a "banner" on my Twitter
page, indicating it was something that needed to happen NOW and well, I was there
to educate you.

I had lots of "rational" arguments for it. I won't repeat them here. For one thing,
I'm only slightly less lazy than I was then and that would tire me out. For
another, I'm suspicious of persuasion of all types. The first one fooled is the
one making the arguments.

We do things because we want to. Then we find our "reasons." I'm not being pessimistic
here. I want more understanding between us all, yes. But it won't happen if we
keep approaching each other loaded up with our shotgun-shell arguments, ready to
treat all comers as the undead.

The more of the world I see, the less of it I know. The greatest mystery is behind
this face, sitting here with pursed lips, righteously banging out my Markdown in
Vim.

The honest truth is, I wanted UBI because I didn't want to work. I wanted to be
the first in line to receive it. And why shouldn't I?

I am a "creative." My thoughts, dribbled out here and there, are bound to improve the
lives of many thousands. Therefore, if you pay me to sit on my ass until an idea
strikes me, **you have received a bargain.**

Yeah. That's what I believed. The truth is, I still kind of believe that. That is,
the idea is attractive.

Did I say this? Well, maybe I'd offer that sentiment "in jest," but only after deploying
all my "shotgun-shells" about the perfidy of the moneyed powers. How the deck is
so unfairly stacked against the downtrodden. About duty, about imperialism, naked
racism. Hell, I'd unpack arguments from family dynamics about how pathology is
"pushed" onto a scape-goat in order to avoid certain conversations. I'd speak of
avatars, memes, the mythos, "the shadow," cycles of dependency.

I pointed a thousand fingers at "the powerful," and shed a million crocodile tears
for the lost souls "at the bottom."

The whole time I was thinking about myself.

----

It's easier to do this if you don't actually know anyone "at the bottom." When you meet
one, there is likely to be a kind of soft dissonance. An oblique intersection of angles
that comes from long held assumptions that conflict with each other.

My errors have many causes. They are a tangled ball of string. I think I've identified
the primary cause above: **fear**. Fear of discomfort. Fear of work. Desire to remain
"unsullied" by the world. A stubborn belief that the world is dirty and I am clean.
If the world behaves "well," it will help me to remain so. If it fails to do this,
then it will dirty the cloak of me, and it will be entirely at fault.

Next time someone comes at you, eager to convince you to believe a certain way,
to "hold things" in a way that make them feel better (they promise), consider how great
the fear must be. After all -- there was once a chance. You and he were once children
together, whose greatest concern was whether or not you could ride the bike down the hill
once more before it got too dark and mom got mad.

But there are ways of thinking that compound the error. The first friend of error is
**abstract thinking**.

Once you have a bad idea, there is no better way to make it terrible than to enlarge it
by putting on your "thinking cap."

An individual who is in a bad way is there for a hairball of reasons: many his own,
some inflicted on him by a brusque and unconscious world. Additionally, the "badness" of
the vision of him is influenced by the psychic weather between you and the vision of him
before you. He is partially obscured by the clouds of your own beliefs.

This doesn't stop a sharp cookie from forging ahead, though! You propagate your vision
of him into a thousand copies, and sweeping statements will surely follow.

Whats more, that individual is inseparable from the *moment* in which you observed him.
Much of your observance is observance of the weather around him -- the ever-changing
conditions. It may well have been sleeting. In the sunlight of conditions two days
later, he'll be another individual. But you used "abstraction" in that moment of
observation. You learned at some point **always** to
abstract! So you take a frozen moment and extrapolate from it, constructing new
arguments from what you observe, failing to see that your accumulating "facts" have
disappeared just as a storm does.

Combining the error of abstraction with a bit of solipsism, you invade his privacy
by populating his head with your own ideas. Of course, it's not really *his* head,
it's your model of his head. But this is disrespectful nonetheless.

If we are to live as individuals, we must grant sovereignty to each other. I used to
laugh at cultures which were suspicious of images. For example, the "primitive" who
didn't want their picture to be taken, because they felt you took something of theirs.

Well, didn't you?

What are you going to do with that picture? You will look at it. This
village woman, with beautiful skin and unreadable eyes. You will populate
her head with thoughts by trying to imagine her life. You'll look at her environment
with your own eyes, then cast judgment on her for not doing something about it.
Never expressed overtly, of course. It hovers in the contextual space of the
image, just off-screen.

The problem with images is that they are **too** manipulable. They are "easy to
grip." They can be combined in "interesting" ways. They'll be used like algebra
to reach conclusions, from which action will follow as a summer storm follows
intense heat. The woman in the village would be dismayed at the result if she
could pop in a few years down the road to see what you used that copy of her for.

She might be shocked to learn how dirty she is. Or how noble and long-suffering.

Haven't we played this game long enough, you and I? We "readers," we "thinkers?"

----

In usurping the "throne" of this mans thought, I became deaf to any **actual idea**
of him, constructed with his input and care. Yes, I admit I can't avoid making an
image. However, I can be much more careful about it. I can be filled with the
dread of error in the work.

Image-making should be a kind of triangle. A negotiation between the one observed
and the observer. The image should **rise above that confluence with lines of equal length**.
Then, even if all images are destructive, this one will be minimally destructive,
because it was created in *relationship,* and relationship is our only real means
of **correcting mistakes.**

----

Had I done that, back in the day when I lived in a cave of imagery built from
my observances, stolen, as they were, without the consent of the observed, I would
have seen that others didn't view "work" as I did -- as a thing to be avoided
whenever possible.

Work, in the lives of some, is akin to breathing. It is a
basic condition of existence, and a healthful one.

Imagine an alien that doesn't need oxygen to regulate and feed bodily processes.
They would look at us with dismay:

> "Every minute? Every single minute of life you must breathe?"
>
> "Yes," you'd say. "It's not so bad. I still get things done."
>
> The creature looked offended, but resigned to this curious life. "I suppose.
> It really seems a shame, though."

Work is a giving of oneself. It's an acceptance of finitude, which is often hard
to bear, especially if you want to feel special.

I played my inner thought that "work is terrible," though the stereo systems of
a million imagined people, and came to the only answer I could see. But I was
holding everything wrong.

I was standing at the edge of the water of life, and arguing why no one should
jump in.

Isn't it funny? My *pathology,* my "worst idea" about the nature of the world
sent me running to change that world to "look like me." Was I a virus? I think
that my behavior in this area of life did resemble one, yes.

These things are hard to see because we are more like hosts of a great dinner
party. In one corner, insurrection is being planned. In another, the Nobel
laureate offers pearls of wisdom. In the kitchen, staff works dutifully, but
not for you -- for themselves.

Now, when I see people "running," my eyes narrow. **I recognize the gait,
the urgency**. They are desperate to cover up a wound deep inside, which they
can't bear to be conscious of.

It is our way to externalize all problems. It is not even bad. But it is
certainly overused.

These days, there are many millions more incensed, desperate and furious
at "the other." At the one who must needs change, and **that right soon.**
When I felt this way, there was a constant refrain in my head: "*Why does
nobody see how benighted they are, how much harm they do to themselves
and others?*"

I know the future of these people: the world will harden against them, as
it must, because there are bonds of love between us of which we are yet
unaware. Love is firmness, at times. The mirror which apparent externality
holds up to the faces of the desperate will finally show them what they
need to see.

Or not. You see, I have abstracted again. I have imagined the "many
thousands," and populated their thoughts. I am still the fool who wants
to be paid to exist. But at least I know this, and pay myself no mind.

Re-centering my thoughts to *one* individual person, I can only say
that when one is truly healed, shame departs. I await that day, because the joy
of uncovering is great, and every one of us deserves the balm of truth
finally revealed.

Seven years hence, likely. Our complexity works against us.
