Guye Peak has been a popular climb for a long time. It rises only 2000
feet above Snoqualmie Pass, but has a very dramatic West Face for
local skiers to contemplate as they ride the chairlifts. Beckey's
Bible lists 11 different routes, not including minor variations on the
rock climbs. Hikers can choose the North Route, but will probably be
content with the South Summit, since exposed scrambling is required to
tag the Middle and North Summits. In January, Steve, Peter, Chris
K. and I took this route in ridiculous snow conditions, with the
booming of avalanches and avalanche control cannons echoing across the
valley. Routes on the steep West Face look intriguing, especially to
Peter. He has a season pass at the Alpental ski area and much occasion
to admire the face. I've been disturbed by Beckey's comment that
"much of the steep rock on the S and W faces is brittle, therefore
treacherous to the climber." Another choice comment is that "the
rock is general solid (although friable)." What am I supposed to do
with that remark?!?  But that is a story for another day, when he'll
surely lure me up!


Today, Steve and I found ourselves at the base of the South Rib, our visions of
climbing Chair Peak deteriorating with the weather. Had we come a week earlier,
we would have found consolidated snow there, with a strong crust from clear
nights. It snowed on Thursday, and fresh avalanches littered the basins. We
retreated from the bench above Source Lake, wanting to try something else while
we still had a full day.


At the rib, we approached the rock, which merely looked wet. A cold fog had come
in as we hiked up, and within an hour it would be snowing. But the rock was
covered in a thin layer of ice. I hit a boulder with my ax and saw cracks
appear on the almost invisible layer of slippery ice, realizing I was seeing
*verglas* for the first time. Gaining 6 feet of elevation on that kind
of ground was more excitement than we wanted. We knew there was a gully route
just around the corner to the right, and decided to try that, hoping for snow.

So we headed up a snow gully for several hundred feet, working our way over or around
occasional tree or rock steps. Occasionally, the gully ended in a cliff, sending us
to the right where a continuation always appeared. At one confusing point we looked
around in the mist, objects further than 20 feet were hard to make out. I spied a
solitary humanoid figure in trees to the right of our gully. He appeared to be looking
at us, and standing completely still. "Hello!" I said. Just when I decided I was
imagining the figure, it moved our way. This fellow and a companion would follow
Steve and I for most of the route.


Steve kicked steps up a particularly steep section, and we noticed rappel slings
around trees on the side of the gully every 100 feet or so. We came to a dead end,
and he led up to a ledge at the base of a cliff. Around a blind corner, Steve
had taken off his pack to squeeze through a hole between tree and cliff (going
around the tree was not an option unroped!). I followed, then we crossed a steep
gully. While Steve worked on dubious snow to escape to the right, I went higher
looking for a ledge system to take us out. Again, *verglas* proved too
intimidating, and Steve had gotten past a tricky moat, so I went back and followed
his excellent trail. Reached a low angle forested patch, we took a break. We thought
the pair below had turned around at the intimidating tree/rock hole, but they
rested and continued, later sending me email after seeing this page. They
enjoyed the climb as much as we did.
I wish I had taken some pictures at that point,
because the exposure and scenery were excellent. All near-vertical snowy
cliffs pointing down into the mist, with a couple of figures
in the colouir. You'll just have to climb the route...


We had easy walking for a while, then an impasse. We climbed leftward to a hanging
gully, but I didn't want to cross the thin snow over slabs and vegetation to get
to a lower angle snow slope. A fall would take you right over the cliff 10 feet
below. Instead, we took a rocky ledge to a thin colouir with a tree at the base.
Climbing up the colouir, we were mere feet from an exit onto easy slopes, but the
exit was guarded by icy rock that required protection. Steve hunted for another
way, but only came to a more dangerous point. So we backed down to belay at the
tree. I led off, placing a nut at the crux, then escaping to snow slopes. I decided
to run the rope out, using a sling around a tree higher up. Finally, I reached
a tree belay at the point that the South Rib and South Gully routes meet up. I
could see over to the Alpental parking lot again. Steve came up, then took off for
a lead on steep snow to a rock step that gained the ridge crest. After this exciting
bit, he reached low angle slopes, and belayed me up. We walked to the summit, having
really enjoyed this climb. We had local views of the Alpental valley, and the
tiny flea-like skiers. 


Now, we had to climb down a snow slope then belay a pitch
up to the middle summit. Steve got this lead, finding the rock blocky and fun.
Thankfully, it wasn't iced up. He placed one camming device on the pitch, then
ran the rope out to a bucket belay in the snow on the middle summit. From here,
I climbed down on snow to a rap anchor at a tree. Here, we rappelled into
the gully below the north summit. Actually, Steve climbed down on belay, then I
rappelled. By the time I pulled the ropes, Steve had kicked steps up the 50
degree snow gully to just below the north summit. We tagged this summit, then took
long strides down towards the Cave Ridge saddle. Another party had come behind us,
and descended the steep gully to the Commonwealth Basin. We reached the saddle, and
decided to go straight to the Alpental parking lot. We had some tracks to follow,
and this route was not as steep as I thought it would be. It was much quicker
than going to Commonwealth Basin. Of course, we had to walk the road for a mile.


The climb took us most of a day, but I expect that in good snow conditions, or
with previous steps to follow, this could be a great half-day outing. I'd like to
go back in early May and climb the South Rib. Thanks to Steve for a great climb!
