I snowshoed up Kramerspitz on a nice day. Slowly clouds scudded in
and by the end there was a light snow. The deep snow on the back side
was exhausting to make steps in. I nearly turned around before then!
But I continued on, running into just one person for the day, a woman
approaching the summit from a post-holing ascent directly up slope
from town. On the way down I saw her tracks diverge left and down --
very interesting! I'll have to try that way sometime.
