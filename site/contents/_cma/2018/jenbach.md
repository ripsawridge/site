## Stanser Joch 

I took the train to Jenbach Friday night, where I stayed at the
<a href="https://www.gasthof-rieder.at/">Gasthof Rieder</a>. It's
on a hill about 25 minutes walk up from the train station if you
can find the right trails in the dark!

In the morning, I dropped back into town, and started up the
Stanser Joch on a faint and steep trail. A long and silent journey up
through the deep forest...

Snow became deep enough for snowshoes, and I continued up, with only the
tracks of Gämse to keep me company. After a long time, I reached more open
country.

Above a warming hut at about 1500 meters where I drank some tea, the route-finding up the
steep rolling hills on the ridge became fun and interesting. The final
walk along avalanche control fences with broad views was gorgeous
despite an icy wind.

I thought about going down a different way, to the Bärenbadalm, but I was looking
forward to reversing my journey along the broad high ridge. Plus I wanted to save
energy for the next day. In the end, with the hill-walk back up to the Gasthof,
it was a 1600 meter elevation gain day, whew!

I had a great dinner of beer and schnitzel.

## Ebner Joch

Boy, was I sore! But I wouldn't waste a beautiful day. I made my way across fields
and through woods to emerge on a highway at the grandly titled
_Panoramarestaurant Kanzelkehre_, where I would have bought a coffee but they
weren't open yet. Now I had a long journey up the southern forested slope of
the Ebner Joch to the Astenau Alpe, at about 1480 meters. I had put on snowshoes
only just below the Alpe, and now I was happy to see that I wouldn't have to
break trail the rest of the way to the summit -- snowshoe tracks already there!
Beautiful hiking in short switchbacks to the 1957 meter summit followed.
The views were incredible. I shared the summit with another fellow, then remained
a while alone after he descended.

The way down to the restaurant on the highway was long and interesting in the upper
part for the icy trail which seemed easier on the way up! On the way down I
took a slightly different way since I didn't need to visit the Gasthof, but
the train station instead. I walked through Jenbach to the station, then waited
a while with a Radler and Apfelstruedl. Soon I was zooming home.
