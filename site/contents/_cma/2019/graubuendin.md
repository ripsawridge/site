We drove down to Susch and stayed in a little hotel where we each had a bed.
We ate dinner in the hotel to keep it easy. The next morning, I moved the
car to the train station to be picked up a few days later, and we took
a bus to the Schwarzhorn parking lot just below the Flüela Pass. The weather
was great!

We hiked into a beautiful green valley with snowy peaks at the head. Above about
2600 meters we started to notice we weren't acclimatized to the altitude, and
slowed down a bit. No matter! We left our packs and hiked up the long
South Ridge of the Schwarzhorn. There was a serious woman here, but then a
young woman came up, made some selfies and struck up a conversation.
She smiled a lot and took a picture of me and the boys. It's cool when people
are less taciturn sometimes.

Now we wandered down and stopped for a rest at a gorgeous lake underneath
Piz Radönt. I made Elijah laugh when I suggested he could take pictures of
his backpack at the lake and put them on Instagram, perhaps receiving a
bonus from friends who gave him a job for a week at the factory that sells
the backpacks. He did take a picture! Generally, if I find a thing interesting,
my fellas don't. But for this brief moment, we agreed: the lake is a beautiful
thing. Hell yeah!

We hiked rather tiredly to the Fuorcla Radönt then made the long winding trip
south along the mountainside to the Fuorcla da Grialetsch for a rude surprise.
I'd made a mistake in my planning, and had called the wrong hut to reserve
a place for the night: the Chamanna da Grialetsch was completely full!
We were told we'd need to hike down to Dürrboden for a bed. I was
initially exasperated, and knew the boys had worked hard. As it began to
rain, we made our descent. But Dürrboden was friendly, and they had bunks.
We ate a very expensive dinner (alone, more than 100 euros), but it was
delicious. "We should have just ordered french fries," quipped Elijah. He
saw that a small piece of meat wasn't really worth 40 euros! Having worked for
a few weeks, he knows the value of a dollar and I'm glad of that!

In the morning we hiked south to the Scalettapass (2605 meters). It was a gorgeous
valley, with brown stone, green fields and white waterfalls. From here, a long
trail continues south traversing high above the Funtauna valley. I love trails
like this -- not hard work, and you can look up and down and everywhere for
visual beauty.

I went ahead of the boys and took a side trail up into Val Sartiv
making for the Ravais-ch Sur lake. But I decided to stop and sit instead.
Later, I went back down and followed the Funtauna further to reach our hut for
the night. The boys were already there, and were relieved to see me. The feeling
was mutual! I was afraid that maybe they'd taken a wrong turn. "You underestimated
us," said Rowan, and he was right -- they hiked faster than I thought! Good.
They'll be safe when the zombies come, then!

At dinner we played a great game of "Dungeon." One of the features of the Dungeon
this time, was that there was an ALDI store in an underground grotto. A few dice
rolls led to Elijah getting a part time job there, but then asking an impertanent
question that meant the (monster) staff started to attack him. Meanwhile, Rowan
was engaged with a battle elsewhere for having failed to bow properly before a
(rather petty) local God. If I remember correctly, he was killed, but brought back
to life. Elijah ended up with a peg-leg but able to continue the dungeon exploration.

We sat next to a quite ambitious young mother who'd brought her very young children
up alone. Her son was entraced with my boys. If they said hello, or I smiled at him,
he'd light up like a birthday cake and go silent. Anyway, she'd done 100 kilometer
races through the mountains on foot -- quite amazing!

The next day, we hiked quickly down to the Alp digl Chants (1996 meters). It started to rain, and we
began the long march up to the Fuorcla Pischa (2867 meters). As we turned to switchback
up steep slopes to the east the rain intensified. I was glad for our umbrellas.
About halfway up, Elijah needed to change his socks because of blisters. We all worked
to keep umbrellas over him while he worked to extract dry socks, to somehow get
his feet dry (the inside of my jacket was dry and useful), and stand up again as
torrents fell all around us.

Soon enough we were in black rocks above the trees and the rain had occasional chunks of
ice. But then it let up and we could see surrounding mountains, stony and unforgiving.
I smoked a couple cigarillos in this region, called the Murtel d'As-cha. I joked about
climbing the Piz Blaisun above the pass while the boys waited for me, shivering in the
cold. Ha! Naw, I wouldn't do that. I'll shiver with them and hurry down!

Indeed, as we descended from Pischa the rain quit, views opened up of eastern Switzerland
and I was glad we were here. But the truth was, I was pretty much out of cash and wondering
how to pay for another night. I also didn't know if the Chamanna d'Es-cha just below us
would have beds for us. The boys and I talked about detouring through the Fuorcla 
Gualdauna to reach the road just below the Albulapass, then getting a ride down for a night
in town somehow. "Yes!" they said. They were willing to do another half-day of hiking after
a hard day if it meant a return to civilization, poor things. "Alright, let's do it."

We had to herd a flock of cows ahead of us for a while on the steep single-file trail. Finally we
could pass them, much to our mutual relief. Soon we were at the sunny Gualdauna pass, then moving
quickly down slippery, muddy paths to the road in the broad Albula valley.

We got to the parking lot and found that a bus wouldn't arrive for another 3 hours. I stuck out my
thumb, but no cars would stop for us three muddy men. I had a phone number for a taxi company, and
tried to call it, but it was out of service. There was no internet access so I couldn't figure out
any other number. So, we decided to walk down for a while and hope.

Elijah then noticed a camper van just ahead of us pulling out. "Ask them!" he said. I ran up and
did so. The driver said "yes, we try it," and allowed us to climb in and take off our muddy shoes.
He and his wife were from Germany, and had just climbed the Piz Kesch that we slept below the
night before. Unfortunately for them, the heavy rain that affected us meant they saw only the
inside of a cloud on the summit. We had a great talk over many shared mountain experiences while
they drove us down to the train station in La Punt. It was just wonderful to have had the ride and
the chat. "See boys, the mountains are good!" I said.

A 45 minute train ride got us back to Susch and the car. I wanted to escape the high prices of
Switzerland, so we drove to Lermoos in Austria to sleep. The kids had a wonderful "submarine" room
where they could play games on their phones to the hearts content. Look at 'em, so happy:
