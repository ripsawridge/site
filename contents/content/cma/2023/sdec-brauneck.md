### Brauneck ski tour
_December 1, 2023_

First ski tour of the year! Heck, first ski tour in two years?! Terrible.
Anyway, it was raining at the trailhead but after an hour climbing it turned
to snow. It's been quite a while since I've done this tour so my memory of
it was dim. But I just followed the tracks. I had to learn to ski again on
the way down and gosh...it was fun! I left in increasing snow.
