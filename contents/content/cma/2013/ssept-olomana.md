### Olomana complete traverse
_September ?, 2013_

I did a complete traverse of the three Olomana peaks and accidentally spiced it up even more by climbing an unknown route up the MAIN peak on steep cliffs to the right of the trail. You see, I thought I was climbing up the backside of the third peak, and I was continually thinking "where are those ropes people talk about?" Anyway, I was dumbstruck on reaching the trail. The cliff, a broad and indistinct ridge, required some serious cunning to safely manage the loose rock and debris occasionally secured by small, stout trees. By comparison to that, going down the Ahiki Backside was a walk in the park. I think it was 5.5 hours car to car.
