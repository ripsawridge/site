I hiked up Wendelstein. The last part to the summit was tedious, but all good.
Then I drove over to Fischbachau and hiked up to the Kesselalm.
Terrible traffic on the way home meant an impromptu trip to the sauna
in Spitzingsee. All good!

1400 meters total, up and down.

"Weg gesperrt" means way closed. As usual, I went on anyway.

I love the mountain deer (Gämse) sitting down there.

Here you see people relaxing unaware that there are Gämse relaxing too!

She was disappointed with the view.
