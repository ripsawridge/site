Thanks all for you well-wishes. I have to admit, things are getting better,
and the worst never came to pass last Thursday. Kris didn't get sick, and
the boys are full of spit and vinegar again - they finally adjusted to
the time change.
  
  
Our furniture arrived and with it a great gust of normalcy. The kids frenzied
about the room from old/new toy to toy, and Kris and I slept gratefully
on our ol' bed. The crick in my neck from the "airbed" died a natural death.
  
  
Life is improving!
