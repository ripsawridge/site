### Herzogstand
_May, 2007_

A morning hike up Herzogstand, then jogging along the ridge to Heimgarten, a slightly higher peak. Excellent views of the Karwendel Range, though a bit hazy. A little over 3 hours from car to car, carrying nothing. This was pretty tiring! The hiking guidebook says it should take 6.5 hours :-p.
