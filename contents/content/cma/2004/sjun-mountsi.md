### Mount Si, June 17, 2004
Went for a quick hike up Mount Si after work. I made it to the top of the
Haystack 1 hour 35 minutes after leaving the car, and back down in 45
minutes (after a nice long rest on top!). There is a lot of work being
done in the first 2 miles of the new trail, many new steps.
