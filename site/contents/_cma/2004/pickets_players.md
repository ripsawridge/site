Here are Aidan, Theron and Michael on Wiley Ridge, happy to be finished with
bushwhacking and yellowjacket stings!

Aidan Haley, enjoying the sunset at Picket Pass. When he is along, our
vocabulary gets a decided "gangsta" tone. He comes to the mountains to
share them with friends, and we are luckier for it.

Theron Welch where the rock gets good on Mount Fury. He sees Orcs and
Wizards around every corner, and this keeps him heading out into the
Cascades for more punishment all summer long. "Not all who wander are
lost."

Michael Stanton warms his hands on Mount Challenger. Like Theron, he sees
the mountains as populated by magic and demons. If they ever become just
rocks and snow, he'll probably stay home and play with his extensive
Star Wars collection.

We had a most important "virtual teammate" in the form of guidebooks,
maps, emails from friends on 
[CascadeClimbers.com](https://www.cascadeclimbers.com), and inspiring
photos that give energy to a great trip like this. On the left,
Aidan and Michael absorb all they can before dropping into Luna Cirque.
