<h3>Index Climbing, March 30, 2003</h3>

Kris and I went out to Index and climbed the three pitches of
Great Northern Slab together. This was really fun, as usual.
Then Kris belayed me on a top rope of Libra Crack (5.10a).
That was pretty exciting, especially because I didn't fall.
I look forward to going back and leading it soon. 
Then I got excited to lead Godzilla (5.9+), but a slimy wet start
scared me away. We saw people on Princely Ambitions (5.9), and
I got really excited to climb that. After climbing a chimney to
a slab where I clipped a bolt, it started to rain fairly heavily.
I rationalized that an overhang above would provide protection,
and kept going. But a difficult mantel move above the bolt
convinced me I should bail. I downclimbed a bit then jumped for
the short fall onto the bolt, where Kris lowered me to the ground.
A nice guy came down and retrieved my carabiner. Foiled by rain!!
