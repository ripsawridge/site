excerpt: A fantastic time in Ortisei
---

We spent a great week in Ortisei, in the Val Gardena Dolomites. We had the
pleasure of meeting up with my old friend Robert, his buddy Goran, and Fred
Beckey, now at age 91 on his second trip to the Dolomites.

----

Saturday
----
We arrived early after a long traffic-filled drive from
Germany. Once we got into the apartment at 2 pm, I went for a jog/hike up to
a point just below Belea. We cooked spaghetti for dinner.

Sunday
----
We hiked up to Belea, then under cliffs to the Mittelstation where we
took the lift down. Great hike! Then we went to dinner with Robert, Fred and
Goran.

Monday
----
We took the kids cragging at Pusc dl Preve, along with Fred, Robert and
Goran. Goran led a nice crack ("Comici," 5b) that became my favorite route of the crag. I
belayed Fred on a short climb but his back was sore from the plane journey so he
didn't climb too much.

Tuesday
----
Robert, Goran and I climbed the Abrams Route on the Gamsband (VII),
12 pitches. Then we started the Steger Route (IV+) on Sella One but bailed after
three pitches because it looked like it was going to rain.

Wednesday
----
Kris, the boys and I took the lift up to the Seiser Alm, hanging
out for a while despite some rain in the meadows. Kris got some nice
pictures of the fellas.

Thursday

We climbed on Sasso della Palestra in the Steinerne Stadt
underneath the Langkofel. The boys and I climbed "Mammolo" (4a) and "Cucciolo"
(4a), a couple of nice short (12 m) routes.

Afterwards we had lunch at a hut near the pass with Goran and Robert, who had
just climbed the Vinatzer Route (VI-) on the Third Sella Tower. We went home and
I headed out for a hike to the summit of Pic (2342 m) above Ortisei. This was
1100 meters elevation gain. I had to run down as quickly as possible to beat
screaming wind and rain. Great fun!

Kris and the boys went swimming in
town. Later, we headed over to have a BBQ with Robert and the gang.

Friday
---
We repeated a via ferrata we'd done as a family two years before: the
Kleine Cirspitze. This time we had to buy some gear first in town. It was a
great climb, though it sprinkled for a little while and worried me a
moment. Afterwards, we had a great pizza in town. Later, the boys played in the
apartment and Kris and I went out for drinks with Goran and Robert while a World
Cup soccer game played on the bar tv to much cheering and booing.

Saturday
----
Last day! I left the house at 5:30 am to quickly climb two Sella
Towers with the guys. We hurried up 11 pitches and then ran to the car to ensure
we'd be back at 9 am. We had to pack and clean at our respective apartments. I
said goodbye to Robert and Goran, it'd been such fun! They set off to get Fred
Beckey home, and Kris, the boys and I headed back to the Steinere Stadt to climb
a few more routes. First on Sasso della Malga, we climbed "Dopolavoro" (4c),
which was quite challenging for the fellas! I led "Cengia dei camosci" (4c) and
thought it was a far bit harder. The boys took a pass on this one. We hiked over
to the Sasso della Ortiche and climbed "Duich" (4a), which also was challenging
but fun. Then we played "monster" in the rocks for a while, went for some
Kaiserschmarrn, and then made the drive back to Germany.
