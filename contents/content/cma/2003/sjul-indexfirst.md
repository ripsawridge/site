<h3>Index Climbing, July 1, 2003</h3>

Alex and I came late after work. Princely Ambitions was full (tsk tsk) so we went
to "The Country" where I led the first pitch of G.M. (5.8). The pitch had a lot
of walking on ledges, but a really nice steep flake that could be jammed and liebacked.
Alex followed, then headed up for pitch 2, which climbed awesome overhanging flakes
to a nice ledge with bolts. He clipped a bolt, then launched off for "Heart of the Country,"
a sweet 5.10a handcrack that led to more bolts up and right. Problems with rope drag
and maybe too much protection tired him out pretty good, so he lowered off and sent
me up to reach the anchor. I really enjoyed climbing up to the high point via jamming,
liebacking, and good fingerlocks. I rested there for a moment, then enjoyed the
sinker hand jams to the final bit, where I placed a last piece of gear. Above, I 
kept jamming until I reached the ledge. Wow what a great climb!!! Alex came up, also
really happy with it. We rappelled, then Alex TR'd "Phone Calls from the Dead (5.11b)."
It looked like a pretty neat climb, but the rating scared me away. Alex worked on
a dicey mantel move above a pleasant crack system, then came down. He convinced me
to give it a try. I was stopped by the same move, then contrived to do it a little
differently by using two hands on the good handhold on the right, then rock onto
my left foot placed a little lower and closer to me than was intuitive. It took several
tries, but it eventually worked. Above, I pinched some knobs then reached an edge that
could be gripped from the right, and provided easier progress for a few steps.
It was getting late, and my last moves involved a sucker hold on the left that left
me standing up on knobs with nowhere to go. I should have moved right towards the
chain anchors. Pretty fun actually! Another rappel reached the ground, and eventually
home.
