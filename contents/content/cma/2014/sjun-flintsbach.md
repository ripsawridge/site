### Flintsbach
_June 3, 2014_

1. Nur Fliegen ist schoener (7-), extended the climb into an anchor above, right at 30 minutes of climbing. It might have been into Normalweg (5+) or McFisto (6+/7-).
2. Felsrowdy (6+/7-) - first pitch fairly easy (5).
3. Felsrowdy P2 (6+/7-) - Hannes led this fine slabby pitch.
  Then we dropped down the other side to climb in the rain.
4. Steinlaus (6-)
5. Fliegenschiss (6-) - with correct exit, right and up, rather than left.
6. Miles Davis (6-) - I had failed to understand the step between clips 2 and 3 before.
7. Knabenkraut (6+) - quite wet. Several times, downclimb and rest at the crux move. Finally I found a sequence that worked for me:
  * left hand in pocket, right on chalky hold, stand up
  * right hand on lower half of high lieback hold. Bring left foot up to ledge and stand up.
  * right hand adjusts to upper half of high lieback hold
  * right foot inserts into chalky pocket, left foot goes far left onto slab, finds high good foothold on far left.
  * left hand reaches up for small ledge in right side of dihedral at head-height.
  * right foot now comes up to chalked crest hold.
  * adjustments of hands, left hand goes in pocket below bolt, right hand goes where left was.
  * continued adjustments allow clipping, and then finishing route.
  Just to note, Hannes found a hold below the "pocket below bolt" in the crack that might make things a lot easier.
8. 99 Karat (7+) - led with one fall, several rests
9. 99 Karat (7+) - again, on top rope, no falls or rests
