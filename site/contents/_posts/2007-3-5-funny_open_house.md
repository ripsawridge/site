Kris, the boys and I went to a Kindergarten today, and had a fun time.
The boys really loved a mini tree-house in the building. I would reach
in and tickle them. "Teekle!" said Rowan. There were two older kids there
who I played with a while. I had to speak in German which was a great workout.
The boy had a spaceship of sorts made of Legos. I asked him for one Lego,
then I pretended it was huge, and contained 4000 sleeping people. He added
wings to it, so it became a container ship to hold 8000 people. I made
it fly slowly from Earth to Saturn, explaining that the journey took 100
years. The little girl thought that was crazy, so I explained how the people
take a pill and go to sleep. When they wake up, they think only 5 minutes
passed. Then I showed how sometimes, when they fly back to Earth from Saturn,
they go off course! "und sie sind verloren! (they are lost)". Their eyes
widened and they looked a little afraid. Uh-oh, I scared them! "Okay but
then they wake up and realize they have to turn around," I said, and there
was relief all around. So they go back to Saturn. "The people will be very
hungry," I said. "And thirsty!" said the little girl. She went off to get
some eggs and apples for the people. Elijah and Rowan came up at this point,
with a big collection of plastic eggs. The girl sort of bargained with
them for some eggs. We fed the 8000 people the eggs, and put on a play
for them involving a horse. "That's a donkey!" said the little boy. He
was mad when I said stuff in English, he made sure I always said the German
word too. The little girl loved putting on plays to entertain the 8000
weary interstellar travelers. So that was fun.
  
  
Kris told Elijah to get his bike out of the kitchen today, and he said
"why?" She was shocked. But she said "because I'm making your breakfast
and the bike is in the way." So he took the bike out. That is the first
"why..."
