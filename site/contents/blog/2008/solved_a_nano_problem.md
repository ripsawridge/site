title: Solved a Nano problem

For a few weeks I noticed that certain podcasts wouldn't sync to my iPod
Nano. I searched on web forums and apple support without finding any answers.
I would drag a selection of mp3 tunes from the iTunes main window to the
Nano within iTunes, and only some of the songs would transfer. I would
never buy any DRM'd music from Apple so the problem has nothing to do with
authorization.
  
  
So then I looked closely at the filenames. The files that didn't transfer
had "funny" characters like "?", "\_", "'" (single quote) and "!". After
renaming these file in iTunes, I had the nice feeling of seeing the Nano
accept the files.

Now this is with the latest firmware for the Nano and iTunes software
(7.6 (29)) as of Friday Feb. 8, 2008.
  
  
I saw many sad people posting about this problem on forums across the
web. And the Apple troubleshooting page had the usual "reboot, reset, restart"
crap. Which didn't work. I can't believe something this simple isn't generally
known?
  
  
So I hope people find this. Let me help:
  
  
"Nano won't sync certain songs."
  
  
"iPod won't sync certain songs."
  
  
"Help please: some songs won't sync to my Nano."
