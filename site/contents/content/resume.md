# Resume

I have 25 years of systems programming and application development experience.
I enjoy working with
teams of motivated people in a mix of leadership and independent
contribution roles.

## Languages

* Proficient in: C/C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, x86/x64 assembly language
* Fammiliar with: Java, Python, Node, unix shell

## Technologies

* C++ - Boost, STL, VTK, Windbg and GDB debuggers
* C# - WPF, Spring.Net, ActiViz (VTK binding)
* Java - Spring, Hibernate, Ant, Maven
* Linux - Docker, Vim, Bash/Shell
* Source Control - Subversion, Git

## Experience

**Senior Software Engineer: 2012 - 2021**<br>
**V8 Team**<br>
**Google Corporation, Munich, Germany**<br>
<br>

* V8 is the JavaScript compiler and runtime environment shipped in Google
Chrome and Node.js, providing optimized code execution to over a billion
users. V8 received the ACM Programming Languages award in 2016 for its
significant innovation in JavaScript ([link](https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/)).
* Led a team of senior developers to produce the TurboFan optimizing JavaScript
compiler, shipping in V8 since 2017.
* Led the project to make TurboFan fully concurrent, challenging because the
compiler must introspect deeply into continually mutating data structures to achieve high
performance. Success required the creation of new
heuristics, programming idioms, and testing modes such as TSAN (Thread Sanitizer).
Shipping in Chrome since November, 2021.
* Adapted V8 to support the Intel CET Shadow Stack, new hardware meant to
prevent ROP attacks.
* Developed the Feedback Vector to collect runtime feedback in JavaScript
programs. This enabled adding an interpreter to V8 in 2015.
I presented the work at AmsterdamJS in 2017 ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7zRSm8jzvA)).
* I hold a patent for AllocationSites, a method for choosing ideal representation
of arrays, and serving as a pretenuring platform for generational garbage
collectors. Shipping in V8 since 2014, and presented at the ISMM conference
in Portland, 2015 ([ACM paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2754169.2754181)).
* Spoke often to university students about working in V8, at Google, and in the
software industry in general from my experience as an individual contributor
and manager. Wrote blog articles to explain arcane subjects to coding
enthusiasts ([slack tracking](https://v8.dev/blog/slack-tracking), 
[exception handling](https://ripsawridge.github.io/articles/exceptions/)).

**Software Engineer Lead: 2009 - 2012**<br>
**Advanced Medical Diagnostics, Waterloo, Belgium**<br>
<br>

* Development team Lead for the HistoScanning product, which detects regions
of interest in a reconstructed, segmented prostate gland from ultrasound data.
* Implemented a re-write of the visualization system using the open
source VTK library. 
* Responsibilities included UI development with WPF,
database design and implementation (NHibernate, Spring.NET), detecting and
solving performance issues, servo-motor control, and interface API design for a
custom-built ultrasound machine. Development of a custom plugin solution to
package and ship sensitive or updatable components. Interface with research
team for special visualizations and data import/export from MATLAB.

**Principal Software Engineer: 2005 - 2009**<br>
**Avid Corporation, Munich, Germany**<br>
<br>

* Worked in a principal design role for the next-gen
  Interplay Server, which is a redesign of the previous C++ system using
  Java, Spring, Hibernate and SQL. Cross-team coordination between
  engineering teams in Munich, Tewksbury and Montreal. Employment of
  Agile development processes (SCRUM, sprints). Debugging and feature
  implementation in the legacy C++ server as well.

**Software Engineer/Lead: 1998 - 2005**<br>
**Common Language Runtime (CLR) Team**<br>
**Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington**<br>
<br>

* Led a team of 4 focused on fixing race 
    conditions, leaks and crashes in the Common Language Runtime (CLR) 
    version 2.0. Responsibilities include debugging/fixing hard-to-reproduce 
    issues, being the primary development contact for Product Support in the 
    field with Customer stress issues, and improving the product with smarter 
    coding practices and test runs.
    
* Contributed to design and implementation of managed breakpoint support in 
    unmanaged debuggers. Exceptions can optionally be raised by the CLR when 
    methods are just-in-time compiled, then handled by the debugger which 
    then has an address to set breakpoints.

* Adding and maintaining features of the SOS.DLL CLR debugging tool. Maintain 
    a blog and give presentations on the tool, geared towards debugging CLR 
    issues on servers or from dump files.

**Software Engineer: 1996 - 1998**<br>
**Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, Oregon**<br>
<br>

* Implemented the on-line update feature of an online 
    help and antivirus system. Network detection and download 
    of patches, restart after patch application, etc.

## Education

* Bachelor of Science, Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin, 1996
* 3.9 GPA in major Concentration
* Working knowledge of German, written and spoken
* Authored a tutorial on implementing structured data types in
  *Mathematica* for the book "Abstract Data Types," by Dr. Nell Dale.
