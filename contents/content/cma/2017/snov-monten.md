The boys and I were staying in Schruns for the second half of the
Herbsferien week. I took some gloves and my walkman, and hiked quickly
up the Monteneu above town. The elevation gain was about 1200 meters,
reaching a height of ~1850 meters, with only a dusting of snow near
the summit. Mostly, it was warm and wonderful as the Bartholomäberg
mountain faces south, providing a network of road and trail to the summit.
