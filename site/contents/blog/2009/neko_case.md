I'm really liking "Middle Cyclone," the new album by Neko Case. I think
my sister in Oklahoma would really like it. [Here](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2009/03/16/090316crmu_music_frerejones) is
a review from the New Yorker. Also the song Challengers from the New Pornographers
is great, she sings on that. Finally, for all things Neko Case you should
also check out this [music sampler](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/02/15/magazine/20090215_NEKOCASE.html) from
the New York Times, and the fascinating [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15neko-t.html) that
goes with it. I hope she'll tour to Munich sometime. Oohh, a double feature
with Neko Case and the Handsome Family would be an amazing show!
