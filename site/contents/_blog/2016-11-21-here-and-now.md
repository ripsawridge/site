I've been getting into Zen.

I love how merciless it is.

No belief in anything.

And I'm a pretty big fan of mystical ideas. Talk to me for about 10 minutes and
you are apt to get an earfull of crap about alternate dimensions and lucid
dreams and reincarnation. Sorry, I just like that stuff!

But Zen has no time for that. Literally: NO TIME.

If there is no time, then your sole reality is right here this second.
And any reality you give to say, dimension X, is attention you are stealing from
what's in front of you. Dimension X is "alive" as a subjective thought in your
head. Maybe it's a memory trace, because, who knows, maybe you did visit such
a dimension last night. Zen isn't concerned with saying that such a place
doesn't exist...it's rather saying that it's not important if it does have
a physical existence or not because you aren't there.

If you persist in thinking about stuff like this, then you have to reflect back
on yourself: why is it so important to you to believe in another transcending
existence beyond this one?

Is there a chance it's just another way to avoid the present? Could it be that
it's a lot like Christians who pine dolefully for a glorious heaven when this
world of tears is finished?

I've asked myself these questions, and concluded that this really is part of it
for me. That I get "bored" with regular existence, and want to speculate about
some better place. Places with more freedom or adventure.

The hilarious thing is that while I'm thinking that way, my current reality is
being leeched of interest and adventure.

So. I've got my fantasies. I even believe I've seen some things. And those
things started the journey for me into philosophy and eventually Zen.

But ideas only point to truth, they are not truth. We have to see beyond all of
them. Sometimes that means forcefully discarding ideas, ruthlessly eliminating
them from your perspective. At least, don't allow yourself to take refuge in any
idea that has the effect of removing you from the world.

If the world looks boring, then you are boring. Think about why that is. Don't
give yourself a bone that distracts you.
