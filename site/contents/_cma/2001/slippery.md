Steve and
Josh came up from Portland and attempted the East Face of
Chair Peak.  Steve ended up a rope length out searching for any kind
of pro for a belay, but the face was completely blank. Only a little
disappointed, they hiked around to the normal route, and climbed up
and down via a chimney. This was Josh's first technical climb, and he
really enjoyed it. What to do for the next day? We didn't want
something really hard, but something that offered some climbing, and
maybe a chance to see an area we hadn't been to before. Phil F. had
mentioned Slippery Slab Tower in an email a few days before, and I
read about it on Gordon's page (a lot of people involved here!).
Gordon described an alternate, very scenic approach, and said that the
tower looked spectacular from that vantage. This was perfect for our
needs. (Gordon's approach takes the trail near Tunnel Creek to Hope
Lake, then the PCT to Trap Pass, while the usual approach follows
Surprise Creek).

Josh drove us in style to the trailhead near Steven's Pass. His car
has heated seats and other amenities. These seats nearly prevented
them from a winter attempt on Mt. Hood recently - the car was just too
warm and dry! After a wrong turn, we found the trailhead and started
hiking. The trail to Hope Lake is short but quite steep for a trail in
this area. But we reached the lake quickly, and continued up to
beautiful alpine terrain as we traversed a grassy slope above the
Trapper Creek valley. Finally, the Tower came into view. It looked
formidable. Definitely easier on the left, but still impressive. This
area of the cascades has always been a mystery, and it was great to
finally visit. We came to the brilliantly blue Trap Lake with it's
ring of cliffs.  Shortly above Trap Pass, on a goat trail (well
traveled), we stopped for a sandwich.  Continuing, we soon stood at
the base of the peak. The basin below the tower is extraordinarily
scenic, with grassy benches, granite boulders and lingering
snow-patches.  We got the ropes out at the base of an obvious 3rd class
gully. Steve and I scrambled up this, and gave Josh a belay. Josh had
to endure many pronouncements of wisdom from Steve and I (especially
Steve) about the nature of alpine climbing.  Whatever he complained
about at the moment would provoke some gritty wisdom along the lines
that this was the central activity of alpine climbing! Some examples:



* "Don't like bushwhacking? That's what alpine climbing is
all about!"
* "Knowing the line between acceptable and
unacceptable risk - this is the central tenet of alpine
travel!"
* "Long, loose, horrible descents - ah, the
veritable *Quan* of the alpine environment..."
* "But
the sine qua non of the Alpine is the unprotectable lead, don't you
know?"


Josh can rest assured he'll be given many more tidbits of
wisdom. He'll have graduated when he learns to invent them himself!


Steve led the first real, (and only!) pitch. It was pretty
exciting. It involved an open book with a crack for protection, and
little smears for feet. We traversed out of the open book on the left,
and up easier ground to an anchor just below the summit. We scrambled
to the summit and added our names to the register. With the exception
of Thunder Mountain (it looked easily scrambled), all the peaks were
far. The Chiwaukum Range and Mt. Daniels provided the most spectacular
vistas. Deep, green valleys radiating away from Trap Pass were just as
beautiful.


We got down with single rope rappels (one double and two singles would
have worked too), but wanted to do a little more climbing. During the
rappels we invented the notion of the "Iron Crotch," a sort of
mid-19th century undercarriage replacement of the vitals, and the
organs of elimination and reproduction. We had seen a pointy rock upon
which we might fall during rappel. Only a devices like this could save
us. Through a sort of historical fiction narrative, we elaborate on
uses and benefits of the device, of which there was a surprising
plethora. The virtues of regularity, mental clarity, order and
durability were especially enhanced (at least with stainless steel
models), and the device would have attracted quite a following, had it
only existed.


Anyway, during this narrative, we made a believed first ascent of the
clean, light-colored granite to the right of the 3rd class gully. The
ascent climbed left of a flaring chimney, then entered the chimney
when blocked by an overhanging slab. The chimney protected well,
providing several nice hand/fist jams, until the angle relented and
the climber emerges onto the face. The face gets steadily worse in
quality, as the rock blackens and becomes rotten. Sparsely protected
and mental (but easy) climbing leads to the slung tree that marks the
regular route. The length is about 45 meters, and the rating 5.6. The
climb is called "The Iron Crotch," for obvious reasons.


After this, with plenty of time to linger in the mountains, we enjoyed
a game of bouldering. Josh and I indulged in a nap, and ate many
victuals while gazing out at the land. Josh discovered a water
fountain underneath a boulder, and it was with warm feelings that we
left our adopted basin.


The trail journey felt longer than it had in the morning, as usual,
especially a long switchbacked section above Hope Lake. At the lake,
Josh dealt with some painful blisters, and we thought about the
virtues of lakeside camps below timberline, of which there were
none. Mosquitoes, crowds, bears, lack of views. But you do have water
nearby, I guess. The very steep trail down to the trailhead went
quicker than expected, and at least Steve and I emerged at the car
completely surprised, ready to hike another mile without
complaint. When Josh arrived, he was given a capsule lesson in the
comment *"Endless trails in rooty forest while exhausted make up one
of the prime demands placed on the would-be alpine climber."* Down
to pizza at Frankie's in Redmond went the three would-be alpinists.


Thanks to Josh and Steve!
