<h3>The Tooth, July 12 2003</h3>

I had a morning free to go for a hike, and started up the Snow Lake trail planning
to do something interesting. Maybe Bryant, Chair, Snoqualmie or the Tooth? The Tooth
looked pretty good as I reached the overlook to Source Lake. I'd never been up there
with no snow before. Wow, it's definitely more tedious, as you are hopping boulders
for a mile or so. The climb was great. I was on the summit 2 hours and 10 minutes after
leaving the trailhead. I hung out for a while, then descended. I'd never taken the
North Ridge before, but found this to be a very straightforward route. On the way
out there were numerous parties on the climb. One couple arrived below Pinapple Pass, and
promptly turned around when I said there were several other parties on the route.
How can you expect solitude here on a sunny Saturday? I stopped to admire the views
above Source Lake, it's very pretty there. Once on the Snow Lake trail again, I 
encountered dozens and dozens of hikers. In one case, a man and the infant on his
back looked so alike I tripped. In another case, a woman had a dog leash attached to
her like a chest harness. The dog was still 20 feet ahead of her! Many bored teenagers
and dogs wandered by. I was back home at 12:30 pm.
