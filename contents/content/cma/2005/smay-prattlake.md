### Pratt Lake, Melakwa Lake, May 22, 2005

I went on a really really fun trail run this morning. What I did was to
cache a mountain bike at the Denny Creek trailhead, then drive back to
the Granite Mountain trailhead. I hiked and jogged the trail towards
Pratt Lake, enjoying the cool forest and nice path. There were some
views looking down on Olallie Lake and out to hills to the west.
A steep descent from a ridge top entered a boulderfield with broad
views to Pratt Lake and my trail contouring far away on the other
side. (Looking at the map now, it's hard to reconcile the line of the
trail with the way it really went. It seems like it must have been
further west, closer to Pratt Mountain). I ran on, to Lower
Tuscohatchie Lake where a sign said it would be 3 more miles to
my next destination: Melakwa Lake. Kaleetan Peak had a dusting
of fresh snow and definitely had a "Matterhorn of the Cascades"
look from here. I ate my PowerBar in a boulderfield before the
short and steep climb up to the lake. Once there, I thought about
hiking on to tag Melakwa Pass, but I needed to be home by noon.
I saw a lot of people as I quickly descended the somewhat
"technical" Denny Creek trail (lots of rocks embedded in the trail).
The falls were roaring very nicely. Once down I hopped on my bike
and rode the 3 or so miles back to my car. I took from 6:45 am
to 11:00 am for the 17 mile trip (3 on the bike). Loop trips are
so much fun!
