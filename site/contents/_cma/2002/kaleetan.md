I'd hoped to do this climb before work one morning with all the good
weather we'd had, but there was far too much to do there, and I
couldn't justify it. So I promised Kris to just be away Saturday
morning while she slept. But I failed to press the "alarm" button, and
didn't wake up until 7 am! I hurried out the door anyway, hoping to
make it a quick climb.


The radio said it was 23 degrees in Everett. I hate the way NPR tells
the same stories over and over this early in the morning. Finally I
switched to a Jimi Hendrix CD.  "Third Stone from the Sun" is one of
my favorite songs.

At the trailhead, I started hiking quickly, shivering somewhat in the
crisp air.  It's weird how this trail goes under the freeway. Cars
roared by 250 feet above.  I kept hiking, warmed up and enjoyed some
sunshine and expanding views of the Denny Creek valley. The trail
climbs in steps, reaching a middle tier protected from highway
noise. Two campers came down, they had a very cold night at Melakwa
Lake, but the stars were beautiful. Curious to see what Melakwa Pass
looked like, I hastened on. I hiked up 2000 feet in the first hour,
which made me tired on the way home. The pass was lightly forested, as
I had read. From here, a short traversing descent on a very icy trail
led to the lake, devoid of persons.


My instructions, courtesy of "Smoot's Bible," were to hike a short
trail to the sanctioned latrine, then continue up a steep ridge to
reach the peak. I did this in increasing snow, catching sight of
tracks made some days before. The hike along the ridge was fun, and
had a short rooty scrambling section. I came out of the trees to a
large cairn and wide views. The west face of Chair Peak was
intriguing, with many gullies and ledges. Continuing, I reached a
point where the guidebook, (and associated tracks) advised descending
to a shallow basin. With the fresh snow it looked kind of steep, and I
preferred to be classy and sassy. I followed the brushy but jagged
ridge crest, hoping that I could reach the base of the scramble route
to the summit.


Sometimes I traversed on the west side, getting covered in snow from
tree limbs and knee-deep drifts. Sometimes I followed rocks on the
east, loving the warm sun and dry rock. Often I was right on the
crest, but learned to be leery of descending the north sides of the
towers. Slick, unconsolidated snow covered the slabs, making for
insecure footing. On descents I tried to hand-traverse with my hands
on the crest and body on the sunny east side, using nubbins and cracks
for boot purchase.


If I make that sound hard it wasn't, it's just that the snow on the
rock required me to be more careful on what would normally be a
mindless scramble. The exposure down to the lake was exciting. It took
me more than an hour to traverse that patch of ground, time I
begrudged on my schedule, but it certainly was interesting!


I met the trail to the summit scramble, followed it to it's logical
conclusion, and emerged on top. It was 10:45 AM, 3.5 hours after I
started. I sat in the still air, admiring the quiet hills in all
directions. I loved being here, but I really wanted to spend time with
Kris, so after a brief visit, I hurried down. This time I went into
the basin, traversed it, and hiked back up to the ridge in somewhat
difficult snow conditions. It was a light, slippery layer, just enough
to obscure any trail that might exist in the steep heather. I pulled
myself up the slope with the aid of shrubbery.


I made it back to the lake, drank some water, got cold, kept
going. Going down from the pass I met countless parties, most with
dogs. I tried to answer their questions truthfully, but I really had
no idea how long it would take them from point X or Y.  Now that I
think about it, I was telling them what they wanted to hear! At first,
I said "hmmm, a full hour." The man expressed great disappointment, so
for the next tired party, I lowered it to "45 minutes" (though this
party was 400 feet lower).


In short, I am unreliable. I will lift your spirits only for the time
being.  When hopes are dashed on the rocks of darkness and hunger many
hours later, my visage will float to the surface of the mind..."HIM!"


So I hurried all the more, reaching the car at 2:00, and home at 3:00,
bearing groceries for a somewhat miffed, but ultimately forgiving
wife.


I like to harass my friend Peter Chapman for a "Mountaineer's
Snoqualmie Summits Pin," because I once read that organization gave
them out at various lodge meetings.  He says that doesn't exist
anymore. Curiously, he looks away when making such statements, and
cites pressing business elsewhere when I inquire further. At this
writing I've browbeaten my way up Thompson, Lundin, Red, Snoqualmie,
Guye, Denny, Tooth, Chair, Kaleetan, Silver and Abiel. I posit that I
am worthy to stand in some hallowed lodge, ruddy in the firelight,
shivering with anticipation!

I guess I can make my own pin...
