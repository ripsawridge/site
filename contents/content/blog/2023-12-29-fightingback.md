It's been bad. It's getting worse. Now look where we are.
We're all ready to accept that Satanism is "just another religion."

Does anybody still think this is openminded?

It's the black hole of an empty mind.

Here is a great article about it from [the Spectator (paywalled)](https://spectator.org/which-way-western-man-satanic-idols-or-christian-morality/):
