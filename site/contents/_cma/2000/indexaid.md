* October 1,22,24, 2000

Peter and I needed some aid climbing practice, and we knew we could do
this in the rain.  We headed to Index Sunday morning, and were soon
racking up below the climb "City Park," rated C1 as aid, or 5.13c for
alien free climbers. Peter had the dubious task of getting to the
first bolt of a 6 bolt ladder. With admirable composure, he felt his
way up the dripping slabs, fingers mingling with the spiderwebs in
little pockets of granite.  He clipped the bolt, and continued up,
soon realizing that the "two aider system" wasn't the best for
sustained aiding. I gave it a try with my "four aider system."  Of
course, this was a breeze! Soon I approached the long, very thin crack
that characterizes this climb. One by one, I left thin stoppers in the
crack and continued up. But with a long way yet to go, I was out of
thin gear! I was able to traverse left to a 2 bolt anchor (very reachy
traverse!), and belay Peter. We only had about 5 nuts small enough for
the crack, which stretched for another 70 feet above! Time for some
shopping. Peter climbed the route and cleaned gear, enjoying the
deluxe four aider system. We rapped from the bolts, and couldn't wait to
go back!

In the following weeks, Peter had purchased about 15 small nuts, and I 
had three more. Peter
led pitch one, doing a marvelous job. I followed the pitch,
re-climbing it and cleaning gear. Sadly, 3 nuts couldn't be cleaned, no
matter how hard I tried.  Feeling pretty bad, I continued on to the
second pitch, and aid climbed that.  To make things worse, I dropped
one of my aiders at the belay, having to borrow one from Peter.  On
the second pitch, my spirits improved as I enjoyed the straightforward
but exciting aid climbing.  After a few free moves, I reached the
belay, and Peter re-climbed the pitch.  Index, Gunn, and Baring Peaks
were beautiful. Many trains went by. Much shooting occurred at the gun
club below. We did a single rappel, then a double rappel to the
ground. We were surprisingly sore!


Peter couldn't bear the thought of losing those 3 nuts, so after
chewing on that for a while, he sent me email: "Want to go free our
poor brothers from the crack this week?"  That was Monday, so Tuesday
morning I started the first pitch at 7:15 am, reaching the belay at
8:20. My goal had been to climb it in one hour, so I felt pretty good.
How much quicker can I possibly aid that climb? Sadly, a clever
individual had come up the day before and removed the nuts. Today we
had a hammer, and Peter found that a few light taps help to remove
welded nuts.  So, we learned something else. Peter jumared the route. We
were back at the car after 2 hours, and off to work.


Together we've made some good strides in our aid climbing. Now it's time
for A2!!
