After running an errand with Tamara in the morning, I had some time for
a hike. I'd seen a mountain called Government Peak on the map behind
Wasilla which looked doable. I drove up to the parking lot, paid a fee,
then hiked up, first to a sub-peak called Blueberry Hill. The trail was
steep, and pretty brushy from the Hill until gaining the East Ridge
proper. Grand views everywhere!

*Still a good ways to go...*

Pretty soon the brush decreased, the trail steepened, and the wind picked
up, adding an alpine flavor to the day.

At the top there was a little building with solar panels and views in
every direction. It is enough to give you "peak fever," there are so
many other goals to attain here.

On the way down I took the South Ridge, which got quite steep in the
lower part. Here I ran into a guy who suggested a hike up Matanuska Peak,
a tougher hike, visible off to the east. I half-planned to do that Thursday,
but the weather was bad then, and I was a bit tired from the big day
on Wednesday when we did a boat tour out of Seward. It'll have to be
next time!
