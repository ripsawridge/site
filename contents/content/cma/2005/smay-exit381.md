### Exit 38 Climbing, May ?, 2005

Carlos and I hiked up to Peanacle Point this morning before work for some
climbing. We both led a nice 5.8 climb just left of Gallivant (5.10a). Then
we climbed Gallivant, which I'd first visited a year before with Josh.
Next we went around to the back side and climbed a really fun little route
called "Awannadoya" (5.9). We jogged back down to work. We just had to climb
a little more, so we got in a few pitches at Marymoor Park as the
rain started sprinkling. I really enjoyed the 5.10c/d version of a face on
the Pinnacle, where you aren't allowed to grab edges of the "rock" and have
to stay on the face only.
