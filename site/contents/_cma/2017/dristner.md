Me and the boys stayed in Dornauberg for 5 days in a _Ferienwohnung_.
Mostly I let them take it easy, but one day we hiked to the Olperer Hütte.

We also did a Klettersteig near Mayrhofen (though I forgot the name). It was
crazy hot! But kinda fun. :)

## Dristner

_I later made a "Mountain Page" for Dristner at Summitpost.org, you can
check it out [here](https://www.summitpost.org/dristner/1001336)_.

During the stay I got obsessed with the mountain Dristner which can be
climbed right from town. There was a Klettersteig at the base of the mountain which
I soloed one evening. Pretty fun! I made a 1 hour exploratory hike up the steep
forested ridge, then came back two days later to do the whole thing.
While the boys slept hard after playing video games on my computer the night before
I set off up the trail.

After a good long ways, I reached two buildings, one of which had a spring to refill
my water bottle, yay!

From here, the trail gets quite steep, especially once it's on the ridge proper.
I would not want to be here when the grass is wet!

I'd love to climb the mountain from Mayrhofen one day. From Dornau, it was already
1750 meters elevation gain and loss...that could be made bigger by starting lower!
