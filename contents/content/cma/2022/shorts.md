### Wildbarren
_December 31, 2022_

I hiked up Wildbarren on a fine day, certainly too warm for the season.
I met an amazing couple on top, Ulrich and Ira. Truly expert climbers...also
scientists that write interesting papers ([here](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1), an index to their papers
on the physics of mountaineering). We hiked down part of the way
together. They got me excited about climbing again for the health, puzzles
and variety it provides. I'm inspired! Check out their interesting [web site](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1).


### Wendelstein
_December, 2022_

I hiked up Wendenstein from Bayrischzell with snowshoes in my pack, unused.

### Wallberg
_December, 2022_

I hiked up Wallberg in boots.

### Kranzhorn
_December, 2022_

I hiked up Kranzhorn. Only snow in the upper reaches.

### Juffinger Jöchl and Großer Pölven
_November 27, 2022_

I hiked up and down. My boys birthday!
They are 18. Ah-mazing.

### Texel Peaks
_October 21, 2022_

Short visit to Südtirol. I love that place. First 1500 meters, then, according
to Google, a massive 2200 meter day. There were a lot of ups and downs, but
still, I'm going to discount that to 1800!

First day, a climb of the Hohe Kreuzspitze (2743 m) from the Schutzhütte Hochalm,
with a very friendly owner who told me stories of the region and his family.
I also climbed up the Hochwart (2608 m) on the way down, making for a big day.
It started raining on the descent, and I skipped out on a free yoga class at
the hut in order to get down and find a hotel in Meran.

After a rainy Saturday (very enjoyable, I got some work done), I headed up
early Sunday morening from Velloi to the Gasthaus Steinegg along the Hans Frieden Felsenweg,
then up and over to the Mutkopf (1664 m), and into the Spronsertal.
Some cake at the Oberkaseralm, then to the beautiful Mückenlack, the Grünsee
and the Langsee. From here over to the Hochgangscharte (2444 m), then very steeply down
that to the Schutzhaus Hochgang then for a beer at the very pleasant Leiteralm
above Velloi.

### Grosse Riesenkopf
_October 18, 2022_

A late-afternoon hike up this local peak.
I took a wrong turn on the way down, then had to creep through barbed-wire
fences at dusk. I heard a sound and looked up with some shock to see a
cow inquiring right in my face! She followed me across two fields, sometimes
running to keep up with me!

### Hike up the Vorderes Sonnwendjoch

More info to come.

Heading back down to the Inn valley.

### Bad Feilnbach long hike
_February 18, 2022_

I [made a tour on Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/675454148)
on a fantastic, windy day. I've been doing a lot of long, relatively
flat walks to toughen up my feet and legs for hiking the CDT.
It's been really important to increase the number of miles and
let go of my obsessive desire for elevation gain. The only way
to toughen up the feet is long mileage. Anyway, it was an incredibly
fun day. 18.3 miles in total, and about 1400 feet up and down.

A neat pond along the way.

An incredible "grotto" in which one can meditate on the glory of Mary.

A day of wind, of alert horses, of fast moving clouds, of rain
and sore feet, and a good "frischkäse" sandwich from the Edeka in Bad Feilnbach.

### Pletzachkogel and Roßkogel
_January 4, 2022_

Very interesting hike. Steeply up to a small (inhabited!) cabin
in a meadow with a Charlie-Brown-esque Christmas bush, then
on a steep road and trail to the Pletzachkogel summit. From
there over to a kind of abandoned ski area compound, and with
snowshoes steeply up to the high abandoned lift station.
I peered inside the windows of the adjoining hut to see a rack
of kettleballs and "WOD" (workout of the day) notations on a
chalkboard. It's some kind of revanchist "body kultur" hideout!

I'm only kidding -- seems really cool. Anyway, the final climb
to the summit of the Roßkogel was interesting. I scrambled up
a rocky ridgecrest with a rather difficult step. Meanwhile an
extremely agile man came bounding down the ridge and batmanned
through the latschen trees in an area of similar difficulty
20 meters to my left. In fact, I saw many people this day (8 or 10?).

Aside from the radio tower on the summit, it's a neat place.
There are likely no better viewpoints of Guffert.

1600 meters up and down.

Just above the steep road in the forest, we come out on the slopes
of Pletzachkogel.
