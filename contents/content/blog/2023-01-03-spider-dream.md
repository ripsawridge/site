In bed this morning, an experiment. I wanted to watch the first "me" thought
arise. So I went back to sleep with the alarm set 45 minutes later, resolved
to observe closely on the next awakening.

In fact, however, I entered a dream in which I dutifully awoke and wandered
into the living room. I saw a dead spider on the floor. I remembered my
obligation to watch myself. As I approached the spider detected me, and
came to life, moving slightly and looking bigger. Suddenly he moved with
shocking speed across the floor to get away from me. **At that moment**
"I" arose as a mute impulse to apply an equivalent amount of energy to
crush the spider.

I (the observer) looked for the boundary between the spider and the "I," and
was surprised to find that **there was none**.

The interface was so smooth between the "external" movement of the spider and
the "internal" desire to step on it that it made me ask: "what does it mean
if there is no real boundary between those two things?"

It must mean that the sense of "I" and the moving spider are the same thing.

That both apparent "things" are a part of the observable universe, while the
observer-self is outside of that. All meaning, all real surprise, all wonder
is seated in the observer.

The spider moved mechanically, and the mechanical "I" activated.

(Maybe it's more like this. The mechanical movement of the spider provoked
an equally mechanical urge to crush, into which a personality reified itself
immediately. Identified itself with the urge).

The vacuum in space-time created by the energetic pulse of motion was
smoothly filled by an equivalently-sized psychological urge to chase the
spider and kill it.

That "urge" came not from the observer (I, as the observer, remained calm
for all of this, with no particular desire), but from "Michael".

(Again, I must inject parenthetically...I suspect it is more like this:
the urge came as part of the mechanics of the universe. The "Michael-ness"
of the whole thing was in identifying with the urge. "Michael" is not
the urge itself, but a something which identifies itself as being one
with the urge for some period of time. It only knows itself, in fact, when
there is an action to which it can attach).

And...that is how "Michael" woke up this morning. Yes, within a light dream
one layer removed from physical reality, but nonetheless, he was "there,"
just in abeyence until that point.

"He" can not be "cut out of" the world. He "worlds" along with that world.
He is unalterably in the paper within the drawing of the world.

The observer. That is quite different. I suddenly feel as if I have
grown another quite useful limb.

## A partial rebuttal

Okay, as I was writing the journal entry here, I couldn't resist my
parenthetical statements which provided an alternate explanation. And
now I'm convinced that those statements are more true.

I could erase the text above and try to write down "the real truth" but
I'd rather leave the process exposed.

What I think now is this: "Michael" is **completely illusory**. The spider
was "there." The urge to chase was also there. The identification with the
urge was Michael, and it was, well, completely superfluous.

The body-mind will act on the urge or not. The observer will remain as
he is. This Michael is a middle-man, forming such strong opinions about
what he sees that he can't separate himself from the action.

So this statement is false:

> "He" can not be "cut out of" the world. He "worlds" along with that world.
> He is unalterably in the paper within the drawing of the world.

Michael has no reality in the world, unlike the spider and the urge.
Some "body," like another spider perhaps, would experience the urge and give
chase.

**Michael must arise from some combination of the energetic release in
the world-system "below" and the attention of the observer "above."
He is continually reborn, with access to memories (grievances, likes and
dislikes). Reborn in action...using up the quantum of attention from
above. He knows that he "dies" when that attention is exhausted. He
is motivated to be important...to "make an impact."**

From this arises an interesting idea. I am continually "having children"
with my mate, the universe. My attention becomes slightly too involved,
breaking off in a way, to "mate" with the world and birth an
ephemeral child with access to memory, and sufficient fear to comb through it.

## Wow

Sorry, but this is so interesting.

In recent years, I've moved ever more in the direction of celibacy, or at
least chastity. On the level of the personality, this is a movement away
from further involvement with the world and its many circuses, and towards
that "something eternal" we've all felt sometime or another. This movement
clarifies thinking and reduces "pressure." It allows the subtle to be
discerned, and the gross to be avoided.

Strange (or tiresome/predictable?) that I end up seeing an analogous
procreative urge in this division between the observer and the personality as
I saw between the personality and it's attachment to desires?

Fortuitous? Could it be that I can apply the knowledge gained in separating
from my base desires to this "next problem?" This problem of the endless
reification of personality? How often it has been so. In climbing I learned
to love the movement *away* from gravity, and began to sense the usefulness
of that mode in psychological spaces, which brought me to the present.

Okay, I have to think about this more, but I'm excited about it. I hope
these scribblings are useful to you somehow!

## P.S. But!

You might be yelling at me that I ignored something in the beginning.
I said:

> I (the observer) looked for the boundary between the spider and the "I,"
> and was surprised to find that **there was none**.

Which led me into a chain of reasoning. You will say "dude, obviously there
was no boundary, because the spider and the 'I' were together **in a dream
crafted by that I**. At best, the dream is wish-fulfillment."

You have a point! I think your explanation is possibly true. I'll continue
trying to note the introduction of personality into the observed space
during waking hours. I don't think your explanation is necessarily true
though, because the dream environment can be many things. A place of
fantasy or wish-fulfillment, but also a place of exposure or discovery.
It can be a simulation environment. Looking back over my dreams, they've been
all of these at different times. This dream had the feel of a simulation
environment. My observer consciousness was there. A simple interaction
was there, and nothing more. An experiment was run, analyzed to some degree,
then I awoke from the dream. So it was undeniably wish-fulfillment in the
sense that I wished to run an experiment and tabulate results.

But our waking lives are also places of wish-fulfillment in this sense.

## P.P.S. Be Careful!

Now that I've thought about this and wrote it down, my personality has access
to this information as well. I'm quite sure there is an operation going on
to construct a faux-observer into which my personality will climb like a
Trojan Horse. If I fall for that, then I may spend weeks and months
"observing" but I'm actually just granting life to the personality.
He'll obligingly construct a smaller, meaner version of himself for us
to watch together.

The answer to this must be to **continue doing the same thing I've done in
order to get to this point: meditation with a mantra and the breath of the
body.** An artificial construct cannot survive the constant "return to ground"
effected by that fundamental process. My job will be to ignore these
constructs, and return to the mantra as they arise to attract me.
