### Flintsbach
_May 20, 2014_

Great evening climbing session with Hannes. We quickly dispatched
Fliegenschiss (6-) and Steinlaus (6-), then an easier route to the right,
I think grade 5. Then we got on the 8- "sehr stickiges stehproblem,"
which Hannes did an amazing job on. We climbed the easy pitch above
with the 5+ chimney/crack. Then we climbed the route on the right side
of the crag, P1 only, grade 7-. Wonderful. We repeated it on TR.

Finally, as it got dark we climbed a 5+ route back right of
Fruechte der Saison.

### Wallberg
_May 18, 2014_

I hiked up for exercise with a 30 pound pack, content with making the lift
station instead of the true summit, so the gain was only 820 meters. Reasonably
fun despite the pack full of water and rocks! Again, plenty of fresh snow.
Will summer ever come?

### Kopfkraxen
_May 4, 2014_

I went for hike in my new climbing boots, to continue breaking them in and
maybe, if I was lucky, get to do a bit of rock climbing or scrambling.
Unfortunately, the weather took a turn for the worse, and I was alarmed to
see fresh snow down to a low level on the drive into the Wilder Kaiser.
I parked at the Jaegerwirt above Scheffau, and hiked up past the waterfall into the
Schneekar, now in deep but consolidated snow. A bit of misting rain turned
to snowflakes on the way up. I decided to climb the West Ridge (III) of
Sonneck, a summit I'd never visited. However I was turned around at about
2050 meters by insecure icy rocks in a steep gully. So I descended back
to the waterfall at about 1550 meters, and then dutifully up the snowy
trail to the summit of the Kopfkraxen at about 2130 meters. By now
it was pretty late (I think I started hiking at 2 pm), so I regretfully
decided not to continue on to the summit of Sonneck, which would have
required a snowy descent. I went down a different way into the
Kaiser Hochalm valley, then rather inefficiently along a grassy
spur above the Jaegerwirt, at some points leaving the road or trail
and following my nose in the gloaming. I think it was about 1700 meters
up and down. Here is a video:

### Plessenberg and Buchacker Alm
_April 26, 2014_

Whew, more exploration of the Brandenberger Alpen! I was back on the trail to
the Ascherjöchl, and this time I continued up to the Plessenberg summit. In
answer to a small prayer, the cloud obscuring the summit all the way up
disappeared as I approached. Yes! So I could see the Inntal and all around. I
tagged the Heuberg summit too, just for fun. Looks like this was about 1400
meters up and down.

Back down to the car, then I drove to a shady meadow to make some delicious
salami, Kaiser Max cheese and Dijon mustard sandwiches. After about an hour of
taking it easy, I was ready for the second hike.

Clocking in at about 890 meters up and down, I followed a road from Embach up to
the Buchacker Alm, making my high point a little hillock shortly after the
division of the Hundesalm and Buchacker Alm roads divide (also marked by a bench
on a small hill). That bench was occupied by a cheerful biker, so I continued a
bit further hoping for expansive views to the north (partially successful). This
is a very beautiful high Alm which has a very "in the sky" feeling because it's
not dominated by still-higher looming peaks. I think the road walk is a bit
unfortunate, but at least it's very steep. On the way down I took some trail
short-cuts, but my god, they were nearly vertical tree-roots at times.

So, grand total of 890 + 1400 = 2290 meters, or 7513 feet, whew! What a nice day.

### Voldöpper Spitze and Ascherjöchl
_April 13, 2014_

I wanted some snow-free hiking, but I didn't know how high I'd be able to get before the snow got
deep. Also it was going to rain. I decided to do two 1000 meter hikes in order to get plenty of
exercise. I chose the Voldöpper Spitze above Kramsach, parking near a campground, and just hiking
up and down without even a pack or water, just an iPod. Mostly it didn't rain, and the summit
was nice, popping steeply out of the trees for decent local views. I returned the same way, for
about 3 hours round trip.

For my next hike, I looked at OruxMaps in my phone to see where to go next. To the east there was
a mountain called Heuberg. I didn't know if I could really do another 1000 meters, but I realized
I could make the Ascherjöchl my goal, and that would be around 800 meters. The hike up to Ascherjöchl
from Grub was hilariously steep on something like a wagon road for the first half. It started to
rain heavily but luckily I came to a small meadow carved out of the dense forest with a few houses
with covered porches. I rested a while and continued on steep and muddy trail that was tricky to
get down without slipping. At the pass there were good views and occasional sun. I wandered around
above the pass, settling for a rest on a 1500 meter hillside looking across to Heuberg.

These peaks were lonely mountains for the _Einheimische_ of the [Brandenburger Mountains](http://www.summitpost.org/brandenberger-alpen/602522).

### Rossstein and Buchstein
_April 4, 2014_

Hiked up Rossstein and Buchstein in heavy rain. I loved my trusty umbrella. The rain let up when I
had to use my hands for the scrambling, but the rocks were quite slick. The Tegernseehuette is
closed. Up and down in 2:45, 900 meters gain/loss.

### Wallberg
_March 23, 2014_

Riki and I hiked up Wallberg in a hilarious driving snow-storm. We were thinking those days are over
in this short and strange winter. Lots of trailbreaking on the road when it comes out of the forest.
The summit was a cloudy experience. Good times!

### 2 days with Timo

Timo and I skied up the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel in the Sellrein. Fun day! We broke trail for the first two-thirds
of the route, then stronger people came! Beautiful deep powder. We stayed in Gries that evening with a nice old
fellow. The next day we climbed the Bafflfall, good fun, then went to the Martinswand to climb the via ferrata.
I got freaked out with my slippery gloves, and ended up on a hiking adventure in the forest on the left side of
the Martinswand, following game trails up cliffs and steep forest. By the time I got back, Timo was waiting at
his van, like, "what happened to you?" Oh well, it all worked out on this nice day.

### Heimgarten
<i>February 15, 2014</i>

Fun, short hike. 1200 meters up and down. Movie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT3lh4dmPvM). And

### Bischof and Hoher Fricken
<i>February 8, 2014</i>

Super snowshoe hike, with an especially spicy hike down the Kuhflucht trail. Really nice day out.

### Hochblassen and Ochsenaelpelekopf
<i>Feb. 2, 2014</i>

A great snowshoe hike today up Hochblassen, and then to the Ochsenaelpelekopf on
the other side of the valley. I ate lunch by the Jaeger Huette, watching the
snow come down pretty hard. It was a day of clouds and snow on and off. No views
from either summit. Fun anyway. 1400 meters up/down from the Ammerwald Hotel.

### Friederspitze
<i>January 18, 2014</i>

Snowshoe hike up Friderspitze. 1250 meters up/down.

### Forgot the name
<i>January, 2014</i>

Ski up a peak in the Sellrain with Josef, unfortunately ran out of time (and shape!), so didn't make the summit. About 1000 meters up/down.
