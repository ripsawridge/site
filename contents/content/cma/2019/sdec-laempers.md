### L채mpersberg

_December 29, 2019_

Extremely beautiful out here. Gorgeous powder snow.
One annoying fall where my ski came off and slid about 50 meters down the
mountain...denying me some sweet turns (I'm poor at skiing on one ski,
must somehow improve).

The way up the mountain wasn't in the book I was using. I just followed
the crowd. I parked on the north side of a lake. There was a fantastic
and photogenic steep ridge crest that somehow held a skin track.

Guys at the top suggested I go down the south side, but I was quite
enomoured of the country I came up. Nah. I'll go down the same way.
Fresh, deep snow like this under a blue sky...it was what I needed.
1200 meters up/down.
