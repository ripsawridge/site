Vaclav and I climbed the Riegelekante (V+) on the south face of the
Östliche Hochgrubachspitze. It was fantastic, despite rather a lot of clouds on
the way up. Here is the story.


We hiked up in mist, which began to clear at the Ackerlhütte.

Our mountain is on the right side of the picture, and the approach was pretty
involved. We had to exit a trail that climbed into steep grassy slopes underneath
the two Hochgrubachspitze summits, following a faint game path to the east.
The scale of this face and the steepness of it was kind of awesome.
We found the right place to head up, scrambling on grade II and occasional
steps of III- or so, wondering if we'd need to get the rope out before
we reached the climb!

But moving slowly, it all went okay. Soon we stood at the base of the climb.
It was about 11:15, and we were hanging out at the hut around 8:45, so that says
something about how involved it is. We were often in clouds, and were exceptionally
careful to make good decisions about routefinding, being aware that in such
conditions it would be easy to end up in the wrong place.

I climbed the wrong way right at the start, and had to retrieve gear and downclimb
about 15 meters. Going back up I reached a bolt at an overhang, passed on the left
side to easier terrain. We continued for several pitches, with clouds coming in
and out. I had the impression from somewhere that the route was mostly bolted, but
boy, that's not the case! I'm glad for the three cams and many long slings that I
brought (I left the nuts at home). Every pitch required gear placements. But that
was awesome!

Gradually we got a sense of climbing a great hogsback, which undulated in humps
below us. Vaclav did a great job following pitches, retrieving gear, making jokes
all the while. He climbed quickly, too. We were glad we had our jackets...it
was pretty cold when the wind blew, especially.

Finally we were at a fantastic perch below the crux 7th pitch. I tightened up my
shoes, ate something, then started up. The first 6 meters have no protection, though 
it's pretty steep. I was happy to reach the bolt. The climbing was on small holds
and edges for the whole pitch, and well protected with a couple more bolts and a
fixed pin after the first bolt. Whew! Enjoyable and not easy ("nicht ohne" is a nice
German phrase for this situation).

We coiled the rope to walk about 60 meters up to the last pitch, which was easier than
the rating (IV) suggested. I put the rope around a block on the summit and belayed
Vaclav up with a normal belay, then a hip belay for the last scrambling meters.
The south was in clouds, but there was a heavenly view into the little valley
with the Fritz-Pflaume-Hütte to the north, with gorgeous green mountains stretching out
beyond.

We put the rope away and scrambled down to the notch with the Westliche Hochgrubachspitze,
then climbed up slightly right of the notch proper. We climbed this summit, then
backtracked a bit and hunted around for the trail down, finding it over a little
scrambling notch. The waz down, marked bz red dots was a long and excellent trail,
often astoundingly steep...think vertical grass hummocks, and hold-rich rocky buttresses
and chimneys. We reached our backpack at the place where we'd left the trail in the
morning.

And down, down, down, to the Ackerlhütte, then retracing our steps to the car. It was
about 1400 meters up and down, 9 pitches (4, 4+, 3, 4-, 4-, 4, 5+, 1, 4-). Thanks
Vaclav for the great climbing! More pictures [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/albums/72157701193960045).
