Eight o'clock on New Year's morning, I was alone in the parking lot, getting
ready. A man shoveled snow at a nearby inn and watched me from across a
snowbank. I had 2 pairs of gloves, a wind jacket, two fleece layers, and
the warm hat Kris made for me. I had a shovel, an avalanche beacon with
fresh batteries, and an avalanche probe. A map, a cell phone, some goggles,
a camera, a hot thermos of tea, some cookies and an iPod with the riveting
audiobook "Unbroken."

Skins on skis, then I left, into a cold blue valley. It hadn't snowed
in a while, and this was "the most popular ski tour in Tyrol," according
to my guidebook, so there was a good track to follow. I'd been here two
years before with Daniel A., but we turned around because of unstable snow
slabs that made us nervous. There shouldn't be any problem today.
  
  
For a long time I was lost in thought with the story I was listening to.
Louie Zamperini competed in the 1936 Olympics, survived deadly bombing
missions in the Pacific, survived for more than 30 days in an inflatable
raft with no food, drifting over 2000 miles, only to become a Japanese
prisoner of war. I couldn't believe the hardships endured or the determination
to overcome.
  
  
Conditions were much better than when Daniel and I were here before. I
entered an exciting upland plateau, with a frozen lake below on my right.
One more plateau lay above the Kraspesferner Glacier, which I dutifully
switchbacked up. Finally I was in the sun! It was time to take pictures,
but to my sadness I realized that both batteries were nearly dead, partially
because of the cold. I managed to snap a few. For the summit my trusty
iPod Nano's video camera came into service. It's not a great shot, but
it conveys some of the wild winter in the Stubai. It was a rare pleasure
to be complately alone.
  
  
I started down, skiing cautiously as it's the first time since last year.
That always bugs me that the first time I ski in a year is high on a wilderness
mountain, when the consequences of an accident are highly unpleasant! Maybe
I should become mature and visit a ski area once first!
  
  
But the skiing wasn't hard, and before I knew it I was sliding down the
Kraspes Glacier, and seeing people. 4 or 5 late risers were coming up.
One man decided not to go to the summit, and started down, skiing very
well. Where the slope flattened he lost his bearing in the deep snow and
crashed spectacularly! He was laughing so I, the single member of the audience,
whooped and clapped.
  
  
Later, I think I crashed in the same place.
  
  
I skied further, resorting to "side-slipping" a steep slope above a raging
creek because I didn't like the possibility of falling there. It looked
like others had done the same, as the fresh powder snow was mostly scrubbed
away, leaving hard snow with a few twigs sticking out. Faint humps showed
where a few brave souls made turns.
  
  
"That was fun!" I said to no one in particular, back at the car. I drove
a few minutes down to Gries im Sellrain and found a room plus breakfast.
I spent some time making the room homey, took a nap, then went out to dinner.
I had two non-alcoholic beers (weird, I know), and the menu of the night,
which was a pork steak with pasta and cheese. All I'd eaten during the
day was a few cookies, so I planned to order a big dessert but I was too
full. I'd been to this restaurant before, with Josef who is a vegetarian.
I remember he had a terrible time trying to cobble together a meatless
dinner. Looking at the menu now though, I noticed there was an actually
vegetarian section...so next time would be easier!

After dinner I walked through the cemetary, which was lit up with little
red lamps on most of the graves. The hulking mountains around were only
sensed by the absence of stars in blackened regions of the sky. After some
more walking, I turned in.
  
  
Sunday dawned rather grey. I'd awakened a few times at night to make notes
on a horrific story idea called "Tea Party Nation." :D. I had all these
archetypes, like The Judge, the Welfare Queen, the Pundit, and how they
would fare under a massive political change in the U.S.. Often not how
you'd expect.
  
  
At breakfast I talked with a couple, and they recognized me from my car!
The husband had seen my car parked in the Munich climbing gym several times.
So we started talking about climbing. He told me two stories of the great
Hermann Buhl, widely considered the greatest climber of all time in Tyrol.
One, that he worked at the big Schuschter outdoor store in Munich during
the 1950s, occasionally swiping gear. But everyone loved him so they didn't
mind. Herr Schuschter used his considerable funds to make sure Hermann
got on the Nanga Parbat expedition that would make him famous. He threatened
to withhold funds and gear, making the expedition pay full price for it
all if Hermann didn't go. Of course, we know it was the first ascent of
an 8000'er without oxygen. Solo, and with an exposed bivouac above 8000
meters.
  
  
I told the man that my favorite Buhl story was when he rode his bike from
Innsbruck to Piz Badille, soloed the North Face (a 5.10 rock route in modern
terms, but much snowier/icier in the past), then rode home. We talked more
about climbing and said goodbye.
  
  
A few minutes later I was in Luesens, getting ready to ski amid a bevy
of ice climbers. I headed up, alone again, to the slopes west of the small
cluster of buildings that make up town. One short but steep slope seemed
to take forever because the skin track had been blasted into oblivion by
descending skiers. There was a lot of traversing and trying to ascend here
or there.
  
  
Despite the great weather forecast, I entered a thick, dark cloud, and
was soon covered in snowflakes. I put on a jacket and kept going in the
flat light and pea soup that made it hard to see more than a few feet.
This would be "fun" coming down! A couple of guys caught up to me while
I drank some tea. They were from Bolzano. I asked if they knew Daniel B.,
but they didn't. We exchanged notes on good Dolomiti climbs. They had done
the Comici on the Grosse Zinne in September. The crux pitch had very, very
small handholds, they said. I told them about how Jesse and I sat below
it for an hour, with a queue of people above us not moving, and abseiled
off. Next time then!
  
  
I continued in the lead, aiming for a patch of blue sky. Visibility improved
and I reveled in the beauty of the area. Higher, many tracks diverged to
a subsidiary summit on the right. I looked at the map and was sure the
Schoentalspitze was on the left. Snow there was sparser, and it looked
like you'd just have to stop skiing halfway up a broad slope because too
many rocks were sticking out. I cared more about the summit than skiing,
so I headed that way, along with the others.
  
  
We skinned halfway up the slope and left the skis, then continued in boots
to the summit. This time we were barely above a boiling array of clouds,
swirling in rough congress with the nearby peaks. The sun felt nice. It
seems to be typical for January skiing that you only see the sun at the
summit, because southern slopes often don't have enough snow to make skiing
fun. So you sneak up the mountain by wind-protected northerly slopes. A
quick peek over a ridge gives you a bit of warm sun, then it's back to
the shadow.
  
  
I coaxed a few pictures out of the camera, thanks to keeping the batteries
warm by my chest. Skiing down, I soon entered the cloud. Two guys were
ahead of me and I used them to orient myself. By keeping one of them just
visible, I could ski better because I could recognize the approximate angle
of the slope. Had I been alone I would have gone very slowly indeed! There
was no indicator of the angle ahead of you, and it was even hard to see
cut up tracks in the snow left by those ahead. The best sense was feel.
I could feel the undulating layers of compact and fresh snow beneath me,
and that way I knew I was on track. The whoosh of gravity was a warning
to turn!
  
  
Finally they skiied off to the north, a different way than the way I'd
come. But I was stranded on a slope that dropped off into scraggly trees.
I'd missed my turn off. Rather than climb up, I tried to ski the slope.
It worked, mostly. Some scraping along and grabbing of little branches,
then I was on a road. I went northeast, to follow the two helpful skiers.
A combination of road and skied-out slopes got me back to the village.
  
  
Another great skiing day! It was snowing heavily down here, and I decided
not to go "ice bouldering," though I did see some people on Gasthausfall
as I drove away. I saw terrible traffic jams between Innsbruck and Woergl,
and was happy to go the opposite way. That is, until I entered one. It
took about an hour to get to Kufstein, where I decided to get off and eat
dinner.
  
  
I hiked up to the fortress to get a few of the mountains around, mostly
hidden in cloud. My mission now was to explore Kufstein to it's limit!
I found a bunch of historical plaques and read them all! I discovered that
until the 19th century riverine travel was the way to go. It took half
a day to raft from Innsbruck to Kufstein, but 5 days to go the opposite
direction! They had a team of draft horses on the bank to pull the boat
upstream. Whew. Kufstein was a border town for a long time. Germans would
come, show their papers, and go drinking in the bars. Apparently musical
competitions were a specialty. It seemed like the town spent the 18th century
rebuilding from rubble when the Bavarians attacked in 1703\. Just as they
finished, the Bavarians (as part of Napoleons Army) attacked again. Ey
yi yi...
  
  
The oldest record of human habitation in Tyrol was found in caves nearby.
Tools and spears, 30,000 years old. The town was a Roman garrison, and
later an important strategic location in the Middle Ages. It earned the
right to build protective walls.
  
  
Oh, the sewing machine was invented here.
  
  
So it went on like that for hours. I found a restaruant with wi-fi, and
watched the enormous traffic jam slowly unlock. Finally around 7:30 the
roads were pretty clear, and I drove home.
  
  
Stats: The peaks had 1450, and 1400 meters elevation gain. I climbed them
each in something under 4 hours, and the ski down was always quick (like
an hour or less).
