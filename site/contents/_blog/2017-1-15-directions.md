I'd like to explain how to make an intelligent guess about where
north, south, east and west are. It's more useful than you think.
If you are driving in a city, you can imagine the map in your head and orient
yourself much better if you have a rough idea about the points of the
compass.

* Never (North) - 12 o'clock
* Eat (East) - 3 o'clock
* Sour (South) - 6 o'clock
* Watermelons! (West) - 9 o'clock

Remember that well. Now, practice orienting yourself as if you're standing on
the ground and say, south is right in front of you. Which way would you turn
to go west?

Left, of course. What if you should then turn north after walking west
for a while? Well, turn left again. Now you should go south one more time.
What to do? Turn directly around and face the other way.

Try this everywhere. Soon you'll feel much better if you **simply know
one of the directions.** All you need is one! The rest follow from it.
Extend this to other things you know. For example, in the city of
Munich, Germany, Prinzregentenstrasse runs east / west. If it's evening,
and you are driving along it, and the sun is in your eyes, then you are traveling
west. If you have a dinner appointment in the Schwabing neighborhood,
and you find yourself making a **left turn** off of Prinzregentenstrasse, then
clearly something is wrong! You would be heading south...and imagining a
map of Munich in your head, it becomes clear that Schwabing is a bit to the
north of your street. And therefore...

You should be making a **right turn** off of this street.

Practice this exercise enough and a sense of direction will become a part of
your background task. People will think of you as someone who has a good "feel"
for orientation. No: it's because you did the work.

## Guessing the compass points from "nothing"

There are a few "magic" tricks you can apply. In the morning, the sun rises in the
east. It sets in the west. So you can orient yourself in the morning and evening.
But what about in the middle hours of the day?

In summer, it's hard to tell. But in the European or North American winter, it's made
easier by the fact that the sun is arcing across the **southern** sky. At noon in
January in Munich (same goes for Portland, Oregon), the sun never really attains the
"top" of the sky: it is still rather weak, and when you face it you will be looking
generally to the south.

It follows then, that if the afternoon is wearing on, the sun is to the **right**
of south, so you should turn a bit **left** if you want to face south. If it's still morning then
the sun is to the **left** of south, so you should turn a bit **right** if you
want to face south. Remember: you only need one point of the compass and the
rest follow from that!

There are other tricks. In a natural landscape, north slopes are shady and they'll have
snow much earlier in the fall and later in the spring than southern slopes.
At lower elevations in the mountains, northern slopes will probably have more
trees. At higher elevations, they'll have less than southern slopes. Generally, the
mountain slopes are steeper on the north because long-dead glaciers carved and
dug out those slopes. When you think of interesting and dramatic mountain slopes, you
are thinking of northern slopes.

Guessing your direction is fun! Set up little tests and try it. It doesn't have to be
perfect. If you can hazily guess that south is anywhere within a general "region"
then you are probably doing okay. Have fun!
