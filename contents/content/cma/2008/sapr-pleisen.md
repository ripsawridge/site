### Pleisenspitze ski
_April, 2008_

I had the morning free so I went for a ski up the Pleisenspitze.

Snow was absent at the trailhead, but after about a mile of walking I could
start skinning up. Lots of icy dirt road skiing, then I reached the hut where
the view became incredible. It was still early, and it hadn't snowed in a long
time, so the conditions up on the summit ridge were terribly icy. I wished for
ski crampons. Finally, I had to take off my skis and kick steps up moderate but
super icy slopes. Really irritating! But the weather was amazing, all the
Karwendel peaks were out. I had a companion, "Flat Lexi," and I showed her the
view on the summit.

*Flat Lexi wanted to see the mountains, so our Daddy took her on a ski
expedition. They skied UP the mountain. Here is Flat Lexi near the summit. The
mountain is called the Pleisenspitze.*

*It was a beautiful day on the Pleisenspitze. Flat Lexi is standing in Germany,
but the mountains behind her are in another country! They are in Austria.*

*Daddy likes to listen to music when he skis up a mountain. Flat Lexi wanted to
listen too, but the headphones didn't fit her.*

*It was so windy on the summit, Daddy and Flat Lexi could barely stand up! But
Daddy said Flat Lexi thought it was beautiful there.*

*Do you see the white snow down in the valley? That's the town where Daddy
parked the car. Flat Lexi is thinking about how much warmer it is down there!*

*Flat Lexi is really tired. She took a nap once they got below the snow line and
it was warm. Daddy had to watch her and make sure the wind didn't take her
away!*

*"I like this place," said Flat Lexi. She said she could play in the meadow
beneath the mountains all day long. But it was time to go home. Flat Lexi says
she'll be back for more mountains some day!*

I was worried about the steepness on the way down, but it was great skiing. It
was "firn" snow, much like a ski piste, and I felt really great. I loved the
deeper snow near the hut, picking my own line through little trees.

But then the hell! The skiing on the road was just awful. Icy, terrifying
tracks. I actually fell off the road one time and had to catch myself from
going over a cliff! Oh brother. Later I left the road for even worse breakable
crust in the forest. Oh man, the curses were flying! But finally I was down,
and going home around noon.
