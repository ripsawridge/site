## Note One: "Incels"

I saw a riveting clip from this interview last week. When Jordan Peterson
displays emotion, I am transfixed. My data ports are open, and I'm thinking:
this is how a man is usefully scraped to the core. He gives up none of
his strength. No, the emotion he feels now is **deepening** his commitment
to his chosen ideals. In this case, he's feeling empathy for the "incel
men" a Hollywood actress is bashing. As a clinician and speaker, he's been
told over and over by these men that he gave them the tools to wrest meaning
from a life that felt meaningless.

His emotion comes from **deep experience** and the manly requirement to
fight for the honor of those who came to him. We have all felt bereft of
meaning, and been called names by the dominant culture for it. We've all
been the incel men, even and perhaps especially, the ones who hurl the
insult today.

A man who sheds tears for these men sheds tears for us all at our lowest.
And importantly, the tears produce **useful work**. They **strengthen resolve.**
And so, we all are rescued.

Here is the clip:

And here is a clip of Matt Walsh talking about it. He exposes the casual
hypocrisy of the modern left, and in particular, their demand that men
"show vulnerability," yet when they do, they are scorned. Matt Walsh is very
good at heightening these contrasts and exposing their illogic. I fully expect
to have to replace this video with a copy I saved because these days, the
left controls the tech platforms as well as the government, and I'm no longer
surprised when such things disappear. The words of Ben Kenobi come to mind
though, here.

As he says, "those were tears of **empathy**, not **self-pity**.

The whole interview is good. All of this strengthens my resolve to
**speak up** and fight back. Evil triumphs when **good men do nothing**.

## Note Two: "Why do modern women see toxic masculinity everywhere?"

Because they carry it **inside themselves**. From the interview with Piers
Morgen, again, I think Peterson gave the most succinct explanation I've
heard of the problem. I'm writing it down because it's more important than
transitory
video ([nonetheless here is the timestamped location](https://youtu.be/lpnvGA-wJIE?t=1444)):

**Morgan**: You believe that most women probably like for their men to be strong
and confident.

**Peterson**: I don't *believe* that, all that data shows that, clearly, and
has for 50 years.

**Morgan**: Right, and most women I know would agree. So why is it that you've
been so vilified for suggesting something which is so palpably true?

**Peterson**: Well, first of all [because] it annoys narcissistic women to
no end, and it annoys people who think that there are no biological or
cultural limits on how we manifest our behaviors, and...it **frightens** a
large number of women because many women have never had a good relationship
with anyone masculine in their life. So the notion that they would need to
establish a trusting relationship with a man, and especially if he's in
something resembling a super-ordinate position (which is [BTW] what they
might like to have in order to find him maximally attractive) also implies
that in some sense they're going to be under his sway. If there's no trust
there, then that's absolutely terrifying. And, I have some sympathy for that
because there *are* no shortage of women out there who never had a positive
relationship with anyone masculine. And so they're completely **unable to
discriminate** between **narcisstic power and compulsion** and **confident
competence**. And so because they can't distinguish that, and they're afraid,
they put all of that in the same category which is something like this:
[Peterson brings his two hands together, where each hand represented
those polar opposites] **the predator category**.

As far as I'm concerned, this sums up the **deep suspicion of anything
masculine** that I've seen in the eyes of women in my cohort and older.
Those women are the ones waging war on families and couples. They are the
ones playing the snake to the Eve of a young women on the phone, always
supporting her negative comments about her husband, and never her
positive comments. They want to destroy men, and by golly, they've had a
great run.

They made a mush out of me, for example (of course: I let them, so they don't
get all the blame). Raised by a feminist mother and sisters, I apologized
for everything male and came to fear the masculine as much as they did.

The end result was to make me weak and at the mercy of my desires and fears,
just as they were. For in destroying the masculine, they also **destroyed the
masculine side of themselves**, which is that side tasked with
**ordering the household of the self**. This requires the acceptance of
hierarchy (*eww!*), the denigration of incompetence (*how cruel!*), the
awarding of more resources to the competent parts of the self, and the
taking away of resources from the craven parts (*how smug!*).

I've paid for listening to incompetent voices, and very much want that other
young men don't walk my road. If they start out strong, then they'll more
rapidly build stable and loving homes for their families.

Time is short! This life is only an in breath and an out breath in the
vast scheme.

Wherever you feel *guilt*, wherever you feel *fear*, wherever you feel *anger*.
There are devils hiding. Go into those places and slay the beasts you find.
