Lately I've really been into the TeX, LaTeX and ConTeXt typesetting systems.
I have some book ideas, and also I want to archive my trip reports in print
form, removing most of them from my web site too (yikes! I hear one guy
say :D).
  
  
Anyway, I liked this interview with the great Knuth that I found while
browsing the TUGBoat archives: [Donald Knuth, University of Oslo, 30 August 2002](http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb23-3-4/tb75knuth.pdf).
