### Bad Feilnbach long hike
_February 18, 2022_

I [made a tour on Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/675454148)
on a fantastic, windy day. I've been doing a lot of long, relatively
flat walks to toughen up my feet and legs for hiking the CDT.
It's been really important to increase the number of miles and
let go of my obsessive desire for elevation gain. The only way
to toughen up the feet is long mileage. Anyway, it was an incredibly
fun day. 18.3 miles in total, and about 1400 feet up and down.

A neat pond along the way.

An incredible "grotto" in which one can meditate on the glory of Mary.

A day of wind, of alert horses, of fast moving clouds, of rain
and sore feet, and a good "frischk√§se" sandwich from the Edeka in Bad Feilnbach.
