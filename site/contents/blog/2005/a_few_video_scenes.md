Well, tomorrow I fly to Seattle and then Hawaii to be reunited with my
greatly missed little family! Can't wait. Also, get to visit with a triumphant
Aidan fresh from trekking in Nepal. He said he'd teach me how to surf :-).
  
  
This weekend I was in Garmisch with Mat and Ari. We had a great time,
hiking through the amazing Partnachklamm, a deep gorge with a trail on
the side. The fresh snow on the rock made the dramatic landscape look like
something from _Halo_. I took some small movies with my cheap digital
camera, and combined them with some other movies from the Klettersteigs
the weekend before to make: [this](http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2005/germany_med.wmv).
It is a 12 MB movie, might be best to download it first. Scenes of landscapes,
Mat and Ari.
  
  
One of the coolest things we did was go swimming at the Zugspitze Bad.
It was a great swimming pool, also had a hot tub the size of many ordinary
swimming pools!
