It was the most relaxed of trips. I guess that makes sense. When you are "geared up" physically and mentally for a struggle a thin layer of paranoia and heightened sensitivity protects you. I can say I'm proud of every time I backed off something like that due to a bad feeling. Happily it wasn't all the time! 

I'd done a full round of climbs earlier in the summer and planned to stay home
most of August. But Danno and I had one day to climb together and the chance
couldn't be missed. He hadn't been out at all this year so we sought something
easy. We decided on a somewhat obscure route on the Langkofeleck. As the name
implies, it's a "corner" of the Langkofel, the furthest left side of that
amazing bulk when seen from the Sella Pass. The "Ramp Route," well named,
reaches the summit in 17 pitches with lots of easy ground, and difficulties to
IV+ (about 5.6 YDS). We awoke early and drove away from our secret bivy site,
munching on apples. The hike in took less than an hour, and we were very
surprised to see two guys reach the base right when we did.

"I thought this was an obscure route!" I said.

"What, on a day like today?" said the other guy, holding his arms in the air and gesturing.

Danno figured out what was wrong, he was listening more closely to what they
said. Turns out they wanted the famous Nordkante route of the Langkofel, way
over on the right side of the massif. That explains it! I gave them directions,
and they set off a little disheartened to have to climb down and back up
somewhere else. I silently wished them well, remembering how much I enjoyed that
route some years ago. I've promised to climb it again with Danno, and look
forward to that day.

I would lead the whole climb, and started out in a rather uninspiring loose
grade IV chimney. The next pitch offered some interesting moves, and soon we
gained the "ramp," which leads for a few hundred meters up and left to steep
towers. We traveled in coils for about 5 easy pitches, making a couple of quick
belays here and there. The ground steepened at a gray wall where a horizontal
seam splits the mountain for a hundred meters in either direction. This was a
great rock climbing pitch, probably the first of the day! Steep and solid, with
decent protection. We climbed up into a gully then traversed right on a ledge to
a somewhat intimidating chimney. But it's bark was bigger than it's bite. Nice
stemming between walls, then we sat down for a sandwich and looked out at the
Boe massif and the Sella Towers already far below. What a great place to be!

I hastened us on, as we were climbing up into a cloud that darkened the
mood. First we simul-climbed up a gully then for several confusing pitches up an
easy but indistinct face. I was proud at the end of these pitches to have kept
the route. Overall, there were few signs of passage. I think we'd seen about 5
pitons total on the climb, always at belay points, and we never saw any
intermediate fixed protection. I was thinking how neat this was, and that this
forgotten route with guaranteed solitude deserved a special place in memory...a
place to come back to.

We entered the last portion of the climb, a spectacular traversal of a narrow ridge crest that goes up and back down to a point below the summit block. In blowing clouds we got a glimpse of the final obstacle, a dark and dreary-looking chimney. The guidebook said it was "often wet" and in case of bad weather could be icy. We saw fresh snow in the tortured gullies on either side of our ridge and wondered what we would find. The chimney is the crux of the route. "It's just two 20 meter pitches," I said, sure that we would find a way through.

After the chimney we would walk 50 meters to the summit and enjoy a relatively moderate descent by local standards, certainly much shorter than that required by a climb of the main Langkofel summit. With these happy thoughts Danno put me on belay at the base of the chimney and I started up.

Only to go nowhere. I was immediately intimidated by the surroundings. High
above in a bomb-bay configuration a 3 meter long fixed rope hung with a knot in
the end of it. It had been placed there to help get through an often icy
section, I guessed. Danno and I talked about the topo and looked at the walls
around. It looked a bit easier on the right side of the chimney, more on the
face, but that might strand you somewhere. I found a piton a ways up, then made
a decision to go left and up a hand-crack with a fixed cam at the base. This
would lead me to the fixed rope above. I couldn't understand how I would get
through that section, but I trusted it would work. It's only 5.6, I thought!

<i>The accident site, in the darkest part of the chimney.</i>

An accident is just a progressive narrowing of options. Whether self-imposed or
brought by external forces, backdoors, retreats and alternatives vanish like
doors swiftly closing with a click. The hand crack was dripping icy water. I
decided to put on gloves, and tested to make sure I could jam well with them. I
could, so I made some moves, which immediately felt like 5.7 or 5.8. After about
10 feet my fingers were frozen and I needed some gear. It was difficult to
fumble for cams with the gloves on so I took one off and held it between my
teeth. Then I took the other one off and stuffed it in the crack. I was tiring
rapidly. It wasn't apparent to me below, but it seemed that the crack was
overhanging. The fixed rope was still a few moves above.

I needed to think about what I was doing and where I was. Before it's too late!

None of the gear would fit. The jams were good because the lip of the crack
pinched down to a good size, but the walls inside were flaring. No good for nuts
or cams. I thought about climbing down but discarded the idea (too quickly, I
think now). Finally, I found a chockstone in the crack that seemed solid. Often
these are the best anchors on a chimney pitch. This one wasn't absolutely
perfect though. I held onto it and tested it in various ways...but I was out of
time, I needed to get a sling around it and rest soon.

With turgid fingers barely working I got a Dyneema sling around it and asked
Danno to take the rope. He did. I may have started to complain about the
difficulties I faced, but my attention was soon distracted when the rope slipped
a bit. I looked up and saw the sling had bunched up on the left side of the
chockstone. Before I could finish the thought that something was wrong about
that a mighty crack! sounded and the chockstone flew out of the crack. I was
falling, wondering what would happen. I slammed into something and knew no more.

* * *

I came too half sitting on a ledge with my weight held uncomfortably by the
rope. I heard Danno talking on his phone. I didn't know what the fuss was
about. It was a curious sensation to know that you were climbing (because of the
obvious gear around), but have no memory of where you are or how you got
there. But eventually I saw my hand...my palm was a bloody mess that looked more
like a steak than anything human. It didn't hurt though, contributing to the
dreamlike atmosphere. I guessed Danno was calling for a rescue, which, to my
addled brain seemed like overreaction. I really wanted to get to him. My knee
was banged up somehow, but I was mentally together enough to ask if he had the
half-way marker in the rope. If he did, then he would have enough rope to lower
me to him. Leaving bloodstains on the walls, I asked for some slack and shuffled
over to the piton I'd found earlier. At that moment the helicopter
appeared. They signaled to me, asking if I could go down to Danno. I said yes,
he said no. The pilot kind of shrugged and flew away.

"I can definitely reach you Danno, just lower me. The rope is through a fixed
cam that caught me and it looks solid." Slowly the memory of falling was coming
back. I was worried about my mental state, I knew I'd been hit in the head
somehow. But the fact that I remembered the technical details about how to
safely lower comforted me that I was basically sane. My gloves had fallen with
me, and I was shivering. Danno told me to put on my jacket and I did, and then I
sorrowfully pulled a glove over my wounded hand, putting a dark cloud of worry
out of my mind.

Danno lowered me on the rope. I felt much better to be standing with him. We
heard shouts from above and moments later a man and woman in rescue gear
abseiled down to us. They were very nice, giving me a quick once over for hidden
wounds. The man climbed a few meters out onto the ridge we'd used to approach
the chimney, then sent Danno and I over on my rope which had been repurposed as
a fixed line. A moment later the helicopter appeared. The woman attached me to
her harness with one of my slings girth-hitched through my harness (it made me a
little nervous that my own gear became integral to the rescue operation!). The
cable came down, she clipped in and unclipped the anchor (a sling around a
rock), and we were up in the air. I was too uncomfortable to enjoy the view very
much due to a broken rib, but it was certainly fantastic. Overall though, I was
sad to be in this situation, a bit worried about my hand and everything that
comes after. Once safely in the helicopter I cried. I experienced a swirl of
emotions...sorrow, remorse, gratitude. Danno stayed close to me and the feeling
of safety I got from everyone was very helpful.

Danno was dropped off at the car, promising to find me at the hospital. We flew
on to Brixen, and I limped out to lay down on a stretcher. Then it was hours of
xrays, ultrasound, discussions taking place around me and I grew sleepy. I
shivered for hours despite a blanket on me. Gradually my hand started to
throb. In the worst moment, a doctor injected my hand 5 times with a numbing
agent. It was by far the most excruciating event of the day. Again and
again...ow!

They kept me overnight because of the head injury. I was finally able to call
home and talk to Kris around 7 or 8. I was making noises about quitting climbing
forever and she shut me up real quick. Basically, her idea was that the system
worked. Something went wrong (and I would continue to gnaw on what I could have
done better), control was lost, and the systems came into play. The total health
damage was a broken rib, a hand with many stitches in the palm, a bump on the
head and a bruised knee. This was, from my point of view, a very lucky
break. I'd call it minimal. Now, a few weeks later, the stitches are out and I'm
able to hike and run a little bit. Climbing will have to wait a month or so.

Danno came to chat a while, then I slept, chatting with my roommates a bit, they
were nice guys. We finally got away around noon Sunday, driving back north to
Munich. I particularly enjoyed a fantasy conversation about how we would have
gotten down if we didn't have access to mountain rescue services. We decided we
could have done it, though we might have been benighted near the bottom. There
would be some elevated risk for Danno, as he would probably end up climbing down
much "easy" ground unsecured by rope. I could be lowered down technical pitches
and climb down the ocean of moderate terrain with some difficulty. The problems
of shock and eventual pain represented a significant unknown. We also puzzled
over the correct route, favoring the line we'd seen to the right. But the
rescuers said that you needed to climb very far back in the chimney. It was
absolutely black and dripping wet back there. Now I wish I'd investigated
better.

I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Danno, the rescuers and the doctors and nurses
who took care of me. Danno is an avid outdoorsman, but not primarily a
climber. The facts that he held my fall, tied off the belay, made the phone
calls, identified exactly where we were, and did his best to take care of me
speak very well of him.

If there is a lesson, I guess it's an old one. An accident can happen to anybody at any time.
