### Exit 38, April 29, 2004
Josh and I unwittingly hiked past the Amazonia and Club Paradiso walls, failing
upwards all the way to the Peannicle. We saw a few sad rocks along the way, all
dripping and unattractive, so I guess it was just as well. We climbed
"Peanut Brittle," finding it a bit harder than the 5.6/5.7 rating it gets in
the guidebook. Then "Killer Bob," which had enjoyable juggy holds to escape an
overhang (5.9). Finally, we climbed "Gallivant (5.10a)," which was the longest
route, with interesting moves on a steep slab to a vertical headwall. I belayed
Josh from the top of this one, which provided a great view of the fertile valley
below. A rappel, then nice jog back to the trailhead. "Be gentle, but be
vigilant" was the catchphrase of the morning, invented from a meaty stew of
conversation about public servants, irate laypeople, a lack of toilet paper, and
egregious affronts to propriety.
