A little walk down memory lane...
  
  
Aside from a year in Houston, my Mom and I lived in Huntsville during
my elementary school years. She was trying to earn her degree as a teacher,
and raise me at the same time as a single Mom. She already had three (mostly)
grown children, and so aside from some periods where my sister Tamara came
to stay for a while it was mostly just us. The way Mom found to make a
living brought a lot of fun and excitement to my life and that's what I'd
like to share today.

Mom became the manager of a girls dormitory at Sam Houston State University,
where she also went to school. It was called Jackson-Shaver, and it was
a huge brick building, L-shaped and 5 stories high including a big basement/boiler
room. The building is still there, but changed somewhat, and now it's a
co-ed dorm. Our apartment was spacious and had it's own entrance on the
ground floor, about 15 feet away from the Sam Houston Museum. I don't remember
how many years we were there, but it was at least two.
  
  
That was a magical time for me. I was lost in a fantasy world with my
Star Wars toys a LOT. If I wasn't playing with them, I was feverishly scanning
the Sears Roebuck Christmas Catalog for pictures of strange new playsets.
Sometimes this led to disappointment. I stared at a picture of the Hoth
Action Playset so long, memorizing the marketing blurbs about the snow
cave, the elevator into the AT-AT, and all the other features, that when
I eventually got it I couldn't believe that they'd just taken the Tatoine
Desert Playset, dyed it white instead of brown, and pretended it was snow.
And the AT-AT was cardboard. Sigh. The anticipation was much more fun.
  
  
But I would take these toys all over the place. There was a little jungle
beside the Sam Houston Museum. I found a vine I could swing on. And roots
in the steep hillside provided homes for R2-D2 and deserting Stormtroopers.
  
  
I also took the toys into the dorm. This place was huge, long hallways
with red carpet smelling of fresh paint. There were two major staircases.
In the summer all the rooms would be empty for at least several weeks.
The doors to the rooms were open, exposing sturdy bunk beds with hospital-blue
mattresses. Lots of light would spill into the hallways, and I would tear
down the halls alone with an X-Wing Fighter, pleased that I could play
in any room I wanted.
  
  
I liked to go to the furthest corner of the building, 4 floors up and
at the other end of the "L." I also knew the boiler room, with the smell
of powdered industrial chemicals. The cleaning staff weren't really around
at these times. But their ghosts seemed to haunt the place: they were old,
tired grandpas and grandmas, black, with a language and demeanor that made
me think of the 1940s. The boiler room seemed to be their home, with scattered
chairs and rags indicating impromptu gatherings.
  
  
I made a friend named Kenneth. He lived in a house where someone had hung
themselves on the front porch years ago. You know that house in Forest
Gump that the female lead throws mud at? Yeah, that was his house. But
Kenneth was my best friend, and we would tear through the park or the dormitory
halls in a frenzy.
  
  
I remember deciding that there was _one_ girl in the world who _maybe_ wasn't
gross and that was Brooke Shields. I had a copy of Time Magazine with her
picture on the cover. Kenneth and I spent a hot summer evening fighting
like dogs for that picture, jumping down the stairwells 4 steps at a time
trying to keep it safe. Eventually, on the hillside in front of the dorm
it was tragically ripped in two. We mourned.
  
  
Every now and then Kenneth could stay overnight. We loved "The Twilight
Zone" and Mom would let us watch it with a bowl of popcorn soaked in butter.
One episode was called "Green Thumb," about an old woman whose hands turned
horribly into roots from her constant rooting in the soil. We had dared
each other to sleep in one of the dorm rooms that night. Padding down the
dark hallways, we reached our room, climbed to our bunks with our Star
Wars sleeping bags, and turned off the light.
  
  
I don't know when the screaming started, but we turned into single-celled
animals with one goal: GET TO THE LIGHT OF HOME. Running down dark halls
at midnight in a building like The Shining is the way I experienced going
insane and coming back again.

There was "the Noonday Terror" as well. It was very possible to hear a
strange sound, and then no matter how much light is filtering in through
the windows, the very air became pregnant with danger. As I ran, once again,
for safety, I would always see something unusual out of the corner of my
eye on that long journey, the only sound being the blood in my ears, the
swish of courdoury and socks pumping lightly on the carpet. I knew I had
to hold the scream in until reaching the last hallway with our door, sanctuary,
at the end.
  
  
Scaring myself silly became a way of life! I kind of miss it now...
  
  
Once there was a hurricane in Houston, and the rooms were full of civilians
flooded out of their homes. I remember Mom marching down the hall being
helpful but strict. "Some of these people have chickens in their rooms!"
she said. I tried walking by just to peek in the rooms, and sure enough:
I saw three chickens and a pig.
  
  
One story I never told Mom at the time, because I was afraid it would
get me banned from my visits throughout the dorm, was the time when a high
school cheerleading convention took place at the University. The ground
floor was full of high school girls for several days. My reliable partner,
Kenneth, and I were playing with a big cardbox box in a hallway. I threw
the box at him, but it hit a door. To our surprise a girl came out and
stood in the middle of the hall, completely undressed! "Theresa?" she said.
She say two 11-year old boys sitting at her feet looking up at her with
I can only imagine what expressions. She screamed and ran in slamming the
door.
  
  
Looking back in all seriousness, and with some dismay, I'm sure there
was no event in at least 5 years in past or future that caused such strong
laughter. I laughed from the depths of my soul. Kenneth and I were rolling
and crying and hurting with laughter for at least 10 minutes. It was, of
course, funny, but it was like a gift from God too because we, completely
undeserving, got to see a "naked lady" as part of the bargain. And to share
that experience! It's like, not only was it funny, but it said that, in
life, we were going to Do OK. The loose dust bunnies of insecurity that
had begun to cling to us even at that age were blown away so completely
that I'm tempted to divide time into Before and After.
  
  
How many evenings as the summer wore on would we share a Dr. Pepper and
remember that day? So, so many.
  
  
The girl recovered, and re-emerged with a mission for us. She led us into
the bathroom quietly where her roommate was taking a shower. She PULLED
back the shower curtain with predictable results. Were we performers or
observers? That's the beauty of it, we were both! By this point, I was
laughing more by thinking from the point of view of the girl in the shower:
how strange to see two slack-eyed little boys standing incongruously in
the steamy bathroom! After that the fun was over and they sent us packing.
  
  
Sometimes, I guess in the younger years, I was a little mascot. Girls
would pick me up and spin me around. I remember them being all Juicy Fruit,
earrings, makeup and feathered hair. I would make a few bucks by feeding
fish while they were on winter break.
  
  
Other memories of those years are my cat Dorshka, who I bonded with strongly.
He slept on my bed every night, reliably rolling onto his back so I could
rub his stomach to loud purrs. Also playing the violin. I read my first
adult book at that time, something science fiction that was really hard
to read but I forced it down because of the skepticism in my Moms eyes.
"Are you sure you can read that?"
  
  
I would visit my dad some weekends, often taking the bus to Houston, spending
a lot of time among those little black and white televisions bolted onto
waiting room seats. I would come home from those visits kind of a wreck,
stomach tied in knots from stress, legs cramping from too much walking
at some kind of Astrodome Winnebago convention.
  
  
I remember Mom studying, making spaghetti, sitting on the couch she'd
reupholstered in blue. I think she was really smart in the job she chose.
I really don't remember her "working," though there were stories of having
to rescue one girl or another from the bar across the street. Once a girl
got drunk on shampoo. But these were always nocturnal events, when I was
safely in bed with Dorshka.
  
  
Next time I'll write about Malone Apartments, where Mom managed a "married
student housing" row of cinderblock dwellings. This was a very different
experience, but it had a full share of fun as well.
