Georg and I got out reeeally early before work to climb this nice icefall before
it falls down in warm weather. We were in the dark the whole time. Georg
took the first short pitch after about 10 minutes of walking from the car.
Nice!

He led up some easy steps (easy WI3) to an anchor. I led the next pitch, of
similar length, but a notch harder at easy WI4. I'm using the word easy so much
because the climb has been very popular, and often existing tool placements
could be hooked. We never saw screw holes, but it was clear the way everyone
went.

After this nice pitch, Georg got the crux, a WI5 pillar that is vertical for a
good distance. He climbed up cauliflowered ice petals, then placed a couple
screws to protect his entry into steep terrain. Following, I enjoyed the pitch
very much, though my right index finger nearly froze somehow! I warmed up at the
bolt-anchor belay, then led the final pitch. It was solid WI4, with a short
vertical section bedeviled by weeping, running water and some rotten ice.
I guess it's a good thing we didn't come later in the day! Foolishly, I dropped
the second screw I placed, leaving me with only four screws for the pitch. At
the end, I had to really run it out!

We gained the top, and it got light as Georg came up. Nice! Two quick double
rope rappels and we were at the packs. Back in Munich by 9:30!
