### Scheinbergspitz
_December 2, 2007_

Wow, I'm really short on short reports this year! Oh well. I got out Sunday
morning for a few hours to ski up and down the Scheinbergspitz in the Ammergau
Alps. It's about 3 kilometers west of the famous castle Linderhof (I still
haven't been in there, though Daniel recommends it highly). The weather was
much better than expected, mostly blue sky, a few small snow flurries. The 1000
meter ascent was straightforward. I left my skis at the base of the summit
pyramid and hobbled up an icy slope to gain the ridge, then made use of a fixed
line to help climb the final 50 feet. The views were gorgeous. It looked like
rain over the lowlands, but the snowy peaks were shining. I especially liked
the view off towards Reutte and the Plansee (hidden from here). The Allg√§u and
Lechquellengebirge are very beautiful and rugged.

Going down was hard. I was just very tense and afraid of falling in the kind of
crusty, poor snow conditions that prevailed. Especially once back in the forest
where narrow tobaggan runs gave no chance to slow down. I provided a lot of
comedy for the (now) crowded trail. Finally I remembered some things from my
ski class the year before, and made a few good turns in untracked snow of the
forest. 4.5 hours up and down.
