Hi gang! Just an update on my new world:
  
  
You have to bring your own bag for your groceries!
  
  
There are no paper towels, it's all about damp rags in kitchens.
  
  
Toilet paper is thicker, by quite a bit!

Banks cost money, charging a monthly fee. They are so different from each
other, that what bank you have is a topic of endless conversation.
  
  
Credit cards are rarely used. We have a Visa card, and I was surprised
to hear "sorry, we take american express and mastercard" or some other
combination. Even in computer/electronic stores, cash is required.
  
  
The subway system is amazing, but because it runs on an honor system there
are occasional "crackdowns" where they surround a station and make sure
everyone inside has a valid ticket. They call you a "Schwarzfahrer" if
you are caught: a "black rider".
  
  
Water is not a human right. Don't expect ice, Germans think it's unhealthy
and bad for your teeth. On the other hand, NxN is like Microsoft, it has
free drinks. Of course, they aren't things like Coke, they are...like..."Tea
Österreicher" or "Viola - frische!" some kind of lightly flavored limpid
pool. (Not complaining! not complaining! :0 )
  
  
I bought a bike, really nice mountain bike with the 2 lamps required to
be legal. I was worried about it being stolen but as I went to work I saw
rows and rows of bikes parked by the subway - with no locks! People always
get their lost wallets returned with all the money inside, and the finders
often went through a lot of work to find the owner (just today Frau Burger
got a call from a stranger because he found an appointment book which listed
her for 2 pm. It belonged to the handyman coming at 2 to fix the stairs,
he was happy to get it back, and yes, there was money inside!).
  
  
Less Germans speak English that you might have thought. Or been led to
believe! But on the whole, I enjoy trying out my stilted, halting German
on folks. What's depressing is that some of them will suddenly understand
English, unfortunately realizing that their poor English is better than
my best German. :-)
  
  
My work collegues speak in German a lot more than I expected, making me
really feel the need to take classes soon! On the other hand, because it's
a technical job, I get a lot of the individual words. In fact, it's considered
sophisticated to speak "Denglish" (Deutsch + English), and it's not that
hard to do. Just mix and match the words below to get a taste:
  
  
Deutsch English
  
-------------------------------------------------------------
  
Ich glaube, das Computer
  
Denkst du, daß das Exception
  
eigentlich ein Bug
  
wirklich! der Printer
  
ein Fehler das Inputbox
  
man muß das nicht machen! Windows
  
  
So maybe I'll be speaking natively with my collegues sooner than I hoped.
:-)
  
  
Without Kris here to manage the paperwork I am already drowning in forms.
You have to register yourself at city hall before you can do anything.
You also have to get a Lohnsteuerkarte (sort of a W2 form). Also, for my
work visa I had extra work to do in that building. Today I had a 3 hour
session there, going to the waiting room that corrosponds to last name
"St", getting a paper ticket with the number 203 on it. Currently serving
number 160\. A bell rings, and number 161 is supposed to go into door number
4, while a somewhat dejected looking person walks out (presumably number
160). I repeated this procedure on three different floors, one floor per
function, then I paid 70 dollars for the privilege. Cash only of course!
  
  
No sales tax! It's pretty nice to pay exactly what the price says.
  
  
No tipping! Well, you could tip if something was excellent. But they don't
like it so much, that I already had a friend who was a waiter in the states
for a while say he was offended to get a tip if he didn't do something
over the top. The tipper was being rather weak-minded.
