## Thursday

After sleeping in the van, I drove another hour to Obergurgl for my
goal for the day: Hochfirst. I skied up through the ski area, then
turned off into the Gai√übergtal. I came to the glacier and continued
following some old ski tracks. Other tracks went off to the north, up
the rather melted-out south slope. I thought that was strange. What I
didn't know was that that was the correct way to go!

At the last minute, I brought crampons and ice axe. I was glad for them,
because the glacier had exposed blue ice that I needed to climb up
for at least a short section. It looked like I could ski again higher.
I put my skis on my pack (insecurely...the pack doesn't have the appropriate
straps), and started to climb. My ice ax was a bit too dull for the hard
ice. After about 20 minutes, I could switch back to skis.

I enjoyed switchbacking up the glacier, though in the upper section I
was dodging some pretty good-sized crevasses. I'd have to take exactly
the same way down, and even then, I had some worry about snow-bridge
collapse. This was a bit more serious than I expected!

I entered a bowl below the Gaisbergjoch. I removed skis, and climbed to
the saddle, now on the border of Italy. Views to the east into that
country were spectacular. However, the mountain Hochfirst looked quite
intimidating above me to the north. I had 250 meters to reach the summit,
but many buttresses barred the way. I traversed over, being careful on
the corniced ridge, but relatively quickly I saw that it was untenable
for me to make this climb alone in snowy conditions. If it was less than
vertical it was also terribly loose, and untraveled as well. If it
was vertical, it at least had shard-like overhanging rocks to grab onto,
but who knows how secure they are? I found no trace of scraped up
rock due to winter climbers in crampons. I found it strange that the
guidebook described this as being "ohne besondere schwierigkeit" (without
special difficulties).

The way is shut on Hochfirst.

Sadly, I took a few pictures and carefully climbed down to my skis, first
checking out another possible option off in the middle of the south face.
In here I lost my camera case, it fell down into rocks and there was
no way I'd go get it.

Back at the skis, I was able to get down to the blue ice. I actually thought
I might be able to scrape down the ice, but a couple meters into it I saw
that was insane. So, I switched gear again and climbed down facing in.
Below, I could ski again, but suffered a few jarring jolts when I skied
over hard ice blocks.

Ach, goodbye Hochfirst.

Happy to be safely again off the glacier.

A big day, with about 1300 meters up and down.

## Friday

After sleeping near Umhausen, I headed in to ski up Kuhscheibe, last done
many years ago with Christian. This was a nice trip, and skiing was neither
great nor terrible. About 1500 meters up and down.
