### Wendelstein
<i>November 26, 2011</i>

A quick hike up the Wendelstein in the morning from the toll road high point. In blowing snow, I reached the house at the top of the lift, continued to the summit, then descended in interesting weather via the corkscrew trail that descends to the north, wrapping around the east and back to the south. Nice hike.
