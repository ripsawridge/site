### Guffertspitze
_July 8, 2006_

Danno and I wanted to go for a rock climb this morning, but heavy clouds
persuaded us to go for a hike instead. I'd seen the impressive Guffertspitze
earlier from Buchstein, and thought it would make a great morning trip. So, we
headed up in fog and clouds for some exercise. Apparently the mountain isn't
too crowded because there are no huts or restaurants along the way or on the
summit. The climb is over 1000 meters, and via pretty steep trail. Dan and I
had a great time talking about all kinds of things. One of our best ideas was
to build a new software process model around the ideas and language of Bertold
Brecht. Keep an eye out on Slashdot!

Near the summit the route followed a nice thin ridge, with what must have been
spectacular views into the Rofan mountains to the south. We also enjoyed the
"Scottish Highlands" character of the rocky barrens below the summit block.
Going down a different way, over the Guffertstein, we found the necessary
uphill climb a little annoying, but then a broad meadow and a herd of GÃ¤mse
cheered us up. Then the knee-pounding descent reminded us that alas we are
frail! Good exercise, but we'll have to return for bigger views.
