Friday afternoon, a friend called to talk about Colchuck Peak, saying
"The glacier should have hard water ice, and slopes about 40 to 45
degrees for 400 feet. Yeah, I'll bring some ice screws, and you
bring yourself an ice tool in addition to ax and crampons."


"Okay, sounds great!" Gulp. 


On Saturday Kris, Marco and I stopped by Peter's apartment to borrow his
X-15 hammerhead ice tool. I hefted it experimentally, excited and
apprehensive to use such a wicked instrument for the first time.
Unlike a traditional ice ax, an ice tool looks like a device
from a science fiction movie, probably carried by bloodthirsty
aliens. The pick is sharp, and droops audaciously. The instrument
is meant to be held and swung like a hammer, compact and powerful.
The experience of climbing steep snow and ice faces with tools
like these was romanticized and distorted in my mind by dozens
of stories, many of them grim. As I tried to sleep Saturday night,
my mind kept envisioning difficult ice down-climbs in blowing
snow. I finally ended up reading a book, giving up on sleep as
an option. Apparently, my mind was quite bent out of shape over
this new experience!

Alex K. was able to join us, and he picked me up at 4:00 am Sunday.
We would meet some friends at the trail-head. I kissed Kris goodbye,
still up working on a web page, and we drove over Steven's Pass,
disheartened by the rain and snow. The sky cleared as we headed
south and east. At the trail-head we had high clouds and patches
of sky, beautiful pink and orange in the sunrise. We waited until
7:00 for the others, then headed up alone. Alex had climbed
Colchuck Peak at least once, and assured me the terrain wasn't
difficult enough for a second tool, much less a rope. Uncertain,
I brought the X-15, and we took turns carrying the rope.



Trace amounts of crunchy snow lined the trail we followed in the
gently rising valley. The snow increased with the angle as we
wandered up and left to Colchuck Lake. It had taken 1:45 to here.
The view was dominated by Dragontail Peak - a
glowering fortress of black ridges and towers. Sinewous fingers of
snow ran like capillaries across it's broad, shattered bulk.
Alex had climbed the Triple Colouirs and the Serpentine Arete,
two excellent routes on this fantastic mountain. Our goal for
today lay to the right of it, across a narrow saddle and
up a shattered ridge. Below the saddle was a snowy moraine and
a smooth, white glacier. Aside from some crevasses on the right,
this looked easy. The really impressive glacier was right below
the rock walls of Colchuck. Crumbling blocks of ice would provide
an adventure over there for someone else.


We rounded the lake, greeting some hardy campers from the Buckeye
state. The going got tough as we tottered up snow-covered boulders
to the moraine. They were slippery and filled with land mines.
Stepping on a patch of snow between boulders might provide nice
footing, or it might quickly accept your entire leg, leaving you
dangling awkwardly above a cave in the snow. We crested a rise,
leaving the boulders for deep snow. Alex ploughed straight up
a moderately steep slope to gain the morainal ridge. This was
a good idea, since snow blew off of there to fill the bowl we
climbed. We would have shallow snow. But it was very hard work
getting up there, and Alex bulldogged the whole thing. Some high
wind and welcome icy rock was preferable to the deep snow, and
we followed the ridge until it ran out at the glacier.


Alex started up while I put on a sweater and windproof gloves.
My fingers had gotten too cold, and it took a painful 20 minutes
to warm them as I climbed. By the time I caught up to him, we
had passed much of the water ice section of the glacier, and
the worst of the post-holing. The ice was very hard and slippery,
but there was just enough surface snow to make crampons unnecessary.
Also, the angle was very low. I laughed at my apprehensions of
the night, and keenly felt the sleep debt! We passed crevasses
on our left, but they were quite filled in with snow and harmless.
The final stretch of the glacier took a long time, but finally
we stood at the saddle. Alex pointed out the improbable Boving
route, a difficult crack and face climb on Dragontail.


Alex made his way up the ridge and I followed on the mixture of
deep snow, boulders and ledges. We had an exciting look down
a snowy colouir as we climbed past an exposed notch. If you
climb over the little tree, it's third class! We continued,
slowing down in the deep snow. At one point, everywhere I
stepped caused the snow to collapse to my level. I tried
to "swim" on the snow by rolling onto it with knees, chest
and elbows, but not even this worked! Finally a traverse
to a rocky ledge provided an out. However, the bouldering
and conditions were fun in a way. It was awesome that the
clouds were still high, although dropping to obscure mountains
in the west.



We reached the summit, and Alex said "oh!" pointing out
the true summit down across and up, probably 50 feet above us.
With this snow, we knew how long it would take to get over there.
It was 1 pm already, so we made this our high point. Alex's
camera had two pictures, so we each picked our portrait backdrops.
Alex had the view over to Stuart and Argonaut. I had the walls
of Dragontail. Immediately we headed down, taking only an hour
to get to the boulders 300 feet above the lake. There was
a bitter, stinging wind at the saddle, then unnerving slips on
the water ice, but mostly deep plunge steps in the snow.
Alex heard a voice and saw someone coming up the boulders, then 
lost the shadowy figure. Just as he decided it must have been 
a hallucination, I heard something and said "Hello?" to the
cold rocks below. "Hey, Michael!" they said back. Someone we knew had
shown up, and we had an impromptu conversation
on the slope. We resumed the trip down and around the
lake. 


The long slog down began, and the light gradually dimmed. There
was a lot to talk about, so things went quickly. Only the last
mile seemed to last too long, as usual! I kept seeing cars
in the river rocks. Just when I really wished I had a headlamp, 
we reached the parking lot. Beer and food from the Brewpub
was sorely needed and much appreciated!


Thanks to Alex for the ride and great companionship! 
We had excellent music on the way home.
