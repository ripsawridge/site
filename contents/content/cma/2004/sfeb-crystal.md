### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Feb 20-21, 2004

Kris and I stayed two nights at Crystal Mountain for skiing. I bought a
new book about it and learned some great new techniques. Kris had her
new skis, and they were taking some adjustment to learn about. She also
took a lesson, but it was disappointing. Also, snowboarders bumped into
her and knocked her over twice on one run, so we were both kind of unhappy.
The next day I got up early and skied, doing better at making many short
turns. Then Kris came out and again had a challenging time. We decided
to go home a day early, as she was really sore. Oh well, better luck
next time!
