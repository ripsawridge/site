The Narrenkopf


I had a day free to hike, and wanted to do something pretty long.
I decided to start from the town of Rietz and climb the north
slope of the Sellrain Mountains to reach the Narrenkopf and
hopefully Hocheder above it.

The journey started in typically ugly forest slash along the
lower Rietzer Bach. Tiring of roads, I decided to just follow
a ridge up for about 500 meters elevation gain to reach a
broad road that crosses the ridge below the Peter-Anich Hütte.
This was very interesting. I like the subtle joy of routefinding
in a steep forest.

Bits of sun were coming out at the hut, though I decided to save a visit for
later on my way back. Finally I was in alpine country, following
switchbacks along the Klausbach stream. My information about the
Narrenkopf was that some kind of trail should appear up the eastern
slope of the valley at flat country around 2250 meters elevation.
Sure enough, it was there. The trail curved around and led me
to the summit in screaming wind and light snowfall.
Hocheder was buried in cloud, so I decided not to climb up there.

On the way down I went past the goatherders hut and circled on the arm
above a little lake. There was a picnic bench up here...a pleasant place!

Then I descended by the Rauher Kopf on decent trail, and finally
in latschen to the Peter-Anich Hütte. I went inside, had a beer and
talked to other hikers in the area. This is a strange and forgotten place, which
I liked very much.

I reversed my trail up pretty easily and soon returned to the car in the deep
woods.
