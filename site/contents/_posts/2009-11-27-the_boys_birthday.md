It's their birthday! We read this little story (but in German) at school
about their life so far. They walked around the earth, once per year, and
showed some photos to the other kids. Kris made "Monster Cupcakes," out
of chocolate cake with amazing cream cheese icing. Each monster had fearsome
eyes and teeth!
