I'm working on an 8- climb in the gym. It is tougher than any other 8-
I've mastered. I'm keeping notes here in hopes of eventually leading it clean.

I've marked holds that are interesting at this point.

## The start

It is straightforward on the right wall for a while. After making the third
clip it is time to touch the blue wall. Foothold #1 gets the left foot on
it so that the left arm can reach over to #3. Then you swap feet, getting the
right foot on #1.

## The grappling

The next interesting move involves hold #6, far out on the right. One is
tempted to ignore it, but it is necessary to bend down a bit and hold it
with the right hand. The left foot remains on the blue wall, and there is
a tough move getting the right foot from #4 to #5. When you can get a hand
on #9 (very small but sharp incut hold) you've completed this section and are
relatively stable in the corner between the blue and tan walls.

## The Triangles

The next section has ingenious footholds on black structure at #10 and #11.
At #10, with the right foot on #7, you have a very nice rest, and can
shake out the left hand. It is likely both hands are on the black
triangle at #12 at this point. Move the left foot up to #11, then you can
reach the excellent hold at #13 on the right side of the uppermost black
triangle. You also get the right foot on #9 in this area, a very good hold.

Put the right hand on TOP of the left hand at this point. Everything depends
on this small hold #13. Get directly beneath it, and paste your left foot
on the blue wall right below the large green hold under #12 (sorry, forgot to
label this one), and then bring your right hip into the wall and set your
right foot on this large green hold. Now PUSH, standing up on your right
foot such that your right hip is touching the wall, allowing your right
hand (remember, it was on top of the left hand on hold #13) to reach up to
hold #15.

Move swiftly but carefully here. You need to make room on hold #15 for your
left hand to slide in and become dominant via interlocked finger release.
Ideally, you'll grab the hold with your right hand one finger length up
and right of what you would prefer, pre-allocating space for the left
hand to work its way in.

Both feet now are on that important green block underneath #12. Now the right
arm cycles up and around and down (huge shoulder rotation) to land on
#16. You can rest here a moment.

Adjust the handhold so that you can lean out from the wall. Your goal is
to get your left foot on the apex of the black triangle at #12. Be sure
not to touch any plastic hold -- you are only allowed to use the black
structure. Your right foot (as you stand up) can rest on the right side
of the triangle. The right hand can move up, then the right foot delicately
positions on #14 -- not a very secure position, but it only needs to
succeed long enough to get the left foot on #13, which is excellent.

Congratulations -- you've done more than half of the route, and now have
a few easy moves before the upper crux! Life becomes very hard again at the
green undercling hold straight out left from the left shoulder of the woman
being lowered down. No need to offer detailed description until that point.
