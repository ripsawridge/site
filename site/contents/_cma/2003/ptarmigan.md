Two days after returning from the awesome Bugaboo/Selkirks trip with
Robert and Mark, I was driving behind Theron as we set up our car
shuttle for the Ptarmigan Traverse. We dropped off my car at the
Downey Creek trailhead, and continued up to Cascade Pass, finally
ready to begin hiking around 10:30 am. The long hours of driving had
definitely surprised us, and kind of lowered my ambitions for the
first day. Our packs felt heavy with 6 days of food and fuel, along
with sleeping gear and minimal climbing equipment.


At Cascade Pass we took in the view, then kept going towards the
Cache Glacier. A guy came down and told us about climbing Mt. Formidable,
something we planned to do the next day. The view of Sahale Arm is spectacular
from this point about 500 feet above Cascade Pass. It reminded
me of something I'd read about the Emperor Maximilian who described
the Tyrol (a mountainous region in Austria and northern Italy) as
a quilt that could be shaken for resources. Sahale Arm resembled that
quilt, with people going up and down the trails, and a host of marmots,
deer and other "game" animals present.


There was no need to rope up on the Cache Glacier, and here we took advantage
for the first time of a trip tradition - "dipping our cups." This phrase would
be used in innumerable variations, like "come! let us dip our cups together
in this fine mountain stream!" and "lo! let us..." you get the picture!

We stepped over a moat at the top of the glacier, and suddenly had the 
north face of Mt. Formidable in front of us, and a whole new deep valley
to look at. We hiked down sometimes awkward scree and rocks, realizing
we'd probably see a lot of this kind of terrain in the low snow year.
Just as I was thinking we'd have to be careful and not twist an ankle,
we came to Kool-Aid Lake and met Peggy Goldman and her husband. He
had torn a muscle while hiking among the rocks. At that moment a
helicopter arrived to take him to a hospital. He was in good spirits
though, having enjoyed a great climbing season thus far! Peggy had
just climbed the last of the 100 highest peaks in Washington the
day before with Mt. Formidable. That's a very impressive achievement.
I consider myself to be someone who climbs a lot, but I've only climbed
about 15 of those over the years. 


Peggy would hike out the next morning. She gave us some advice for
the climb of Formidable, saying we should bring a rope even though the
route is "3rd class." She also said there were nice camp sites after
Red Ledge with a great view of the mountain. Theron and I hiked up
there, across the crumbly Red Ledge, and up into a heather and boulder
garden that was really pretty. We set up our first camp, eating dinner while
studying the north side of Formidable. Such a great camp. We had our
MP3 players which was great. As it turned out, I snored terribly, and
Theron had to wake me up a few times. That was the last night he
slept in the tent, preferring the out-of-doors to my raging inability
to be quiet when sleeping. Sorry, Theron!

The next morning, Formidable looked great in the warm sun and blue sky.
We walked for a while, soon roping up for our first real glacier:
the Middle Cascade. We passed a few crevasses, each of us getting used
to the idea of moving farther away from civilization and chance of a
timely rescue. I think I was more cautious on this glacier, but by the
end of the trip I was bull dogging us towards the more dramatic ice bridges.
I found the route finding on the glaciers to be a really exciting part of
the trip. Especially as you make bolder choices, you can't be completely
sure of what is ahead, and there is a pleasant tension as you follow your
nose.

Soon we reached the col where a dramatic view of Sentinel and Old Guard
Peaks awaited. We went down some moderately steep hard snow, our first chance to
exercise "french technique" with heavy packs. We'd been seeing bear tracks
near the col, and amazingly they went down this terrain. We crossed a
bench of rock and snow, drinking from a stream along the way. Reaching our
turn-off to climb Mt. Formidable, we dropped our packs and consolidated gear
for the hike. Easily over the col, then down a loose gully, we made our
way onto permanent snow fields and ribs of the broad south face. Our
advice from Peggy was to keep going left longer than you think you should.
The route seemed to end at a steep rib, but we found that by scrambling
up onto the rib, the route can be picked up again. Another party was wandering
far to the east, having missed this notion. We yodelled to them that we'd
found the way, and they began hurrying over.


After a pretty hike up the rib, we put on crampons for a snow field. At the top
of this, we began scrambling 3rd and 4th class rock for a long twisty 
journey to the summit. There were some exposed ledges to cross, and one
notable gully marked by cairns that would have seemed improbable if not for
faint signs of passage. Above this, more loose scrambling led us up, where
we lost the route and ended up climbing a secondary summit, with the true
summit across a steep ridge to the west. We found a rappel station, and
abseiled into a notch where we could easily climb to the summit.

It was a great view, with tantalizing scenes of what was to follow: miles
of ice and rock, surrounded by mysterious green valleys. The back side
of Johannesberg Mountain was loose, craggy and massive. We saw Jens and
Loren's entry in the summit about a North Face climb. We promised to come
back one day for the North Ridge. As it was though, the standard route offered
pretty nice scrambling and interesting route finding. I kind of expected
to be keening for a north side route, but this was plenty enjoyable.
We made one rappel on the way down, possibly foolish due to loose rock that
barely missed Theron.


After the hike back up the steep gully and down to our packs, we were fairly
tired. It didn't take long to reach Yang Yang Lakes, very pretty in the
late afternoon. Here we were realizing that the distances to cover from
camp to camp are not that great. It's stopping for climbs along the way
that makes it more than a 3-day trip. For example, you could reach Yang Yang
Lakes on day one.


We went for a short hike, trying to guess where the route would go the
next morning. It is not completely obvious, but you'll figure it out when
you go. The party that was on Formidable beat us to the lake, getting a
fantastic camp site (they left the true summit for another day, so didn't
have the mandatory hour of gazing at the Beloveds). So camp wasn't that
great, but I got some good reading in while Theron sat by a stream and
took some pictures after dinner. We allowed ourselves a nip of Tequila,
and another in the morning to warm the region about the chest and torso.
Tee hee!

<h3>Wednesday <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


Hiking early, we followed the steep trail up a boulder field to a 
steep entry to the broad heathered ridge directly above us. This was one
of the most beautiful spots of the trip: the North Arm of Le Conte 
Mountain. A heather garden with granite slabs, golden in the morning sun.
It was a great place to spend the morning. 


Reaching snow beneath the upper mountain, we decided not to climb it.
Part of it was the terrain that lay ahead: we were kind of unsure how
we'd navigate steep-looking terrain of the Le Conte Glacier, and we
definitely wanted to climb Old Guard or Sentinel. That old summit feeling
wasn't there for Le Conte. As Chris Koziarz would say, we didn't
"smell the summit." 


So we continued on snow and rock, traversing the east side of a ridge.
Once I reached a dead end at a steep 100 foot drop off. I scrambled up
rock in crampons for 250 feet to get around it, then continued on
glacial ice back down the other side. I was enjoying trying to be
smart about keeping crampons on. Of course, that mostly played out as
scraping across rocky sections in them. Theron was more careful with his
'pons, preferring to remove them for these changes. I can report however,
that my aluminum Stubai crampons (purchased from Pro Mountain Sports, by
the way, gotta plug that awesome store), are still in great shape!


"Gotta be ready for 'The Winter of Mixed!'" I would cry to Theron.


We finally roped up for the glacier after a cooling drink of ice water.
Pretty soon, we came to a crux spot. Faint tracks led into a maw that
we didn't approve of. But there was no way around! (we checked). So we
followed, and were rewarded with a short steep ice step that took us
easily through. I chopped one handhold more to increase the drama than
for anything else. But it gave me a secure stance to take a picture of
Theron!

Energized by the fun glacier crossing, we dropped our packs near the 
7300 foot col to the South Cascade Glacier, and set off southeast to
the base of Old Guard Peak, having decided it looked the "coolest."
Traversing above a large bergschrund, we gained the notch between
the two peaks. An icy gully led us to an awkward step onto a rock
slab. We actually carried an ice screw, and here it got it's only
use of the trip! We used it to anchor our crampons and axes to the
ice, something necessary because there was nowhere on the rock to
put them, and the moat between the rock and ice was deep and dark.

<i>The Chickamin Glacier, wow.</i><br></center>



We enjoyed the route-finding up indistinct rocky terrain. The
bergschrund below kept our attention focused on the next hand and foot
holds. These "scrambling" peaks were definitely more challenging than
I expected, and I, jaded, had just returned from the Bugaboos.
But it made the summit more rewarding. In fact, we eventually declared
the view from Old Guard Peak the best of the trip. Agnes Creek and
the Chickamin Glacier were stunningly beautiful, especially the
sweep of the lower glacier as it reaches it's terminus 1000 feet
above the creek. Deep gorges below the Dana Glacier contained
waterfalls, and Elephant Head Peak looked amazing. I think it's an
under rated peak of the area, we are going back for it. It took a long
time before we were ready to leave.


After carefully crabbing down to our ice gear, we retraced our steps
down the glacier. It was a great feeling to be romping on a
remote glacier like it was our own backyard. The sun shining down,
and lots of little jumps to make over crevasses. We got down to a
gathering of people near our packs. It was two sets of two people doing
the traverse. We talked for a while, continuing together on a snow
traverse above the South Cascade Glacier. 


When it seemed like the right spot, Theron and I stopped for some food,
and to climb Sentinel Peak. The others continued on ahead. I ate a Nutella
sandwich - I was pretty over the moon about that. Theron had developed a
taste for Nutella too (the European Hazelnut Spread!). We hiked up steep
heather, getting great views of the glacier below. We weren't really on
the normal route, we'd climbed up the south ridge to where it became
loose and craggy. We gave up the climb here, not feeling like wending our
way among crumbly towers just for the tick. White Rock Lakes and their 
fabled beauty was on our minds instead.


On the way down, I saw a bear loping across the glacier. He came very close
to where (yikes!) we'd left our packs. If he smelled the European Hazelnut
Spread, we might have been done for. Or at least reduced to begging.


We came down making loud silly noises to scare him away. I rounded a corner
and saw that our packs were unmolested and the bear was gone. That was
a close one! Soon we were descending steep scree to the glacier and hiking
across. There was no need to rope up on the broad snow field, and we were thankful
to reach a patch of shade on the opposite side. More steep scree and 
boulder fields led down to the lakes. I'd gotten better at "boot skiing"
on the stuff, I think my tendency to always wear my gaiters made this easier
(less pebbles in my boots).


The scenery at the lakes was even better than we expected. Of course, we
were a big crowd now, and our tendency to climb peaks always made us late
for the good camps. We found two decent flat spots about 100 feet apart,
and fell to snapping pictures, napping, drinking, then eating dinner.
After dinner all eight of us gathered and passed around our bottle of
white tequila, while we marvelled at the terrain ahead. It looked very
improbable and steep. All of us were "traverse virgins," so we were excited
about the discoveries to be made the next day. Theron and I identified
a distinctive snow patch that would be a good marker if we could find it
the next day.

I didn't set up the tent, but I eventually got cold enough to wrap it 
around me at 3 in the morning. Darn, that made my sleeping bag wet though.
My summer bag is really small and light, but it needs a little help from
a tent or bivy sack.

<h3>Thursday <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


Ah, Thursday morning, day four of the trip. We took off on a brushy trail
that led down and into a rocky bowl. Theron had a scare when I went too
far ahead and he saw a side trail, wondering which way I had taken. 
I often was a bit ahead, too excited to stop, and I had an easier camera
setup than Theron. Oh, I didn't mention how much I liked having a
Platypus water bag. My pack's "crampon pouch" holds it really well, and it's
very nice to keep drinking even without stopping. And we never carried more
than a quart at a time due to the abundant streams. We trusted the water,
getting away without using iodine pills until the last day of the trip.
Some would describe this attitude as careless. I'm afraid I'll have to be
burned once to give it up, I understand there is a risk of illness. However,
it feels too good to just fill my tin cup from the stream and
drink. The cup is stored on a carabiner with my camera, easily used without
stopping. Theron and I both enjoyed this aspect of our week out, and made
all kinds of jokes about it.


Another great joke was the alter-egos we'd developed. These characters had a
curious fixation on the bottle of tequila, and could mutter for 10 minutes
at a time about how you don't take a man's bottle from him. You can take a
man's fambly away, but not the BOTTLE, no never that.

We crossed patches of ice then rock. Back on snow, we reached the
first crevasses and stepped across. A long rocky section was walked in
crampons and we carried coils between us. Everyone else apparently went
down a dirt gully here for 200 feet and got onto gentle snow fields to avoid
the glacier proper. It was fun to weave among the crevasses instead for
the most enjoyable glacier meandering of the trip. Following fins of ice,
we sometimes cramponed down to a shelf and up the other side.
Theron led us onto a gentle but distinct fin leading towards Spire Point.
We had to be careful crossing some melting snow bridges on the upper part.
Suddenly we were on top, eagerly dropping our gear and scrambling to
the ridge crest over large blocks. Now we could see Itswoot Ridge and
Cub Lake, glimmering in the sun. 


It was time to enjoy some "Hit" Cookies. These are calorie rich, and only
cost $1.00 for a pack at REI. One pack serves as a hearty lunch. Theron
looked around for a place to take off his boots and not lose them. I 
recognized the distinctive motions and facial expression that signaled his
desire to do that, and divined his wish before he said anything. That made
us laugh, I guess we'd gotten to know each other pretty well.


It was interesting to compare what we did. Seeing how important it was
to Theron to wash every day, I wondered why I didn't mind going to bed
relatively dusty. I rarely took off my boots during the day, but Theron
thrived on that. I needed to eat a lot more than him, I think my dinners
were almost twice as large. I was the rope coiler/uncoiler, and Theron
got water for dinner most of the time. I would turn in early and read a
book, while Theron sat up taking pictures until the last light. I reckoned
we could get along all winter on an ice floe if we had to.


Anyway, it was time for our climb of Spire Point. We followed a rocky
slope to the west to reach the North Ridge. Coming back east a few paces, we
found the "obvious gully," and Theron took off on a 25 meter doubled rope for
the first pitch. He reached a good ledge after some fun 5.5 climbing.
There was a sling here, which we used as an anchor. Theron then continued
up and to the left, eventually committing to a leftward traverse above a
blank, mossy slab. He did a great job on the serious pitch, especially as
gear was very sparse and hiking boots felt insecure on the small footholds.
I followed, kind of alarmed when I cleaned some gear and the rock supporting
it nearly fell out when I hung on it for a moment. The pitch ended at an
incredible stance on the northeast side of the spire. Theron wanted to
lead the last pitch too, so I belayed him out for the easiest section of the
route, though it had the best views. Soon I joined him on the summit.

How often can I praise the views from summits along this traverse? The
surroundings from here were much craggier with countless sub-spires and
ridges. You could climb for days around here. The south face seems like
a great route, and I even saw two people hiking up to do it (big crowd
out here, eh?). We downclimbed a bit, then made two rappels and scrambled
the rest of the way down.


Now we descended Itswoot Ridge, first on snow, then on rock and scree for
almost 2000 feet. Once I freaked out when Theron led us down a
chillingly steep heather slope. I had to use my ice axe to climb back
up and go down the normal trail in the scree. He has much greater tolerance
for tottering on steep heather than I do! But in the end, we reached the
camp on the ridge, and drank deeply from cold streams. I haven't talked much
about the weather, because there was none. Except for Tuesday, which had
some afternoon clouds, every day had been hot and cloudless. On the sunny south
flank of the mountain, even I had to enjoy a cold foot bath. We shared
camp with two parties of two from the previous day. It looked like the hike
to Dome Peak would be an extravaganza of boulder fields for miles.

<h3>Friday <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


In the morning, we dutifully set off first, following trail, then cairns,
then finally just following our noses up boulder-strewn slopes. A few hours
passed uneventfully. Clouds had come in, and seemed to be lowering.
The summit of Dome was occasionally obscured. We reached the glacier, which
provided a gentle walk up to a bergschrund which we passed on the right.
Taking the easiest way, we went back left and got onto rocks where we could
drop axes, crampons and rope. A fun scramble led us up the ridge to an
exposed and tricky final move. Theron was pretty amazed by it, and we
took some pictures of the action.


Clouds were moving in, but we got some of the final views of Glacier Peak
to the south, and mysterious mountains to the east. Soon, the other two parties
arrived, and we took turns taking pictures and talking about the trip. We'd
all thought it was a great success.

<i>Theron and I on the summit.</i><br></center>



On the way down, Theron lobbied to climb another peak, such as Dynaflow Tower
on the other side of the glacier. I was pessimistic, pointing out that the
weather had changed, and we could end up hiking out Bachelor Creek in the rain
if we stayed overlong. He left the decision to me. Of course, as we descended
the glacier, my feet strayed to what was true and right - to Dynaflow Tower!
So what if we get wet later, climbing such a neat looking crag would be worth
it!


Theron put me on belay right off the snow, and I swarmed up excellent granite
flakes and cracks to a good belay stance. After Theron arrived, he belayed
me around a corner where the rock changed dramatically. The gray granite
was replaced with rotten, black and brown boulders and shards barely sticking
to the crag. I tried climbing straight up some shards, then realized the
folly of that approach. A devious traverse across the time bomb led to
steep but more solid ground. Then I traversed back right to reach a
notch where I could set a primitive belay. It was hard to trust anything.
My "anchor" was a nut looped back on itself around a column of rock.
I marvelled once again at "Beckey 4th class," remembering that I had made a
technical "drop knee" move on the steep pitch. I rated it 5.6 R, at least
in hiking boots.


I hadn't noticed, but Theron did notice that the wind had picked up and we
were sheathed in cloud. He had opportunity to wonder if I was ok out of
sight and around a corner, moving so slowly for so long. He understood after
following the pitch!


<br><br><center>

<i>Taken from the summit...very loose!</i><br></center>



The last pitch was more of the same, making up for being less steep by presenting
even looser rock for climbing. I tossed 10-15 dangerously stacked shards of
rock off the north side of the peak, and the lonely sound of their crashing
below seemed to take a long time to be heard. I got one nut in, but it was
only psychological protection. The summit was a rotten shard of dark gray
in a light gray cloud world. "Ugh," I thought. We were glad to have done
the climb, but had probably never seen a peak that has such a dramatic
change in rock quality, luring you upward into a jigsaw puzzle!


Getting down was odd. We left a sling at our belay below the summit,
and I rappelled straight down, hoping for some kind of anchor or stance
on the unknown face. As I neared the end of the rope, I saw a tiny
stance with a chock stone I could sling for an anchor. The only problem was
that I had to stand on the chock stone, and be at the end of the rope too.
Very awkward for getting a sling around something! I girth-hitched the
chock stone, and clipped into it to make a bouldering move down to a lower 
stance. From here, I realized I could scramble 4th class ledges back to
the start of the route. So it turned out to require 1 rappel, then a
self-belayed short downclimb to 4th class terrain.


On the glacier, we entered a sea of fog. We left our tracks and turned
hard right, expecting to catch up with our ascent tracks via a shortcut.
We continued without landmark for long enough that I began to worry we
were walking in circles on the flat glacier, but then we found the
tracks. The trip back to camp was long but uneventful. The cloud had
settled on the glacier, and we were free of it once on heather slopes
near camp.

At camp we took a blissful nap, waking when we realized the wind was 
picking up and it smelled like rain. Everyone else had left hours
before. We suddenly hurried to pack up to get down to the
lake in case of a storm, which might be unpleasant on the high ridge.


A beautiful but steep hike led us to the lake where we had dinner and
settled in for the night. The basin above the lake looks so amazing, I
stared at it for a long time. There was no rain in the night.

So we hiked up to a pass and 
then descended Bachelor and Downey Creeks. Due to extensive avalanche debris,
we lost the trail in Bachelor Creek, but were able to enter timber on the
right side for a while, then go down and cross the stream and pick up the
trail again on the other side. Now we put on our MP3 players and zoned
out for a few hours. I listened to some of Theron's 1930s radio programs,
such as "The Potters of Firth," and a great one about Cat People living in
a town called Malton. A great quote in a sepulchral voice: 
"The night air of Malton is conducive to sleep."


We reached the car about an hour before we expected to. We were hiking really
fast, fueled by that acid rock the kids are listening to! It was such a
great feeling to have hiked all this way. Oh the memories! 5 peaks,
40 miles, 20000 feet, 6 days. Damn what a great
time. Thanks Theron!
