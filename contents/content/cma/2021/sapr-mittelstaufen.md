A hike in the late afternoon, snowshoes on my back. The forest was covered in wet, melting snow, making
deep pools of water held in place on the trail. The trail was called the "Bartlmahd." Shortly below
the summit, a young man ate soup and prepared to bed down for the night. After slogging through deep
snow, it was interesting that the final steep way to the summit was snowfree. Gorgeous sunset views
to the Chiemsee.

I was able to avoid using a headlamp all the way until the last few minutes of the trail.
