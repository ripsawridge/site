* September, 2000

It was a beautiful day. I tried to figure out where to go for a hike,
and suddenly remembered Mt. Rainier: "The place I never go to." I
think it all started when I flew up here for an interview back in
1996. It was my first visit to the area, and I was really excited to
see Mt. Rainier. Of course, the month was November, and those of you
who live around here know that's the month for chores, shopping,
reading and working! You have almost 0 chance of seeing the sun in the
mountains.  I drove the Carbon River Road to the mountain, and was
stopped in a dismal logging area by a gate across the road. I ended up
wandering aimlessly in light snow on logging roads, finally crossing a
clear-cut for variety. On hands and knees, I clambered over iced up
branches and brambles. It took 45 minutes to travel about 1000
horizontal feet! What was I doing?!? I drove back to the city, and did
poorly at the job interview. What a dark and dreary place! I
thought. I finally moved here two years later. But only now, 4 years
later did I venture back to the north side of Mt. Rainer.

I'd missed quite a lot in that time. \index{Spray Park}
Spray Park is very beautiful, and
the gentle nature of the terrain there contrasts with the rugged
Mountain in a special way.  In the parking lot, a guy introduced
himself and asked to hike together.  We had an enjoyable if somewhat
frustrating conversation for the first several miles of "boring
forest," which made the time go by quickly. He took a very dim view of
the company where I work, and perhaps insinuated that the only reason
I didn't agree was that I wasn't old or smart enough to know
better. Several times I just wished he would disappear! Finally, the
scenery compelled us to lay our differences aside and talk only about
the surroundings, which was more fun!  We made our way through grass
and heather to pumice and snowfields, angling towards the prominent
point Echo Rock. We surprised a troupe of ptarmigans, who just made
clucking noises, not truly alarmed.


At a high point we parted ways, as he wasn't prepared for steeper snow.
I put on crampons and hiked the icy slopes to the base of 
Observation
Rock. Free of the rather thorny companionship, I felt free and strong
under the sun. Moving quickly, I came to a scree ridge, removed crampons
and made the final hike to the summit. There was a short scramble section
at the very end, on fairly solid basalt. I ate some lunch and admired
the Mountain, thinking that a climb of Ptarmigan Ridge wouldn't be so
bad. The glaciers were very broken, corrupted by too much good weather.


I decided to ramble back a different way, wanting to get a closer look
at the glacier to the west. I was sure I could navigate back to the
trail through the mostly gentle Flett Glaciers.


Coming down from the summit, I headed straight down a scree slope about
300 feet into a basin, then crossed snow to the west, finally coming
to a dramatic overlook of an icefall. Here I turned right and headed
down a ridge back towards Spray Park. When a steep, icy glacier on my
right leveled off a bit, I walked onto it just below the only obvious
crevasse. Walking down steeper slopes, I eventually came to a dirty-looking
unnamed lake. I paused to remove crampons, then continued on snow and rock
to gradually friendlier terrain. I decided to climb Hessog Rock, which was
directly in front of me across Spray Park. A way trail led me through tarns
to the main trail, where a small family sat on a rock admiring Rainier.
I spoke to the father, but with a high shriek, he gathered wife and child
and scurried to the underbrush.


Soon I was climbing again on steep switchbacks on a grassy slope. I came to
a saddle with snow, then followed my nose westward for the summit. Hessog
Rock is a series of basalt cliff towers which look quite rotten. Going around
the back, I followed a way trail through rock, snow, brush and tree-limb
to the summit. This was an excellent viewpoint, really the best in a long day
of excellent views. The whole progression from deep forest, to alpine parkland,
to snow-dappled moraines, to permanent glacial ice was laid out like a
triptych. Add a few peasants and Bosch-like devils for a very mystical vision.


Well, I supposed it was time for my ramble to come to an end, so I reluctantly
pieced my way down to the saddle, then back to the main trail. The descent
went quickly, until I came to the long almost-level portion of the trail.
This felt pretty tedious, but finally I reached the parking lot.


Only a month later, this entire area was covered in snow, although the road was
still drivable.
