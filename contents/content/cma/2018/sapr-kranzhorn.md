Barbara and I hiked up Kranzhorn really quickly. But I got a headache, probably dehydrated
from the day on the Martinswand Saturday with Vaclav. And she pushed herself too hard in
the last hundred meters and felt bad. We sped down the steep trail, and poor Barbara had
such leg pain that she was even limping! _Arme Frau!_ Ach. My headache was terrible.
What a tough time!
