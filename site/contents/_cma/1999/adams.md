September 4-5, 1999

Dudley and Joe, two friends from Texas 
were visiting, and wanted to get
onto a high mountain out here. Their mountains are 30 feet high, and very,
very technical. So we went the other way: a beautiful walk-up route on
a grand volcano.


Joey came along too, for his first mountain climb. His equipment was a
rag-tag assemblage of extra stuff we had. He rode the bus from the U
district Friday evening, and after a Thai dinner, we headed out to
camp at the trailhead, 4 long hours away.


We stopped at a bizarre supermarket that had seen better days. It kind
of characterized the endless sprawl you fight through getting out of
Tacoma. Finally, we attained the darkened roads, talking or sleeping
until 2 am, then crawling into our sleeping bags under a clear, starry
sky.


Steve drove up at 8:01 am, 1 minute late by my watch. Boy, was I surprised!
I had been bragging that he was extremely punctual, no matter how many
uncertain miles and roads he had to travel. To let me down like that...


The five of us sorted gear, and I had a minor panic attack when I thought
I left Joey's harness at home. But I didn't. Then I had another, worse
attack when I thought I left my boots at home.


I did.


A black despair weakened me, and I flopped onto the dirt. Finally, we worked
out a plan where Dudley would give me his Gore Tex hikers when/if he
changes into his plastic boots. Until, then I would wear sneakers. I checked
to see if the hikers would take crampons, and they did. Okay, all is well!



We hiked the easy trail, attaining High Camp within a few hours. We continued
on another 700 feet or so to an excellent camp at the toe of the broken
Adams Glacier. There was a lake for water, and a sturdy-walled bivy site.
We set up the tent, and headed up a snowfield for some snow practice.
Everybody got a chance to try out crampons for the first time, and we made
a small bollard (a teardropped-shaped cutout in the snow that holds
a rope) that was very strong - none of us could break it.


Joey and I walked near the edge of crevasses on the Adams Glacier, then returned
to camp and began preparing dinner. Steve was the main chef, running the
two stoves like an engineer from a stout seat in the corner. Soon, we all
had enjoyed a hot meal of cheese and cous-cous. The light started to fail,
and a cloud-cap over the mountain waxed and waned. We set alarms to get
up at 2:30 am.


We rose on time, and were crunching up the 
snow, then rock to the start of the
route. Joey and I had tennis shoes on. We got on the ridge before daylight,
so we huddled there for about 30 minutes to let the sky lighten in the east.
We could see another party steaming up far, far below by the light of their
headlamps.

With a bit of light, we felt ready to tackle the exposed scrambling required
to continue. These moves were very easy, but dramatic with the Lava Glacier
far below. We kept climbing, over rock, through tiny pebbles of scree, along
steep trails and ridgetops. As we continued, the wind worsened, and the 
clouds came in from the west. Soon, everything below was blocked by an
ocean of cloud. And higher up, fast moving clouds blocked the summit.


After some time, we entered this higher cloud, and the wind became tremendous!
It tried to blow us over, and it was very fast and cold. Finally, we stopped
and huddled in some rocks, planning to wait and see if conditions improved.
Growing chillier, Joey and I headed up to a higher spur, hoping to catch
a glimpse of more promising shelter. Joey turned back, but just above I
found a spot in the sun, almost warm, and protected from the wind! I also
saw that the steepness leveled off, and the rest of the climb would be
a hands-in-pockets ascent.


Heartened by this news, my companions joined me, and we pressed on, making
good time on the easier ground. We gained 1000 feet this way, but alas, the
wind became stronger, and we couldn't see a thing. We were above 11,000 feet,
so close to the summit (an hour's walk?) but forced to turn around.


The other party approached us, and decided to do whatever we did. They
seemed happy with our decision to turn around. Joe and I zoomed out in
front, skiing down the scree in long sliding steps. The ridge was easy
to descend, but we still had 2 or 3 spots that puzzled us temporarily.
We always found the way through, though, and our companions followed.
Joe took a slip on icy rock and snow, but quickly self-arrested. 
The wind and cloud worsened, spraying us with moisture that froze on
our jackets.


Off the ridge, we plodded down to camp. I tried to glissade
the low angle snow, but couldn't get my snow pants on. My feet were
wet in the now-trashed and dirty sneakers, and I looked forward to getting
to camp and dry socks.


Once there, despite my best efforts to nap, everyone wanted to clear out.
The wind strengthened, and the first drops of rain got me moving. We
worked fast and hard, soon trudging down the snowfields to regular trail.


I fell behind the group, not ready to leave the beautiful meadows we
passed through. After a rest stop in a boulder strewn meadow, looking
back at the excellent mountain, I was satisfied. Dudley and I zoomed
down 3 miles without looking back or stopping. At the cars, we said
goodbye to Steve, who drove a different way back to Portland. For the
rest of us, burgers at a brew pub, and the long drive home. Even that
was fun, with saltine-cracker-eating contests and other great ways
to pass the time!


I want to thank Dudley, Joe, Joey and Steve for a great time!
