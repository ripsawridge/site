### Hiking near Wendelstein
_March 28, 2021_

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up in snow from the parking lot to a summit. Really great.

### Bike ride to the southeast
_March 27, 2021_

[Here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/336107425) is the tour on komoot. 81 kilometers, about a 1000 meters up and down.
Really fun...very long and beautiful, too.

### Osterfelderkopf
_March 25, 2021_

Skied up from the Hausberg parking lot. First time to ski this year. Happily, my foot is okay
in the boot, if a little tight.

### Heuberg
_March 13, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up on a beautiful day.

### Wildbarren
_March 6, 2021_

With Jong on a snowy day.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

Night hike to the summit and back.

### Wildbarren

Wonderful day, up steeply and down the secondary way to the same trailhead.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

With Barbara and a small dog -- much fun!

### Wildbarren

Up steeply, but this time traversing around to the west and the dramatic sub-summit.
From there, the ridge is easily followed (game trail?) to join the trail to the summit near the small pretend-chapel.
Down the secondary steep way. Difficult, muddy time in the forest on steep, icy slope with ice under leaves.

### Heuberg

Night hike to the summit and back, thence to sleep in mountains.

### Kranzhorn (partial)
_February 7, 2021_

I hiked up on the german side of Kranzhorn. Very interesting trails!

### Heuberg
_February 6, 2021_

Barbara and I enjoyed a great spring-like day.

### Sulzberg
_February 2, 2021_

A great hike up and down.
