Steve, Chris and I hiked up to Colchuck Lake, thinking to climb the North
Buttress Colouir route on Colchuck Peak. But Steve's ankle was injured, and he
turned back. Chris and I kept going, but gave up on the route due to the great
heat and sugary snow. We continued up the glacier and climbed Pandora's Box. We
would have continued on to Dragontail's summit, but we ran out of time. Mostly
because I'm a slowpoke!
