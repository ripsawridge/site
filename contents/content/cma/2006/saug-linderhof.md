### Linderhof hike
_August 15, 2006_

I hiked up a road above the Linderhof castle to reach the ridge crest and a
hut. Then a muddy hike up the Brannenkopf showed great views of the Große
Klammspitz. What a cool technical ridge top I was on! Unfortunately, it looked
too fragile to climb ethically. There was grass growing on extremely steep
smooth slopes, and the passage of a climber would be visible. There was also a
question of adequate anchors. Back down to the hut, and then a jog along trail
on the south side of the ridge to reach switchbacks below the Große Klammspitz.
Fun scrambling gained the peak and I could really admire the surrounding peaks
from this high point (almost 2000 meters). The Ammergau Alps are really
beautiful!

Now I traveled the ridge crest down to the west, sometimes using my hands and
being very careful on the steep trail. Two more small summits were gained, then
I followed the most slippery, muddy trail I've ever seen (well, maybe the Tiger
Mountain Cable Line trail during a rainstorm) down to a saddle, signed as part
of the "Via Alpina" trans-Alp trail. From here I walked and jogged down to a
road, on which I twisted my foot rather painfully. I had to walk slowly out the
rest of the way. Car to car time: 4:30. This is a really special place, I liked
it a lot! Sorry, no pictures on this better-than-expected day (I thought I'd be
in rain).
