## May 12, day 22 - 24.3 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day22.jpg %}
Finally, after 22 days, real high mountain country!

Eager for Mount Taylor, I started walking before dawn. I bypassed downtown
on side streets, and ended up on a highway beside a prison. A sign warned
not to pick up hitch-hikers here!

Eventually I reached a trailhead and found some water. A car drove up and
dropped off an interesting young man, called Info. He said he had slept in
every time zone in the USA in the last week, because of the demands of a
wedding and an unfortunate dental disaster that required surgery. He'd planned
to start the trail at the Mexican border weeks before, but the hospital and
the wedding took precedence. He is a cook from Seattle.

I started off uphill, but he soon passed me.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04029.jpg %}
Early in the morning, leaving the big city for Mount Taylor.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04033.jpg %}
Looking down on the thriving little town.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04035.jpg %}
Mount Taylor looks incredibly far away.

Later, I sat beside him and struck up what turned out to be a deep conversation.
What was our initial topic? I think it had something to do with the Alien
films? Oh wait, I remember...it was the interesting use of religion in the
story Dune. I said that I liked this...that it was an unusual twist and
a rich idea to put spirituality above technology in a science-fiction book.

With that we were off and running, and enjoyed ourselves greatly.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04044.jpg %}
Near the summit, looking to the southeast.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04046.jpg %}
On top. The native name is Tsoodazit.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220512_161353~2.jpg %}
Info got this picture of me on Mount Taylor.

On the summit we talked with a day hiker, the first ever seen on these New
Mexico trails! It was windy and a bit cold up here. We turned excitedly to
the north. Soon we were walking with a guy named Uphill. Over the next day
or so, I saw him, but soon was passed by. He's tall, fast, and indeed, you
only see the back of him on uphills!

Later, he got a stress fracture in his foot and had to leave the trail. But
he became a trail angel, and was a real help to Slim and Low Branch north of
the San Juans in Colorado. I'm sure he'll be back next year.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04050.jpg %}
Behind Mount Taylor lies a peak covered in radio towers.

Info marches to camp.

My view north for the next days.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04057.jpg %}
Eating dinner in the high country.

Info and I set up camp in some trees with a great view looking east. We tried
to get shelter from the cold wind, but couldn't do too much. Here I started
thinking about exchanging the tarp for a tent for the first time! I simply
wanted unidirectional wind protection, because even a little bit of wind
coming into your sleeping space steals energy. I slept with the umbrella
expanded and tied down with a rock, and my pack trying to block the other
side of the tarp. Didn't work so well, but I eventually got some sleep.

## May 13, day 23 - 25.7 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day23.jpg %}
A long, long day across fairly flat high divide country.

Info and I got some water after a few miles, then headed north.
Tall Son walked by and said he saw a bear scratching himself on a tree
right where we had camped. The bear saw him, "freaked out" and ran away.

At some point, Info and I
separated, and I walked for many hours alone. We found each other again
in the afternoon, getting water from a tank a bit off the trail.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04061.jpg %}
Info hikes on the long, long plateau.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220513_195417.jpg %}
I look wide awake, but I know for a fact I am tired!

I slept gratefully on the side of the road a few miles before a water source.
The day had been dominated by views out to volcanic plugs down in the desert
below on the west side. On the right was the crest, just a bit higher than me,
and Mount Taylor continually receded but never disappeared.

## May 14, day 24 - 23.5 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day24.jpg %}
Finishing up the high plateau, down to a desert camp.

Rather foolishly, I passed by the water source, because you had to walk almost
a mile down to a creekbed. I decided I could make it to Cerro del Oja Frio
for water, but that was at least 12 miles away and I probably only had one
liter. Though, tired feet and body spoke loudly: only take necessary steps!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220514_113516.jpg %}
A selfie picture, resting under a tree and having finished the last of my water.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220514_121823.jpg %}
Tall Son got this picture of me before dropping to the low country and some
much needed water at the low hill directly above my head.

Tall Son arrived and passed by, and we took some pictures. I guess Info was
ahead because I didn't see him again until the Ghost Ranch. It was interesting
coming down into the desert again...the trail was initially very steep.
Then the land turned light brown and treeless.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04071.jpg %}
The peaks of Cerro Cuate and the imposing Cabezon Peak that dominates views
for the next day as well.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04074.jpg %}
Cerro del Oja Frio which marks my long-awaited water source. Cerro Cuate lurks behind.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04077.jpg %}
The peaks of Bear Mouth on the right and Chavez, higher, marks where I came
down from the high and dry plateau.

At the spring, I planned to hang out a good long time. I rigged up my pack
into a kind of couch, drank water like a camel, and ate peanut butter and
tortillas. Tall Son hung out a while, and Lemonhope came along. I hadn't seen
him since...wow...Doc Campbell's Post.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04087.jpg %}
Colorful rocks of the Mesa San Luis.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04089.jpg %}
Lemonhope wears a crown of thorns. His idea was to walk to the Pacific Ocean
and throw it in. He could have done it, too!

I walked down into the Arroyo Chico, a low, winding desert canyon. Soon I
was climbing up the other side onto the Mesa San Luis. Lemonhope caught me
while I rested a while and sat with me with a crown of thorns on his head.
He is irreverent like that! We continued to a campsite with a glorious
view, poised for a day of wandering canyon rims.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04094.jpg %}
Looking down from camp on the Sante Fe Trail.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04098.jpg %}
A beautiful night...

## May 15, day 25 - 24.8 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day25.jpg %}
A hot and tiring day in the desert, but beautiful and interesting country too.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04107.jpg %}
Good morning, Cabezon!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04120.jpg %}
Broad views to highway 550 and the Sante Fe National Forest behind.

The mid-morning was marked by a water cache that I appreciated so much.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220515_085840.jpg %}
An amazing, and completely necessary water cache!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220515_085920.jpg %}
Many notices of thanks for the water cache.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220515_085932.jpg %}
More notices...

Canyon country.

I felt deep gratitude in these hot canyons and ridges, and wrote an entry
"[Epiphanies](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/epiphanies.html)" on the blog. It's probably one of the more interesting things
I managed to write down for the whole trip. Here it is:

Yeah. So it is!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04118.jpg %}
With interesting layers...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220515_144215.jpg %}
Somewhere in the hot afternoon, taking refuge on the side of the trail in
some shade.

In the late afternoon, I came down into Jones Canyon, where there is a spring,
marked on USGS topo maps as "Spring (polluted)." Ha! I didn't care about that.
I, and everyone else here just needed the water really badly. It was the
hottest, thirstiest day on the trail since the first week. In fact, some
of the people laying about in bits of shade here seemed victims of heat
exhaustion. I was pretty okay, having sat at the trail angels cache and drank
plenty so I left it well-hydrated in the morning. Others, probably much better
people than I, had resolved not to take too much water, so they suffered more
crossing the canyons. Hmm. My thought is this: there were an enormous number
of jugs at the cache, and it is easily supplied by road. This is the high
season of the trail (probably a 2-3 week stretch of time at the most). And
that means the trail angel is extremely aware of the state of the cache,
probably visiting daily. I think they'd want us to use it to stay healthy!

Without that cache, I think we'd had to take some different route, somehow.

After some joking good times with people at the spring, I walked across a
hardpan desert floor, with an imposing mesa looming above. My job was to
climb up onto that and camp. It's called *Mesa Portales*. It was getting
dark as I climbed, and it was a kind of dramatic journey. The colors were
beautiful, and I was often unsure of where the trail would go. I finally got
up the 500 foot climb and found a wind-protected place to set up my tarp.

I wandered back to the rim and looked at the beautiful moon in a cold blue
desert. I was waiting for Lemonhope. Sure enough, he came up over the rim and
sat for a while with me.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04125.jpg %}
I'm up on the mesa after crossing the country below.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220515_203524~2.jpg %}
Before sleep, I sat out under the moon and waited for Lemonhope to hike up.

## May 16, day 26 - 16.9 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day26.jpg %}
A walk along the canyon rim to low country and roads to Cuba, then back up to
a camp by a stream.

I woke to a smoky sky. Lemonhope was already gone. I wandered down along the
rim, then into a broad hardpan and finally a road.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04130.jpg %}
In the morning, smoke from the east.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04132.jpg %}
Interesting trails...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04131.jpg %}
A smoky walk to Cuba.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220516_070037.jpg %}
A smoky morning, but Cuba is not far away.

In Cuba I met Katherine, last seen in Grants. She was waiting for a motel to
open. I went and got some delicious country breakfast with Google and Lemonhope.
Google was keen to take a bus to Albequerque for a while because he heard
they would close the forests soon. This got Lemonhope excited to take off
right soon and get into the forest. I felt the same, so we first went over
to the Forest Service office and inquired what they had to say about closing.
The woman inside said they planned to meet in two days to think about closing
the forest. That would give us time to get to near Ghost Ranch anyway.

So we stocked up in the supermarket, then visited Taco Bell for a last meal and
to charge the phones. No time for laundry, here. I met Shotgun and Critter
in Taco Bell, last seen in the country south of Mangas Mountain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220516_162228.jpg %}
Lemonhope walking to our camp at the base of the mountains.

Lemonhope and I walked to a camp by a stream hard below a steep climb up into
unusually green mountains.

## May 17, day 27 - 23.2 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day27.jpg %}
A day of real alpine "parkland."

I started out first, and enjoyed the climbing in the chilly air.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220517_055415.jpg %}
Morning above our camp at the base of the mountains.


Now this was the most alpine forest so far, putting the previous high islands
of Burro Mountain and Mount Taylor to shame. It was a parkland. There were
snow patches in the forest, sometimes rather annoying ones!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220517_083215~2.jpg %}
By the San Grigorio Reservoir.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220517_094532.jpg %}
First snow of the trip!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04137.jpg %}
Lemonhope in the San Pedro Peaks Wilderness.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04139.jpg %}
Real parkland, which felt amazing to walk in.

The country finally reached a high point of about 10500 feet in the San
Pedro Peaks Wilderness. After this, a long descent to Cecilia Spring, where
I rested tired feet and joked with Shotgun, Critter and Lemonhope. Critter
thought that one of us must have surely littered somewhere along the way.
If I recall correctly, my response was to drop innocent little anecdotes
which included some shocking detail about how I defiled some wild country
either with litter or some kind of inappropriate eliminatory function.
But she was sharp, and caught herself just before reflexively delivering
a lecture! This is actually the most fun...to try and "wind someone up,"
having sussed their proclivities, and hoping to lure them into the unthinking
delivery of a lecture to the foolish babes around them!

Hee hee, I did succeed in getting Mishap to do that a few times, later on!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04141.jpg %}
A hiker in the parks...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220517_110054~2.jpg %}
Lemonhope in high country.

The three of them continued, but my feet had enough and so at the first
wide, flat spots in open forest, I hove off to camp in the trees.

## May 18, day 28 - 19 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day28.jpg %}
Coming down, then up into parkland again, then back down to desert and a
mighty river.

I came down from my camp and crossed highway 96. People on the Guthooks app
had complained about wild dogs along that road. I didn't see any.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_061735~2.jpg %}
Greenery in the forest at 6:15 in the morning.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_081557.jpg %}
I liked this widely-spaced forest country.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_082248.jpg %}
In the Mesa Alta.

There was a 1000-foot climb to get up onto the next forest park plateau,
which I enjoyed. Up there, I saved a mile or so by switching to some
forest tracks to avoid a pointless roundabout on the official trail. I got
water from a tank guarded by cows.

After a few miles along a dirt road going north, I turned off to follow the
trail steeply down into Ojitos Canyon. It was an interesting place. I was
in *extremely* narrow little gullies, wide enough for two people to travel
abreast, but also choked with ping trees, usually scarred by fire.

In fact there was no wind in here, it was quite hot. I could easily imagine
fire snaking through these canyons. Sometimes there were little streams or
pools, and I had to walk through them (they were not deep enough to make my
feet wet), making tight little turns in the labyrinth.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_110436~2.jpg %}
Lunchtime on the forest floor.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04145.jpg %}
Coming down into the Chama River country.

After a long rest in the forest I came out to a spring and desert country.
I met a cowboy who asked if I'd seen any cows up in there. I said no, not since
the cows many miles back and much higher in the parkland. He said that when
water becomes scarce, the cows spread out and end up in all kinds of strange
places. He'd been looking for two days, and would go on looking.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_130439.jpg %}
This is the first time I saw such a mighty river on the trip.

I came to the Chama River at the Skull Bridge. I simply couldn't bring myself
to make it a 30 mile day and reach Ghost Ranch tonight...the feet hurt too much.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220518_182819.jpg %}
Evening, bathing in the river.

So I decided to call it quits early and set up in an official campground for
probably the only time on the whole trail. There was no one around. I could
take a bath in the cold water, which nicely offset the hot sun.

## May 19, day 29 - 11 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day29.jpg %}
A short day, from the river to the Ghost Ranch.

It was a nice walk in the morning. I knew I was risking having to leave the trail
by not hurrying through the night before. But quality is more important than
quantity. Having a bath in the river and ending the day well yesterday was
worthwhile.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04146.jpg %}
The Ghost Ranch country.

After a couple hours of walking, I was able to go across country and down to
the highway in order to save a couple miles. I ended up at a strange
abandoned amusement park, and followed a twisty path across rusted bridges
and through at least one abandoned building to reach a trail snaking off behind
the rusted structures that led to the Ghost Ranch, again, saving at least a
mile of road walking. Very interesting!

I arrived to find an artists retreat, with lots of clean well-dressed people
who looked very important. But taped to the front desk was a sad piece of
paper:

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220519_092042.jpg %}
The heartbreaking letter that meant I couldn't finish the walk through New
Mexico.

Lemonhope had just got into the forest the night before,
so his urgency paid off. We knew that this region wasn't in danger, they were
just closing all forests in the state. Oh well, at least I got to hike in
the San Pedro Peaks country, which was delightful.

From [the blog](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/well-shucks.html):

"The Jesus" is an extremely strong hiker,
who later did some trail magic deep in the Southern San Juans when people were
limping out after snowstorms just before my walk there.

## May 20, day 30 - 0 miles

And so began a week off the trail in Chama. Resting for Colorado!
I moved into an AirBNB.

You can see a new sleeping pad on the left for the snowy ground of Colorado.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220520_172115.jpg %}
I ate well every night.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220521_094834.jpg %}
My place in Chama. It was hard to leave!

At one point in Chama I wrote a book review for the *Tao of Piglet*, a charming
little book I liked very much!

A wonderful dinner with my hosts in Chama.
