## The Man who was Thursday

An [incredible book](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Thursday-Biographical-Introduction-ebook/dp/B000FC1CSW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+man+who+was+thursday&qid=1607443736&sr=8-1) by G. K. Chesterton.
I loved the ending. It dragged a bit in the middle with all the descriptions of running, fleeing, etc.
But it's worth getting through that to the glorious banquet at the end:

> "You!" he cried. "You never hated because you never lived. I know what you are all of you,
> from first to last--you are the people in power!...You are the Law and you have never been
> broken...We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that
> crime of the Government. It is all folly! The only crime of the Government is that it
> governs...I do not curse you for being cruel. I do not curse you (though I might) for
> being kind. I curse you for being safe!"

And Syme, the poet, the Sun and the Moon answers Satan hotly:

> "I see everything," he cried, "everything that there is. Why does each thing on the earth
> war against each other thing?...Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe? For
> the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of Days. So that each thing
> that obeys law may have the glory and the isolation of the anarchist. So that each man
> fighting for order may be as brave as the dynamiter."

And later:

> "It is not true that we have never been broken. We have been broken upon the wheel."

## Hermann Hesse

I read Damien and was blown away.

## C. S. Lewis

How can I stop singing the praises of "Til We Have Faces?" Or of the sci-fi trilogy? However, I still have to read the third book.

## Old movie day

I watched [the Verdict](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/verdict/) with Paul Newman (1982), then
[Fury](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1035061_fury?) with Spencer Tracy (1936). So sue
me, I was in a courtroom drama mood!

The Verdict was great in showing how good it is to work hard, days and nights, when it's for
something you really believe in. And I loved the ending (spoiler). The scene of 
Charlotte Rampling, drunk and morally devastated in her hotel room, calling and calling
seems an effective image to consider where your choices may lead. Why wasn't there a sequel,
hmm?

The neat thing about Fury is that it really seems like an educational film made at a time
when lynchings were common (or maybe 10 years after). The long scenes of sorrowful faces in
the dock and the agonized keening of one townswoman torn apart by guilt appeared heavy-handed
in my day, a couple of lifetimes later. But Spencer Tracy is always fun to watch, and Sylvia
Sidney is beautiful and expressive.

## Those Grey Eyes

I've been very inspired by Bill Vencil's YouTube videos on ambient guitar playing.
I recorded one of his songs, "[Those Grey Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMjKv_DUE0)," with my new Alvarez Baritone Guitar. The picture is of Barbara last fall in the Dolomites,
she is so beautiful. Her eyes are a lovely deep brown, and I'm sure Bill will forgive
me for thinking of *those* eyes while I play his song...

## Eating Christmas in the Kalahari

I just finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227265.Ishmael">Ishmael</a>, a beautiful book. 
I found my way from there to a wonderful essay, 
"<a href="https://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/ANTH101/EatingChristmas-Lee.pdf">Eating Christmas in the Kalahari</a>," (PDF link) which 
has much to say about how a group of people can protect themselves against ego and arrogance.
	
## Stars and Fire

I made this song after acquiring a TC Flashback Triple Delay pedal.
There is one guitar part, in which I used an infinite delay to create a drone to
solo over. Later, I added an organ for some bass and a few wispy synth notes in Logic Pro.
