### Setzberg hike
<i>May 8, 2011</i>

Mother's Day! But I needed exercise too, so I got up early and hiked up Setzberg. Just shy of 3000 feet (897 meters by Google Earth) elevation gain to the top, it took me an hour and 10 minutes. Great views of the Karwendel north walls up there. My pace was ~2500 feet/hour. 2 hours car to car with a blissful 10 minutes on top.
