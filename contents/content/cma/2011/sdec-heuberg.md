### Heuberg ski
<i>December 26, 2011</i>

I went for a morning ski to a peak I'd never visited. Heuberg is in the "tame Kaiser," near the Pyramidanspitze. You start from a road above the Walchsee. It was a great couple of hours, and I had an excellent view from the summit.

The skiing down was really pleasant, for the first trip of the year. I had such a good time I needed to get back out a few days later...
