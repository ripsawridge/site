Since moving out of the city I'd wanted to walk through the local
forest, which impressed me very much. I've since learned it's the
largest forest in the flat-lands of Germany ([wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebersberger_Forst)). 90 square kilometers without any homes, 77 square kilometers of
which belongs to the state. Here is an interesting note:

> Dies zeigt sich auch sprachlich in den lokalen Bezeichnungen für die
> Landkreisbewohner süd-östlich („Innerhoizer“) und nordwestlich des
> Forstes („Draußerhoizer“), jeweils aus Sicht der Kreisstadt Ebersberg.

This makes sense to me...now having walked through to the broad, crisp view
of mountains from the heights above Ebersberg. They are "inside," nestled between
the forest and mountains to the south. How strange, these Draußerhoizer must
have seemed. Now of course, with cars, such interesting distinctions tend
to be forgotten.

I was inclined to be upset at the grid-pattern of roads through the forest,
but I suppose it gets a pass due to antiquity alone. Below is a map from
1866, and things are exactly the same ([wikipedia link](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebersberger_Forst#/media/File:Urpositionsblaetter_Bayern_blatt_695.jpg)):

In fact the *Geräumte* paths were made in the middle of the 18th century.
This makes sense: science, and it's vision of solving complexity through subdivision
was taking it's grip on minds. I experience the grid as a kind of violence.
I should have sympathy though. Nature then was bigger, and threatened to overwhelm.
If you feel *that way*, you might take comfort in a grid that pins down the untamed
in place.

There is even a ghost story - the "*weisse Frau*" who long haunted the road between
Markt Schwaben and Ebersberg. Drivers would notice a light in the little
*Hubertus Kapelle* on the side of the road. If they stopped it would again be
dark, or, worse, they may see her. I'm sure someone came for her in the end, though.

I set out immediately crestfallen because I found that my trusty old compass was broken.
Drat! My goal was to follow a bearing across the forest ignoring the roads. However,
I rode my bike to the local sporting goods store, and believe it or not they still had
a *compass*, that archaic and forgotten device. Actually they had two. Now only one -
*so hurry!*

I made the 5 kilometer bike ride to the parking lot at Schwaberwegen. Using my map,
I composed a bearing of slightly more south than east, making for the *Forsthaus
St. Hubertus*, and then to the *Ludwighöhe* beyond. I dialed this into the compass,
and resolved to check my progress after an hours walk by checking the gps in my
phone. Yes, I'm a bit of a baby, but *one with aspirations!*

My bearing for 2 hours


For the first half hour I was not enjoying the forest floor very much. Continually
bent forward under branches, in and out of brushy copses, with a never-ending
series of bulldozer tracks, brambles, sticks. Through "trackless" forest I wanted
to go, but the whole place appeared to have been the playground of demons with
power machinery for 50 years. I guess that's pretty much the truth? I grimaced --
never before had the term "working forest" seemed so much like the term "working girl."
Behind each muddy track I saw the ill-formed desires of people surrounding the
forest. "WANT!" they screamed, and so some poor schlub started up his diesel-fueled
device and extracted some shareholder value from the nearby forest. Sigh.

However, the forest is big enough to suffer without being wholly beaten.
Eventually I came to taller trees, with moss on the ground. I could walk tall again and
see further. Travel by compass is easier when you can navigate by a sight in the
middle or far distance. I practiced my ability to hold a clear mental vision,
losing sight of the oddly leaning tree or snowpatch that was my next destination,
and remaking it in my mind with slightly different angles and lighting...how it
might look when I arrive 40 seconds later. I was continually watched by hunter
stands, "thrones" for the lords of the forest. As for people there was, of course,
no one.

Finally on a trail


I checked my phone after an hour, and was about where I expected to be. Cool! In the next
hour I just missed a large clearing on the west side, and turned out to be due west
of the *Forsthaus* by probably 15 minutes. I adjusted my bearing to move more eastward,
then came to beautiful hills in the forest. At some point a collection of wild boars
silently fled my approach to the west. At the end of 2.5 hours, I was in the hilly
southern part of the forest near the Egglburger See. I turned on the gps to track
the rest of the day, and really enjoyed this southern upland. As usual, hills protect
nature from human interference.

I ate my lunch at a "meditation bench" just below the *Ludwigshöhe*. The view of mountains
was fantastic. The Wilder Kaiser Range in particular looked great from here.

I went up the lookout tower, my legs tired from the long walk. I followed a hikers trail
(well marked) to the Forsthaus Hubertus 5 kilometers distant -- this was very enjoyable.
I'd like to run this trail later. The Haus was in it's "winter sleep" according to a sign
posted near the door.

From here I went due west into a special wildlife reserve. The trail was still asthetically
pleasing, and deep glimpses into forest mystery were always possible. I listened to
"Humidity," Robert Rich's ode to organic growth on faraway planets. Or maybe on lonely
biological outcroppings deep within -- hard to tell!

Finally though I had to pay the piper for the long and fascinating walk with the traversal
of 4 kilometers of deadly-boring straight road on tired legs. Back to my bike, then
riding home as the rain began.

It was about 25 kilometers of walking through the forest, 10 kilometers on the bike.
Elevation gain about 400 meters overall. I started walking at 11 am, and was on the
return journey at about 2:30. I reached my bike at 5 pm.
