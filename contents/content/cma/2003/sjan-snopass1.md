<h3>Skiing at Snoqualmie Pass</h3>

I had a few hours before a big storm came in, so I dusted off my skis and headed to the
Pass. I parked at the "Silver Fir" chairlift, and skinned up, soon reaching "Grand Junction."
I took the trail "Ripsaw" to reach Windy Pass on the west side of Mt. Catherine. This was the
best part of the trip: mostly downhill, with great views to McClellan's Butte, Granite Mountain,
and Snoqualmie Peak. Gradually clouds obscured all of these mountains. I coasted for miles down
the road on the south side of Mt. Catherine, then got bored on the flat terrain. I went up a 
road that was taking me back up to the plateau (Serpentine loop?) for a ways, then skied back
down. Now it started to snow heavy, wet flakes. My right binding started acting up, and I lost
all gliding ability. I reached the Nordic Center, then walked the road for a mile back to my
car - soaking wet. Happy New Year!
