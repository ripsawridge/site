### Langfenn

_April 22, 2019_

From the Burgerhof again, I jogged and walked up to Flaas by the steepest way, then to the Schermoossattel
(1450 m). Jogging up the hill to Langfenn, I couldn't resist climbing a few meters up the stony tower.
It seemed possible to reach the summit of the tower if I could be given a top-rope for safety!
From here I descended to the now-familiar Tomagen Restauarant, then a bit further south after
a piece of cake to a ridiculously steep trail down through the forest leading to the road cut
from Jenesien to Afing. An indication of a bridge and trail on the map proved to be illusory, so I
had to settle for following the long road up directly along the Afinger Bach to the retaining pond
below the Burgerhof, then tiredly up to the Hof itself. About 1000 meters up and down.
