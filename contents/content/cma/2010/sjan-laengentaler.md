### Längentaler Weißer Kogel (attempt)
<b>January, 2010</b>

I skied up the valley to right below the Westfallenhaus, but deteriorating
weather caused me to cancel the long trip further up to the glacier. It was
snowing hard directly in my face. I thought of going up to the Westfallenhaus
but windblown latschen-covered slopes were discouraging.

So instead I went back to the car, then drove over to ski up Zischgeles. After
500 meters of climbing I gave in to lassitude and skied back down. Alas! Total
elevation gain, 1000 meters.
