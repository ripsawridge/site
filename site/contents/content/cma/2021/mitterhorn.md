Fresh off the trip to the Garda Lake with Barbara, I headed back out to the Loferer
Mountains for a day trip. Bad weather would be arriving in late afternoon, and
it was the only chance to get high before country over 2000 meters is covered
in snow that will not melt until next summer.

I began walking before dawn from the little village of Weißleiten, near the
Pillersee, east of Sankt Johann in Tyrol. I soon left forested slopes for harsher
ground of shattered limestone and *latschen,* the low and often annoying shrubs
that mark all journeys in the Northern Limestone Alps.

As the sun rose, I entered a stony valley populated by *gämse*, who treated me
in a relaxed way...moving along ahead without running. I hit a junction where
one could go left for the Mitterhorn. I had a helmet and planned to use the
ladders on the *klettersteig* at every opportunity. In time I was there, and
it's true what they say, the ladders are quite wobbly, and made from a metal
that one worries might well break under the weight of a modern body with
access to rather too much fast food!

Despite lots of shaking, they held up. After this beautiful ascent, I stood on
the summit, admiring the clouds coming in from the west, the Steinplatte below,
and wide views to the Untersberg in the north and snowy peaks of the crests
to the south.

Why not follow the Nurracher Höhenweg down, I thought? It would make the day
much longer, but by gosh, the fall is ending, and I'll be glad I did.
So indeed, I set off back down the ladders until reaching the point where
I could diverge to the west and follow the crest to the next summits.
It was funny, after each descent and rise, I saw that the clouds were a bit
closer. Already, on the Östliche Rothorn, I saw that, aided by the flat
land beneath them, clouds had raced ahead to the Untersberg west of Salzburg,
and were quickly overtaking it's broad *latschen*-slopes on the west, and
spilling over the dramatic cliffs of it's eastern side. While here, deeper
in the range, I seemed to be protected by the difficulty the clouds had
climbing over each mountainous obstacle. I had best hurry.

I skipped the Große Rothorn, moving about 100 meters below it's summit,
intent on climbing the more dramatic Rothörndl (2395 m) which required
some use of hands and offered some cables for protection. There was a
rather long descent back at the saddle between the Rothorn and the
Rothörndl before the route began traversing again, and from the
Schaflegg (2176 m) I was alarmed to see that the clouds had crossed
many kilometers while I looked away, and now were blocked only by the
faltering summit of the Seehorn (Ulrichshorn) (2155 m). Hurrying somewhat,
I traversed snowy ledges and soon entered a cloudbank which gave
my surroundings a rather ominous appearance. I didn't much care for
the frozen snow ledge traverses -- I wondered how far down one might fall!

With chilled hands I finally reached the Heimkehrererkreuz, aka the Ulrichshörndl,
to be met by a young man and his dog. He asked me to take pictures of the two
of them. I was relieved to be finished with technical terrain, as it had begun
to rain by this point. A full thousands meters of descent awaited, and wow, it
felt long and very, very steep. Eventually I emerged from the cloud and saw
the somber terrain of the shadowy Pillersee and it's mournful villages in
the gloom. Truly, winter is beginning.

Once down, I refilled my water (much needed) and made a tiring walk back to
Weißleiten where my car sat. I said hello to a couple who walked by. They were
doing the route in reverse, and we'd seen each other at the Rothorn saddle many
hours before.

Darn, the clouds found me!
