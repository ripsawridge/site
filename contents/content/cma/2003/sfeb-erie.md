<h3>Mount Erie rock climbing 2/15/2003</h3>

Robert Meshew invited Theron, Kris and myself to go climbing at Mt. Erie.
I'd been once before 6 years ago when I learned to rappel on a glacier mountaineering
class. We did a few great climbs (I'll post pictures when I get them).
Robert and Theron did "Tyndell's Terror (5.7)", which I missed. I climbed
two crack climbs to the left of that, finding them both pretty interesting.
(I think one was "Leaning Crack (5.6)", and then "Psycho Crack (5.8)", which
did feel a little psychotic). Kris and I then climbed "Nice and Easy (5.7)", topping
out from the wall. We went and had lunch in town, then came back so Theron,
Robert and I could climb "Zig Zag (5.7)" (Kris drove Theron's nice car and napped
in the sun). Robert led us all over creation
in an exploratory bushwhack (haha!) to reach the base of the route.
It was great 3 pitch climb that started
with a nice right facing corner crack, then a kind of scary pitch above
which climbed a face, then traversed right to a fixed pin, then up to a dead
tree and a belay spot. The final short pitch started with scrambling, then
climbed on juggy holds to the top of the impressive wall. After that, we
found a trail and scrambled ledges to the top of the mountain. Finally,
a few fun pitches at the "main area" as darkness fell for the four of us.
We were dodging the impressively clad and numerous "learning parties" that
took over the upper cliffs all day ("We've a CLIMBER DOWN!!" one said).
One guy was wearing gaiters (why?), and we inadvertently wandered into
their designated urination area once. We had a great time.
