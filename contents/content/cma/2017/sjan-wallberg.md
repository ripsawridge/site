Jaro, Marcel, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg after work. It was very cold,
and we had lots of snow. Fun! Jaro wanted to skin right up the steepest
part of the slope, and we did this (though I lost patience and made a
boot track). Above this initial steep section, the skinning up was perfect.
On top there was a strong wind. There was a beautiful light in the distance,
where a cloud spilled over a ridge with a lighted hut on it.

We really enjoyed the ski down. We saw many parties coming up.
W00t!
