## A Plea from a Heathen

Even the pagans want Christians back at their posts! From a [good article](https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/19/a-plea-from-a-heathen/) by John Conlin:

That is right. Slavery, including sexual slavery was an enormous component
of the pagan world. It was a new Christian idea that our bodies are
outposts of God in the world, and we must treat them with respect...and not
only mine or yours but all the other people's too. Teaching that God is found
within has enormous side effects on our moral thought. It took a very long time,
but much of the planet turned away from slavery. Modern people don't know this
history.

Like the G. K. Chesterton quote: **“When men choose not to believe in God,
they do not thereafter believe in nothing, they then become capable of
believing in anything.”**

> The most fundamental truth that we all are the sons and daughters of God is
> being lost. Christians cannot allow this to continue—you are our last defense.

That last point connects me to the idea of classical education. That kind of
education is centered around the ability to discover and enlarge truth,
virtue and beauty. An education like that needs a God. In that model, there
is a single source from which all good things flow. These things attain
diversity as they flow into creation downstream. Here, you've got room for
the theory of evolution. It does not have to "kill" God. It is just one of
the innumerable expressions of creation, of life, working it's way into
the physical world.

Our modern educational system is all fragments of increasingly distant
"facts." This system may lead to fluency but not wisdom. It is only useful
as a counter-example...what **not to do**!

So I like this pagan, who says, I don't see it as those Christians do, but I
do see that they are onto something, and this something they are on to may
well have played a huge part in making our world. And our world does still
have many good things. The Christians enlarged the good and destroyed much
bad. As they recede, the bad ideas return to sit at the table they were
banished from, and we don't recognize their faces.

## A Collection of Articles Concerning Lust and Self-abuse

By orthodox church fathers, so it's good stuff.
Link [here](http://orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/selfabuse.aspx).

This is one of those things no fun to talk about but I think it is so
serious that the point has to be raised: sexual fantasy is a huge mistake.
Fantasy of any kind is a poor idea. You are taking energy that could be
used to build the thing in reality that you'd like to see, and directing it
to a virtual world, where time spent may not only be useless but counter-productive.

It is like video games. Sitting in front of a game all day, you'll then go
out into the world and feel inadequate. You'll resent all the people getting
on with their lives. You'll wonder why you don't measure up. It's because
you aren't even trying at all!

So fantasy in general is dangerous. Do you have a dream? Okay, spend a moment
imagining its success. Smile. But then get to work bringing it into reality.

Sexual fantasy is particularly BAD. Here are two main reasons:

1. Sexuality occurs in relationship, because another person is involved.
   This is unavoidable. The fantasist may pretend that his imaginary partner
   is a robot or something. But there is still a relationship. It will be
   a master/slave relationship. Question for you: what does it do to your
   kindness and patience in the real relationships of your life, if you spend
   so much time stepping into a world where you are a master? And it is a
   world that you energetically create?
2. The sex drive is so deep and powerful in us, the flows of energy so high,
   that if we are willing to describe any part of the world as magic it must
   be that. After all, the creation of new beings is the result. So...if
   fantasy is to be avoided, then certainly, sex fantasy is doubly bad because
   it's lure is so powerful at the outset, and secondly, it keeps you coming
   back for more fantasy despite the knowledge that it is incorrect.

There are other reasons. Just to mention one more, it goes better for us if we
orient our lives towards our challenges, and not towards our pleasures.
Hope of overcoming a challenge is a more productive driver than hope of some
pleasure.

An old zen monk was asked if he'd rather incarnate into hell or heaven.

"Hell," he said firmly. "I'd get lazy in heaven."

There is truth in that! In fact, the spiritual emptiness of modern society
must have some relation with it's incredible, never-before-seen level of
comfort.

Anyway. The society today likes to say that masturbation is fine, it's great,
just do it, etc. And at the same time, society wrings tears out of its eyes
constantly at the thought of "microaggressions" or any dynamic of slavery,
however much they have to strain to see it. My question back to them is:
how can you encourage people to build private worlds with coercive relationships
in them, and then expect them to hold every relationship with exquisite
sensitivity to what is right? Because fantasy is not about what is right, it
is about what feels good for me.

Above, I talked about a classical education. About starting with goodness at
the top, flowing down into the world where we live. In such a worldview, it
is harder for such silly (and harmful) contradictions to land among us
unexamined. The instructions a culture gives to itself should be in harmony
with the Highest power we can imagine. And fantasy is not in such harmony.
Jesus said that just imagining adultery is as if you have done it. I have
thought long about this, and I have had certain experiences. I am not young.
Those words are true. They are simply correct.

You will find out, if you don't believe it to be so.

## The Karamazov Brothers

I read this book. It was so, so, so good. You should read it, if you haven't!
