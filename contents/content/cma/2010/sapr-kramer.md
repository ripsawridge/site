### Kramerspitz
<b>April 18, 2010</b>

Hiked up the Kramerspitz from town. I took snowshoes, then felt kind of silly
because I hiked up 1000 meters without needing them. Then, they did come in
handy on the back side traverse (lots of snow until June) because the slopes
were frozen with no steps in them. I used the "crampons" of the snowshoes for
purchase. On a slight variation, I just headed up steep snow after the initial
traverse, thinking that would get me to the summit...it was easier than
traversing frozen slopes in snowshoes. But I reached a different summit. Some
down/up got me to the true summit. I went down "the long way," by the hut and
meadow, then back to the nature trail with the long flat boring walk back to
the car. 5:30, 1450 meters.
