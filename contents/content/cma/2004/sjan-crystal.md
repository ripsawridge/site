### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Jan 10, 2004

Bob, Mardi, Kris and I went here for a great day of skiing.
Kris took a lesson and improved her ability. Bob and Mardi
led me down a black diamond run called "Sunshine," that was
fun-slash-scary! Kris and I went down the long "Queens" run
together and I took a detour on the "CMAC" run near the bottom.
Bob and Mardi led me up another chairlift that only had
double-black-diamond runs to get down! We did a long traverse
into a bowl, and headed straight down that. This one was too
steep for me and I crashed a few times. Finally I had to
do kick turns to make it down! A few more blue runs finished
out the day. I was really sore Monday!
