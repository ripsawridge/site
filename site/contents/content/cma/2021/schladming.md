3 weeks post-surgery, I was ready to try out a multi-day hike. I also felt
the end of summer approaching. The Schladminger High Route was a perfect
choice. Not too difficult. It made a loop, so return wouldn't be a hassle.
Also, it was in Austria, where I know I can travel, and which isn't too
far away in case anything goes wrong.

This time, I made a video of the trip. I tried to convey the flavor of
hiking plus yoga and meditation that I like to do. I was reading three
books by Abbot George Burke at once, which were amazing. These are:

* [Soham Yoga: The Yoga of the Self: An In-Depth Guide to Effective Meditation](https://www.amazon.com/Soham-Yoga-Depth-Effective-Meditation-ebook/dp/B07FFBPPT8/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&keywords=abbot+george+burke&qid=1631961304&sr=8-11)
* [Yoga: Science of the Absolute: A Commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali](https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Science-Absolute-Commentary-Patanjali-ebook/dp/B07P1XBMTL/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&keywords=abbot+george+burke&qid=1631961304&sr=8-12)
* [Living the Yoga Life: Perspectives on Yoga](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Yoga-Life-Perspectives-ebook/dp/B09BLKH82Z/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=abbot+george+burke&qid=1631961304&sr=8-5) (Amazon link)

Anyway, I even (in my enthusiasm and at your expense!) read from one of them at one point.
Obviously, I highly recommend all three books. Here's the video:

Special thanks to reader Peter, who pointed out that these are *Grantiger Jäger*
in local dialect of the Salzburg mountains. I looked on Wikipedia and found
[more information](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpen-Kuhschelle) about them.
*Grantiger Jäger* means "grumpy hunter," and this made me laugh. Indeed...these
fellas were worked hard and put away wet. They look like they need a good hot
breakfast!
