### Wallberg
<b>May 29, 2010</b>

An afternoon/evening hike up Wallberg. I took the steep grass under the lift, then veered off left near the summit into some cliffs and soon after impenetrable fields of <i>latschen</i>. The clouds parted and I saw that a short downclimb would get me to the normal trail. I did this, then hung out a few minutes at the summit, getting a nice view of the Wilder Kaiser. Everything else was in cloud. The snow has left the pre-alps...hard to believe in all this rain and cold! Hiked down the normal route.
