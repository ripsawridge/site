### Texel Peaks
_October 21, 2022_

Short visit to Südtyrol. I love that place. First 1500 meters, then, according
to Google, a massive 2200 meter day. There were a lot of ups and downs, but
still, I'm going to discount that to 1800!

### Grosse Riesenkopf
_October 18, 2022_

A late-afternoon hike up this local peak.
I took a wrong turn on the way down, then had to creep through barbed-wire
fences at dusk. I heard a sound and looked up with some shock to see a
cow inquiring right in my face! She followed me across two fields, sometimes
running to keep up with me!

### Bad Feilnbach long hike
_February 18, 2022_

I [made a tour on Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/675454148)
on a fantastic, windy day. I've been doing a lot of long, relatively
flat walks to toughen up my feet and legs for hiking the CDT.
It's been really important to increase the number of miles and
let go of my obsessive desire for elevation gain. The only way
to toughen up the feet is long mileage. Anyway, it was an incredibly
fun day. 18.3 miles in total, and about 1400 feet up and down.

A neat pond along the way.

An incredible "grotto" in which one can meditate on the glory of Mary.

A day of wind, of alert horses, of fast moving clouds, of rain
and sore feet, and a good "frischkäse" sandwich from the Edeka in Bad Feilnbach.

### Pletzachkogel and Roßkogel
_January 4, 2022_

Very interesting hike. Steeply up to a small (inhabited!) cabin
in a meadow with a Charlie-Brown-esque Christmas bush, then
on a steep road and trail to the Pletzachkogel summit. From
there over to a kind of abandoned ski area compound, and with
snowshoes steeply up to the high abandoned lift station.
I peered inside the windows of the adjoining hut to see a rack
of kettleballs and "WOD" (workout of the day) notations on a
chalkboard. It's some kind of revanchist "body kultur" hideout!

I'm only kidding -- seems really cool. Anyway, the final climb
to the summit of the Roßkogel was interesting. I scrambled up
a rocky ridgecrest with a rather difficult step. Meanwhile an
extremely agile man came bounding down the ridge and batmanned
through the latschen trees in an area of similar difficulty
20 meters to my left. In fact, I saw many people this day (8 or 10?).

Aside from the radio tower on the summit, it's a neat place.
There are likely no better viewpoints of Guffert.

1600 meters up and down.

Just above the steep road in the forest, we come out on the slopes
of Pletzachkogel.
