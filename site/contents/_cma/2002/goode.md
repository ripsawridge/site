* Mt. Goode, Northeast Buttress (5.5, IV)
* July 27-29, 2002

Saturday morning Chris Koziarz 
and I hiked in from Rainy Pass. We took 
a 8.5 mm 60 meter rope, one ice tool and 2 screws in case of glacier 
difficulties. We had a light rock rack. I wore Vasque Sundowner boots 
and brought aluminum crampons. A light canister stove would cook our 
meals. The usual bivy-sack equipment came along too. Chris wore heavier 
boots, but hiked in sandals all the way to Grizzly Creek.

The PCT was uninteresting for long periods. Finally, after about 
8 miles the river became a gorge,
with exciting crags on both sides. We crossed a creek on a swaying 
footbridge. After another mile of hiking, we took a"short cut" from 
the PCT to North Fork Bridge Creek, by leaving the trail at 3000 ft. 
elevation, and side-hilling to the right. This took about 
10-15 minutes, and saved a descent to the river, which looked pretty 
far down. After the Grizzly Creek junction (crossed on a log 3 miles 
from our short cut), we hiked another 3/4 mile to the climbers 
trail going down to the 
creek. A pretty scary log crossing (Chris said he couldn't 
breathe), then we followed 
Beckey's directions through timber and brush to talus slopes 
below slabs. The way was fairly obvious up 3rd class slabs and 
brush, with an occasional harder move. We were happy to see 
rappel stations above such locations!
The steep ground now behind us, we hiked up along a stream 
course to the usual bivy site at 5100 feet. Take advantage 
of it - there are no other flat spots in this basin.


The basin is very wild. From the river below, you view an entire 
eco-system, going from brush to talus, cliff to snow, ice to 
rock, rising 6000 feet in 1.6 miles. Dozens of waterfalls spill 
through the cliffs. Menacing chunks of ice hang above, and the 
black rock of Goode itself seems impossibly remote, usually in the clouds.


We fought with a marmot who tried to steal and chew anything not 
locked down, and battled with hordes of mosquitoes biting us around 
the face (only exposed skin). During the night, clear skies reassured us.


But dawn brought gray clouds, and scarier black clouds in the east. 
We weren't getting rained on, so it seemed worthwhile to continue. 
Climbing onto the glacier at the far left, we dealt with a short 
icy crevasse problem, then easily walked snow above the ice cliffs to 
the left side of the buttress toe. The moat looked very difficult 
at first, but hiking down 100 feet found a place where suspended 
ice blocks allowed us to tip-toe across. As we prepared for the 
rock climb, some of these blocks fell into the depths!


Right away, we encountered steep 5th class climbing. We had doubled 
the rope, so leads were short (100 feet), and this was a little 
annoying, as it took effort to build even a marginal belay on the 
alternately slabby or loose rock. We trended right for two pitches, 
making for a solitary scrub tree. But overhangs began to appear, and I 
climbed leftward for the last pitch, mostly traversing. This was 
the right choice, eventually reaching the buttress crest at a broad, 
low-angle shoulder. The next pitch was about 600 feet of 3rd and 4th 
class terrain. We were happy to move quickly after the initial 
difficulties. Chris really stretched our gear, probably for 
another 400 feet of increasingly interesting terrain. Now the 
buttress crest became sharp, and I led two exciting pitches on a 
knife edge. I resorted to an aid move above the pitch two belay. 
The only cracks for gear were between loose blocks that expanded 
when I tugged on the cam or nut, and a difficult slab move (in boots) 
lay ahead. A body weight piece served as a handhold, then foothold. 
Even with that, I reached the top of the slab breathing heavily. 
Chris scoffed at my 5.8+/A0 rating from the security of the top rope! 


Occasionally the clouds would blow away, and we'd see the glacier 
and river below. This was exciting! A patch of blue above would 
appear, and I'd imagine us on the summit with a"sea of clouds" view. 
But these were sucker holes - we would find ourselves sitting in the 
clouds admiring the carved out bivy sites right on the summit, 
chagrined at the weather.


After some more simulclimbing (we only belayed 6 pitches, 3 of them 
right above the glacier) on rock that was changing to beautiful golden 
granite, we reached bivy sites and the traverse to the Black 
Tooth Notch (taken on our descent). 300 feet more, and we were on the 
summit, 9.5 hours from our camp. We thought this was pretty good, 
until we read of Haley/Paull in the summit register - 7 hours from the 
Stehekin shuttle to the summit. They had (probably) made the 
first day trip of the climb on 7/15. We were subdued, wanting to think 
about the great climbing we had enjoyed, but worried about the long descent.


Climbing and rappelling down to the notch (an exposed but easy 
traverse gets there), we emerged on the south side of the mountain, 
and began rappelling down the loose SW Couloir. Three rappels got 
us to walkable terrain, then we followed a cairn around a ledge 
in order to avoid slabby cliffs. More walking led down to a snow 
bowl at ~7000 feet. The view of the mountain was just as impressive 
from this side - vertical golden towers, appearing and disappearing 
behind fast moving clouds. The wind was becoming fierce, and 
knocked us off balance as we traversed the mountain to the Goode/Storm 
King Col. We found trickling water in a heathery meadow below the 
col, a sweet surprise! We ached to climb Storm King, it was so 
close and easy-looking. But we had enough work ahead of us to 
get back to camp, that we were forced to restrain 
ourselves (a good choice, but not enough to save us).


From the incredibly windy col, we made an overhanging rappel to the Goode 
Glacier (felt rather committing). The downclimbing went well, and we 
crossed a bergschrund on a good snowbridge. More crevasses were easily 
crossed as sections of the glacier buckled and heaved, making us worry 
about getting down. We made a crucial decision to traverse far to the 
right above an ice cliff, rather than descend a steep snow slope we'd 
seen down in the valley. As we made our diagonal descent, we 
shivered at the good fortune our choice had provided: the steep snow 
slope turned to black ice, and ended in a jumble of seracs and crevasses.


It was already evening, and darkness came early due to persistent cloud 
cover, and a light rain. Getting off the glacier was slow. My crampons 
balled up with snow often, and my hiking boots weren't heavy enough to 
make a good plunge-step. 
We left the glacier, reaching a cliff that provided a dim view of the 
basin and our camp. Unroping, we climbed down slabs, sure that a hot 
meal and sleeping bag awaited us within the hour. It was 9 pm, 
15 hours after we started. But the slabs became steep, and slick with 
water and moss. Full darkness found us traversing waterfalls and climbing up 
and down in exasperation. I nearly slipped in a streambed, feeling the 
cold shock of water down my sleeve when I reflexively reached up for a 
rock under the spray. We knew this was very ill-advised, certainly the 
most dangerous part of the trip. After some debate, we climbed back up 
to the glacier, and found a snow slope leading further down, hopefully 
below the steep slabs. At first we were encouraged, getting several 
hundred feet lower, then finding ourselves in similar terrain. Like 
persistent insects, we tried again. This time we were lucky, as a 
pattern of shrubs allowed a belayed descent of a weeping slab. We had 
reached the basin!


Now for the tedious traverse to camp. But after an hour, camp was 
nowhere to be found. Many theories were explored. Half-visible humps in 
the darkness were, or could be, remembered shapes from the morning. 
I was out of steam, but Chris made an energetic traverse to the far 
end of the basin and back. I knew we were close, but despite various 
ascents and descends of brushy ribs we always came up empty. At 1 
am I sat in the heather, prepared to wait for morning. Anything to 
stop moving! Chris toiled for another hour, sailing from dim reef to 
atoll, his lamp visible in the fog. The basin seemed lonelier with the 
solitary lamp bobbing far away from my perch. He returned, and we 
tried to get comfortable in"camp." The rain was light enough that it 
didn't make us wet for a long time. 


The long vigil isn't worth recounting. Thoughts circled back to the 
climb (which I still considered"fun"), but were wrenched back to gnaw 
on the bones of"finding camp" and"escaping." Sometime after 4:30 am, 
we could see enough, that it hit us both at the same time - we were 
right above camp. We hadn't explored directly below because of 
worrisome slabs. As we prepared to leave, my bivy sack below grew 
neon bright, seemingly delighted at the irony.


We returned to a trashed camp. Chris didn't hang some items in the small 
tree, and they were scattered or taken by the intrepid marmot. One 
hiking pole was extensively chewed, another was gone. A shirt drying on 
a tree was filled with holes and matted with mud. Chris muttered about 
various poisoning schemes, I found it rather funny, and was 
thankful that the marmot spared our
expensive bivy sacks. Actually, my hiking pole was improved - 
he had"softened" the strap material nicely. Again the mosquitoes 
found us, and we conked out for 4 hours, feet deliciously dry and warm!


Finally moving down at noon, we entered the brush, downclimbing and 
rappelling, slowly reaching the valley floor. This time, we found a 
snowbridge to cross the creek. It was pretty thin. We crawled across 
and pulled the packs afterwards. It was 3:00, finally we were 
hikers again! Near Grizzly Creek we saw a black bear in the 
forest, about 100 feet off the trail."Bear," I said 
weakly."No biggie." He moved on a parallel course for a while, 
then allowed us to continue unmolested. 


The last eight miles of the hike out was marked by"trail madness," a 
surge of desperate energy directed to escaping. At 9:15, I rolled into 
a fetal position by the car. Chris produced a magic 
elixir: Safeway grape juice!
