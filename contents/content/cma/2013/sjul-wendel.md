### Night hike up Wendelstein
_July 4, 2013_

Riki and I hiked up the Wendelstein after work. It was a rainy day, but happily the mountain was pretty clear. A cloud came in as we approached the summit and we had light rain on the hike down. We only needed headlamps near the end. ~3 hours round trip, 1000 meters.
