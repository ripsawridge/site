I've noticed that this blog chronicles all falls on my bike since moving
to Munich. So I have to keep it up. I left work Monday in a good mood.
After I got my bike I realized I forgot my gloves inside. Not a good idea
in freezing Munich! So I rode around to the front of the building, just
to step inside and get them. WHAM! Suddenly I was on the ground, slamming
chest-first on the pavement, my bike skittering away into the street. Luckily
no cars were coming. A passerby got my bike and another helped me up. Very
embarrassing. I sat for a while rocking back and forth to work off the
pain in my knee. A crowd gathered around me, telling me to get up. I said
I was okay and just needed to sit a moment more. Everybody left but one
guy stayed to lecture me for a long time about being careful, how it's
dark, how you should get right up after you fall, etc. I didn't have the
bandwidth to listen to him, I was just too confused as to how it happened
so quickly.
  
  
So hopefully that is the (only) fall for this year!
  
  
Oh, the front plastic fender of the bike is a causality. Sigh. There goes
30 euros.
