### Belgian rock (Feyer, near Dinant, Belgium)
<b>May 18, 2010</b>

Rafal, Marek and I got in two pitches at the cliffs of Freyer. Beautiful
limestone, though sometimes hilariously polished. It was their first trip out,
so really rewarding for us all. Next time we'll do some multipitch climbs. Some
pictures are <a
