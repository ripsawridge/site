### Via Ferrata dell'Amicizia

_October 12, 2008_

During our fun family camping trip to Riva del Garda, I had a few hours one
evening after we put the boys to bed. Under a full moon, I hiked up above Riva
to the old castle tower above the town. I kept going, and eventually got onto
the Via Ferrata dell'Amicizia. In the blue light of the moon, I climbed long,
vertical ladders up sheer walls of stone, with the great Garda lake and towns
pulling at me from below. Pretty outrageous position! At the summit of Cima
SAT, I went down then left to re-join trail 404, eager to stop at the small
chapel on the face 'round midnight. No ghosts present. A rewarding and unusual
experience. 1200 meters up/down, 3.5 hours car to car.
