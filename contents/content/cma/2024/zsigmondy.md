## Zsigmondyspitze

My friend Uli had climbed this mountain solo years before and it came
into my sights recently, what with climbs of Tristner and the Ahornspitze.
I'd seen a video on YouTube where a couple approached the peak from the
Gunggltal, and that seemed very interesting. I waited for the snow to
melt and good weather, then left home at 4 in the morning one day.

At the Maxhütte, I stopped for coffee. Toby, the caretaker, had to run
an errand, so when I wanted to pay he was gone. I left 20 euros and a
note saying I'd be back for a beer after, then took off up the valley.
It was a longish walk, and I was glad I started early, such that I wasn't
in sun until after finishing the hike/scramble above the waterfall at the
valley head. I passed a woman with a large pack, probably backpacking
for several days.

I also chatted with a guy from Bad Feilnbach named Michael, and we talked
about hikes around there. I know that area well from training hikes for the
CDT in 2022. He was pretty fast, and going for the Zsigmondyspitze too.
I figured I might see him once more, though he would be heading down to the
Berlinerhütte on the standard approach so I might miss him.

After a final steep climb, I was at the Melkerscharte. I followed some
other people here across awkward boulder slopes to the base of the route.

*The rope-up point on the Southeast Ridge*

From here, I switched to rock shoes. I also had a helmet, harness and a
handful of slings in case I needed to anchor to something.

The climbing felt a little slippery -- I realized I'd become used to
limestone (*kalk*) over the preceeding months, and slabby granite had a
slightly insecure feel about it. Nonetheless, I enjoyed a pitch or two
straight up the ridge to a point where the easy line goes far, far out
left across the face, then back up on a grassy ramp.

*The ridge, and the rather strange long detour to the left across the face*

Indeed, the traverse out left has a spicy location with big exposure!
There are a couple of bolts to protect the traverse. It felt especially
strange because at the hardest points you are traversing downward on
slabby, downsloping terrain. I can see why a rope would be helpful here!

But I found the upper ramp, which featured a good ten minutes of walking
before requiring the use of hands again as the ramp blends back into the
face near the ridge. At this point, the wind was quite strong and a number
of climbers were standing around or moving a little bit up or down,
depending.

*A friendly Bad Feilnbacher named Michael*

I climbed through a party making abseils here, and found Michael on a
ledge. We sat a few minutes and talked. He encouraged me to follow the
ridge above the Melkerscharte instead of settling for the awkward boulderfield.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/IMG_1959.jpg %}
*Michael, descending*

We said our goodbyes and I climbed an interesting pitch leading to either a
grade IV- crack climb, which looked great, or a grade II easier way. I chose
that way. After a few minutes, I was on top.

*A favorite bit of crack climbing*

Very cool! I'd anchored myself to the cross and sat with legs dangling,
looking at abseiling climbers and enjoying the big views to the south.
I had to be quite careful on the descent -- no mistakes allowed!

*Interesting scrambling above the 'scharte*

Indeed, as Michael had suggested, the climbing/scrambling on the ridge
was pretty neat...sometimes offering hand-traverses with a bit of
uncertainty as to how they finish! I think it took a bit longer, but it was
great.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/IMG_1984.jpg %}
*A friendly early evening in the Gunggltal*

Wow, what a long descent. The Gunggltal is enormous...I had so far down
to go! Finally I reached the Maxhütte just in time for beers with the
friendliest group of mountain climbers I ever met. And Toby was impressed
with my trip...he'd been wondering what I was going to climb.

It only took a few minutes of sitting with these excellent people to decide
to stay the night. Why not?

*Toby prepared a special dinner for me*

We talked about peaks around here, and made a rough plan to climb the
Floitnerturm later. Max decided to stay the night as well, and hike up
the Gaulspitze with me the next day -- Toby had recommended it and after
the amazing dinner he made, and all the great beer and dessert he and Lisa
made (along with a fantastic shower), I couldn't in good conscience just
walk down the valley in the morning. The Gaulspitze, rising right above the
hut above a steep trail would be the work of the morning!

After a long talk of many things, whether of mountains or of the world,
we all said goodnight and Max and I repaired upstairs to the spacious
*lager*.

## Gaulspitze

In the morning, Max decided to head down, feeling pretty sore from climbing
the Gaulspitze the day before. But Flo and Felix were heading up. Toby
showed us the start of the climb and we set off. They were much faster than
me, so they pulled ahead, but I caught them for a while as we rested halfway
up. Man...what a steep trail! Lots of fun though. Unfortunately, clouds
filled the valley and we entered a gray murk a bit below the summit.

We talked about many things, from artificial intelligence to the difficulty
making a living as a farmer in an increasingly strict regulatory environment.
We also planned a future climb on the Zugspitze.

Lunchtime beer at the hut, then quickly down for me, and back home. I've
really got some great friends up there. I never had the experience where
every single person I met unleashed an ocean of discussions, future plans,
ideas of all kinds. The whole weekend felt like an incredible gift.

I'm lucky. I'm blessed. The mountains are good, and the people even better.

Oh, I made a small instagram "reel":
