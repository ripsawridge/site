The Tristner (or Dristner) mountain has always impressed me. I'd been up
twice before from Ginzling, and knew it was time to tackle the north ridge,
also called the Harpfnergrat (Harpfner Ridge). It would require some
exposed scrambling, in fact, climbing to UIAA grade 3- or so (5.0 YDS).

So I got up at 4:30 in the morning yesterday, loaded my cheap mountain
bike into the van and drove to Ginzling. Soon I was coasting back down the valley
to Mayrhofen on the bike. I stashed it in the woods at the start of the trail,
which begins between two concrete garage buildings of a private house (~650 meters).
It looks like no one lives there but a lady was airing out a blanket on the
upper balcony. I hurried up and away on the stone steps and was soon clearing
away the spider webs in the steep forest.

After about 300 meters of elevation gain in the pleasant forest, the trail levels out
on the right side of the ridge, making for a saddle with a cabin. The trail
continues faintly through a meadow on the ridge up to a cabin with a mechanical
lift coming from the valley. Above this, the forest trail is quite beautiful.
I kept hearing a booming sound from the valley on the right, thinking there was
a quarrying operation. Hours later, I realized it was the wind rolling down
the valley from the Stausee and glaciers higher.

Things opened up a bit, and two local guys came by. After a short chat they
left me in the dust. One of the men was about 10 years older than I. It was
inspiring to see that whatever fitness I have, it could be so much better.

I came to some cabins. One of them had a big water barrel. I refilled some
water here from it. I was kind of surprised at this great little community of
cabins which can only be reached by a rather punishing climb. The highest
of them was at 2000 meters, so a stiff 1400 meter climb from town is
required to get there. Respect!

Above that the trail was sometimes faint, though it didn't matter because
you just stayed on the ridge, or walked and scrambled up boulderfields.
The first climbing moves are at 2220 meters, where you climb a short
slab at the bottom left side of a wall. A mix of deep steps in turf, a few
small trees to grab, stemming between rock walls get you to the ridge
crest above the wall. From here, the incredible view of at least 5 towers
on the ridge to the summit is impressive. I gamely set to work. Sometimes
a gust of wind required me to sit on the ridge *Ã  cheval*. At other times
I moved forward rapidly because the ridge was an easy, grassy path
suspended in the sky.

Paths occasionally went around the side of a tower, but I mostly avoided
those because it was alarming to follow one and find yourself well
below the crest on a steep, grassy face. Better to make a few moves on
granitic shards, after testing them thoroughly.

Finally, I reached the great gray plug of the summit formation. There was
interesting climbing in here, little jewels of stemming and liebacking
scattered between boulderfields and scruffy terrain. I was on top at
1:15, 5:45 after starting. I'd read some other reports and it seems for most
people the ridge takes 4 hours. I am not most people I guess!

Clouds had gathered and thicked over the highest peaks over the last couple
of hours, and so I didn't linger too long at the summit. I signed the register,
enjoyed the dramatic views and ate the last of my chocolate. Soon I was
picking my way down the really, really exposed southern route. It actually
felt more tense than the climb up. I also took a wrong turn about 100 meters
down and ended up on a faint trail above impossible green slopes - how can
they be so steep? That was a nerve-wracking 5 minutes (should have just gone
back up).

You simply cannot relax on the upper 500 meters of this trail. A slip is
unthinkable. I kind of think that with a bit of effort to build the trail,
the northern route would actually be easier and safer!

I got some water at the cabin and rested a good while, actually laying down
and quasi-napping. This made the last 800 meters of forest descent more
enjoyable. I find that to be a really beautiful trail. It's rather overloaded
with sticks and pinecones at the moment though, I hope a fella with a broom
comes along!

Very happy for this climb, because on the drive to Mayrhofen, the ridge looms
in the distance as a challenge. It's an important and challenging feature
of this country, and whether you hike it or not, it waits for you and
wants you to know it better. Or so it seems to me. Thank you Tristner for
a great day. Thank you God for guiding my steps!
