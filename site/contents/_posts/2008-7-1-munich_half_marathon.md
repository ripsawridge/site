With some folks from work, I ran in the half-marathon Sunday. Dreading
the occasion a little bit, because I've slacked off on any running for
the last month or so. The combination of hot weather and visit from Kris's
parents gave me a lot of excuses! So I knew it would hurt a bit.
  
  
There were 17,000 runners. I was hoping to come in somewhere around 2
hours total time. It was definitely interesting running in a huge crowd.
We headed north from the start at Marienplatz into the English Garden.
The bulk of the run took place there, going up and down along different
trails. I drank water a few times at way-stations. I also gave myself 3
one minute walk breaks. Somewhere after the half-way mark, my legs were
running out of gas. Oh well, just have to crank through! I looked at my
watch and got excited to maybe beat 2 hours, and that kept my pace up until
the end. In the last minute I "sprinted" though my legs were so slow you
probably couldn't tell the difference!
  
  
It paid off though...I came in with a time of 1:59\. One minute under 2
hours!
  
  
Afterwards there was free, cold, alcohol-free beer. Only in Munich, eh?
  
  
Thanks to Assaf at work for organizing our participation!
