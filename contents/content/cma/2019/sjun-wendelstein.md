### Wendelstein wanderings

_June 19, 2019_

Georg, Jaro and Tamer and I hiked up the Wendelstein. Well, Tamer and I called
it good at the meadow below the main peak. We had great conversations! Then we
headed down, and all met up eventually. About 600 meters up, I think.

I slept in the woods so as to begin a solo weekend hike the next day.
