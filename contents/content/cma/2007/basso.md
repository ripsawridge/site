               - From Aidan's notes on the climb, September, 2007.

Last August, despite a long spell of bad weather, I had the pleasure of
climbing on the Campanile Basso with my friend Aidan. It was our first visit to
the Brenta Range. Starting the hike in late afternoon, we had to laugh at the
extended friendly hordes of Italians coming down the trail. It was a hot day
and my pack felt heavy. I lazed along, somewhere behind Aidan, but I finally
perked up when we saw the massive Crozzon di Brenta in front of us. Actually
that's what we wanted to climb, but a big pile of fresh snow covered the top,
and the hut warden thought we were crazy to even think about it. We chickened
out, but were well rewarded with the Basso.

At a belay in the Fehrmann Dihedral

In the morning we started early, passing by the somber memorial to fallen
climbers. Aidan was feeling bleak. "I don't know if climbing is really the
thing for me..." he said with a thousand-yard stare. His mood was catching, and
soon I was walking with heavy tread too, wondering what it all means. Sighing
deeply, we ascended cones of scree to reach the base of the climb: a collection
of corners leading up and right, entering the Fehrmann Diehedral proper after a
couple of entry pitches.

"On belay?" I queried.

"Whatever" said Aidan, missing his girlfriend and pining for a normal life. He
spent months in Africa, and after visiting me and his parents he'd go back to
study Arabic for 6 more months.

7 or 8 pitches up, loving it.

"Young fella, meaninglessness is a luxury. Be like me and focus on the next
hold. After that, the next climb. After that, whats fer dinner? Pretty soon
you'll fergit about the hollow void, stretching away into meaningless yet
tedious years!"

My attempts to rouse him from existentialism got nowhere. "Yeah. Sigh. I can
see how you'd see it that way..."

I felt bad for him. Whatever you have at age 20 is not enough. It represents
sameness, sterility, nothing exciting. Even if what you have is something a
bunch of old weekend warriors like me would give their eyetooth for: lots of
free time and good health. I remembered myself at that age, easily sleeping all
day and playing Zelda all night. I look back and think what a waste of time!
But I was figuring things out in some kind of dim way. One things for sure,
Aidan is doing a better job than I did.

The "Preuss Wall" is vertical for four amazing pitches

In a way, I think we couldn't be further apart in our goals and values than
right now. When we met, he was 15 years old, and psyched out of his mind just
to go climbing. Now, he's old enough to have seen the limitations of my world.
Over the course of my thirties, I've "settled" with life. I know enough about
what makes me happy, and I know what I can expect and what I can't. I spend
less time railing against a crazy world and more time observing it's
peculiarities without judgement. What a bland and frustrating outlook for
someone with the chance to change the world! And my knowledge that Aidan can do
great things is a given for me, like gravity.

The notion of a "fixed" or "crystalized" personality is abhorrent to the young.
I tried to explain that I was always ready to go climbing, and was incapable of
tiring of it. "Sometimes you scare me, Michael," was the commentary on that. I
wanted to laugh, but I realized how much that sounds like a machine, how
inhuman. I saw a vision of myself, Gollum-like, scratching across the rocks,
personality hardened into bone. Bone that hinders and limits even as it
supports.

But I love life, and am a relatively happy-go-lucky fellow. If these are the
signs of aging in me, I imagine it is a natural thing. And holding a fixed
attitude about this or that is undoubtedly productive, just as a taut sail will
bring speed and surety. Is this then, ultimately, why our grandfathers keep old
newspapers, or only change the oil on the other side of town?

"No one gets out of here alive." The act of living, or thinking about living,
year after year causes changes. Mowing along in my head at night, thinking
that's cool and this is fucked and he's stupid and I loved that book. I finally
look up and see what I've wrought: character. Not a great one, but it's mine
and I know it well. I conclude it's inevitable, this "death-through-hardening."
The impetus to decide, to divide comes from youth, never comfortable with
shades of gray.

As I considered these thoughts I reflected on something else that bothered me.
I had been wondering what was wrong with me because I still went technical
climbing after my boys were born. Some friends said they had to climb down,
shaking, the magnitude of evil possibility too much to bear. Was I just being
selfish? Or was I missing an essential piece of human feeling? But after
thinking about this topic I reached an understanding that made sense to me: I
had already "fixed" that part of my life. When I first learned about Fred
Beckey, I was so impressed that I began the process of imprinting attitudes and
repeated actions designed to sustain an excitement for mountains for the rest
of life. 

I look down at myself from a height, seeing a small bundle of energy, fussing
over quixotic pursuits. I admit the silliness of it all. Yet I cling to these
useless pursuits anyway. Am I completely insane or just completely human?


Recounting every pitch of the climb no longer seems necessary. There were
moments of near magic on the Preuss headwall, a vertical dance of apprehension
and wonder. I will let those moments acquire the fuzzy glow they deserve. I sat
down to write about the great experience, but ended up reflecting on the great
friendship. And in reflecting, learning.
