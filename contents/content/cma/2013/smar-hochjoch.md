### Hochjoch and clowning
_March, 2013_

Georg and I had big ambitions for an ice climb: the Renkfall! But we were
idiots! We decided we could hike in in boots instead of skis. The 2 hour hike to
the basin went pretty well, but then an ADDITIONAL 2 hours of plowing through
deep snow to the climb, we arrived, me with frozen toes, Georg with frozen
feet. Sigh. Oh well, at least we know the approach.

The next day we skied up a local (Oberinntal) mountain called Hochjoch. The
wind was so terrible we had to do the last 500 meters of elevation gain on
foot, leaning deep into the screaming weather. By golly we weren't going to
turn around!!
