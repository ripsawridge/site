### Pu'u Manamana
_December, 2007_

I went on this intriguing hike on Oahu. It gains a knife-edged ridge, even
features some rock climbing on the very exposed crest. Then it becomes an
endurance fest up and down along a completely grown-over jungly ridge before
taking a side ridge down. I ruined my shoes in the jungle muck! Still, it was a
good challenging hike. Pictures later, some of them are great.

### Wank
_December 6, 2007_

Two friends from work and I hiked up in the morning. Well, I was keen on skiing
again so I brought skis. They had snowshoes. We decided to take a southern
trail though, and it was clear there would be no skiing all the way up, so I
hid them and kept on. Near the summit there was enough snow for snowshoes, and
there were great views of town and the Wetterstein Range. Good hike! Came
quickly down and to work.

### Scheinbergspitz
_December 2, 2007_

Wow, I'm really short on short reports this year! Oh well. I got out Sunday
morning for a few hours to ski up and down the Scheinbergspitz in the Ammergau
Alps. It's about 3 kilometers west of the famous castle Linderhof (I still
haven't been in there, though Daniel recommends it highly). The weather was
much better than expected, mostly blue sky, a few small snow flurries. The 1000
meter ascent was straightforward. I left my skis at the base of the summit
pyramid and hobbled up an icy slope to gain the ridge, then made use of a fixed
line to help climb the final 50 feet. The views were gorgeous. It looked like
rain over the lowlands, but the snowy peaks were shining. I especially liked
the view off towards Reutte and the Plansee (hidden from here). The Allgäu and
Lechquellengebirge are very beautiful and rugged.

Going down was hard. I was just very tense and afraid of falling in the kind of
crusty, poor snow conditions that prevailed. Especially once back in the forest
where narrow tobaggan runs gave no chance to slow down. I provided a lot of
comedy for the (now) crowded trail. Finally I remembered some things from my
ski class the year before, and made a few good turns in untracked snow of the
forest. 4.5 hours up and down.

### Wank
_September 24, 2007_

Riki and I got out for a fun morning hike of this pretty mountain with the great views of the Wetterstein Range. Very pleasant ascent and then some fun running on the way down...whee! Back in the city 'round 10:15 am.

### Hoher Fricken (attempt)
_September 13, 2007_

Uli and I had a comedy of errors this morning. We hiked to Hoher Fricken, but
my faulty memory led us up the wrong dirt road to start the thing. Then the
trail petered out and we followed our nose up through steep, but fairly open
forest for an hour before finally regaining the trail. Here we moved quickly
until reaching the great basin below Bisher and Hoher Fricken. Again, I screwed
up. I saw a faint path leading up to the ridge crest that matched what I took
last time. But last time there was significant spring snow covering the
horrible latschen trees. This time, the path didn't work at all. Finally, while
we struggled in head-high latschen jungle, I looked at my watch. It was late.
We needed to turn back immediately :-(.

Which we did, and to our credit we bombed down very quickly. I don't know the
exact elevation but it's something like 4000 feet and then a long 1/2 mile or
more of flat walking. It took an hour. Thanks to Uli for hurrying back with me!
Just unbelievable how lost I can get...

### Fraunwasser climbing
_July 17, 2007_

Uli and I went for some morning climbing. I was still tired from the
Grossglockner climb Sunday, so I had no confidence at all on the deceptively
steep slabs. Of course I made it worse by picking a hard line of 3 grade 6
pitches to start with ;-). At virtually every crux I had to stop and rest on
the rope. On the second pitch I was scared to go for the third bolt which
committed me to climbing over a roof. I said I would lower off, then somehow
got the guts to go for it. But I really like the roof because it has big holds
above...last time with Daniel I avoided it off to the left. 

So it was a somewhat frustrating morning, but probably good for me to work
through the uncertain feelings. Uli set a record for the hardest climbs he's
done outdoors.

### Obere Wettersteinspitze hike
_June 17, 2007_

I had the morning free, so I took a quick look at the computer to find a new
trail. My father-in-law was sleeping in the map and book room, and I didn't
want to wake him, so I just skimmed a map online to find a trail leading from
Mittenwald to the Obere Wettersteinspitze in 1200 meters of elevation gain.
That sounded like a good hike, plus it would take me to an area I've rarely
visited. I just had to remember to park on the west side of town, and follow
signs to the Lautersee. From there, I hoped being able to see the mountain
would make it clear.

Indeed, all went smoothly on the several trail junctions. Once the initial
forest approach is finished, the trail can be thought of as three cliffy
sections. The first cliff was sometimes protected by a steel cable to use as a
handhold. After that, there were still plenty of sections where I had to use my
hands (especially the final cliff), but there were no more protected sections
until the last 20 feet to the summit.

It was a really enjoyable hike, with a few surprises and ever-increasing views.
You need to be very comfortable with heights, because you are often walking
along a crumbly ledge with a drop-off of several hundred feet. High on the
route I even deviated for some mid 5th class climbing in a diehedral for 20
feet (okay, bouldering not climbing :-)). Very fun, but the Wetterstein Range
has a reputation for hard but brittle rock. I can attest this is true - you
might even call the rock treacherous.

The summit views were amazing, though I only stayed 10 minutes. It took me 2
hours and 20 minutes up, and 1 hour, 45 minutes down. I carried nothing but
some water and a camera. Hiking poles would have been nice.

Here are the pictures.

Here is what the "trail" looks like on the final ascent (I call it Cliff #3) of
the Obere Wettersteinspitze. On the left you can see some red spray paint dots
marking the way (and killing the adventure :-)).

On the trail to the Obere Wettersteinspitze, there are three major "cliffs" or
steep sections along the way. Here we are looking up at the second cliff. The
third lies out of sight beyond.

### Walk to Kastelruth
_June 13, 2007_

Kris and I rode a lift up from Kastelruth to the Marinzen Hütte, about 1500
feet above the town. After admiring the goats and playground up there (this
would be a great place for the kids), we wandered down roads and trails back to
the town. We really enjoyed the middle section of the hike, with expansive
meadows and views of towns below. But near the bottom, a thunderstorm broke
loose and we got soaking wet! Fun anyway, as we hardly ever get to hike
together.

### Bike to Seiser Alm
_June 12, 2007_

This afternoon at 1:20 pm I rode one of the hotel's bikes up to the Seiser Alm.
Wow, I never thought I could ride up such a steep road for so long. Maybe it
just has a super-low gear, which I certainly used!

I had to walk the bike for some steep stretches of road up to the little town
of Pufels (Bulla in Italian). But from there I cranked up in the lowest gear,
getting better and better views of meadows, trees and raging river. Every bend
of the road where I didn't have to get off and walk was a notch in my belt,
because I'm a notoriously lazy biker going uphill. 

After about 1 hour, I was in the Seiser Alm, though it took another 10 minutes
to reach the road to Compatsch where it meets the road to Monte Piz, which I
came up. Earlier in the day the whole family and I took the lift up to Mezdi,
and took a horse and carriage ride to somewhere in the middle of the Alm. The
driver told us that 160 people live up there year round, including him, and he
lives in Compatsch. Farmers come to live here in the summer, and there are a
bundle of holiday cabins you can rent. We should do that next year!

I rode quickly to Compatsch, awash in construction, and took the road up to a
restaurant called Panorama. This was more low-gear uphill cranking, but I felt
more confident after the crucible trip up from the valley. At the restaurant I
went in and ordered a Spetzi to go in my nice metal flask. People were playing
soccer and volleyball, and a metal band was getting ready to play inside. It
seemed like a real fun gathering of Italian high-school kids and a few parents.

I've ignored the scenery so far, but it was amazing! This really massive steep
mountain called Schlern loomed to the west. I have to climb one of those faces!
Plus it was swaddled in clouds, with some towers seemingly isolated from the
rest of the mountain. The sky above it was black, and the black clouds
enveloped the more gentle high ridge sweeping back southeast.

The Langkofel and friends were alternately buried in cloud and sometimes
pierced by rays of sun that turned the cliffs gold. If possible, the sky was
even blacker in that direction, and sheets of rain were pouring over
Wolkenstein further up the Groedner Valley. The climb of the Langkofel in 2002
with Mat is such a great memory. It opened so many doors to simul-climbing and
other creative techniques. I'm really proud of that climb, and the mountain is
even more beautiful to look at than ever. 

From Panorama I sped down the road, then cranked back up on a long trip to the
Mahlknecht Hut. There was a lot more climbing than I expected. Some people were
impressed with my journey, saying "Gute Fahrt!"

From the hut, it was a long and speedy descent to Saltria, then another speedy
leg down the Saltria valley (Jendertal in German). Whee! I saw some beautiful
scenes of yellow flowers with sun rays, more black skies over the mountains,
and lovely meadows.

What a fun trip it had been! And it was (gasp!) all on a bike!

### Kleine and Grosse Fermeda attempts
_June 11, 2007_

I road the lift up to Seceda from St. Ulrich at the ridiculously late hour of 8
am. The weather was beautiful for the moment. First I tried to climb a grade IV
route on the Kleine Fermeda, but the wet grass and mud on the first 3 pitches
scared me away. It was truly scary, as everything was slippery from rain the
night before. I had to leave two slings on horns to rappel down.

Discouraged, I thought I'd hike up the Sas Rigais instead. But then I realized
the back side of my Kleine Fermeda topo had a tiny line drawing of the normal
route on the Grosse Fermeda. At grade III it should be easy. So I found the
approximate starting point, and worked my way up gullies and short faces for
about 1000 feet. The weather was getting worse, and I especially debated
continuing when I had to traverse a long and very exposed grade II-III slabby
face. At one point I went up too soon, and found myself on probably grade IV+
terrain in tennis shoes. At that moment it started to rain. Beautiful!

Moving quickly left I got back on route, where I was right below a black face
that needed to be climbed straight up to then continue on to the summit. I
guess I was about 3/4 of the way up. But with the rain, it would be a race
against the rock getting slippery to get down. I descended, then made a
descending traverse to get back to the relative safety of the chimneys and
gullies that made up the lower half of the route. 

On the climb I came across two nice ring bolts, and three slings around
Sanduhrs here and there. I never used them because the rock still wasn't
completely soaked and I could go faster downclimbing. Finally, in very heavy
rain I used the last ring bolt for a rappel in the first grade III chimney.
More downclimbing, then a long walk back up to the Seceda lift to get back to
town.

I kept hoping to go back and finish the route in the following days, but it
never worked out. It was a fun, easy, but exciting climb all the same. It tests
your routefinding skills gently.

Unpleasant traverse. The clouds roll in as I traverse left and up on the normal
route of the Grosse Fermeda (YDS 5.5 here). Oh great, now it's raining :-).

### Östlicher Schoßkopf, "Goedeker"
_June 7, 2007_

On the face of it, this route looked within our capabilities: 15 pitches, grade
V, mostly easier. The book said that most belays were bolted. After a longish
hike up to the base of the wall, I started up a grade II-III ramp, and finally
built a belay at 60 meters around a block. Daniel came up, appalled at the
looseness of the rock. Then Daniel led a 40 meter pitch right, then up and back
left. This was a serious test for him, as it was pretty easy, but also loose
and without protection. He went up well though. We had a humorous shouting
match while he tried to explain that I should climb even though he couldn't
pull the rope up through the terrible drag. Eventually I figured it out and
coiled the rope around me and soon stood beside him. Daniel complained mightily
about the loose rock! He built a belay around a latschen bush, and really
thought the whole enterprise was beyond the pale. Indeed, we had wandered
slightly off route on that pitch, but soon I reached the "great terrace" and
recognized the route ahead. 

Here I wasted some time trying to find a belay. First I climbed up a gully a
ways, changed my mind, and went up the gully on the left (grade IV+ climbing to
get in). I thought I recognized a pod in this gully from a photo taken on the
route. But climbing up into it there was just a really thin sanduhr to belay
from, not good. I then looked above the pod and unwittingly knocked off a pile
of perched blocks. "Rock!" Daniel later said it came pretty close to him at the
belay. I downclimbed, and up into the gully on the right (again), where I built
a nut and cam belay in a solid crack. Now the real climbing will begin, I
thought.

But Daniel came up, and not encouraged by the lack of bolts, he went around to
the left to look just in case somehow I was off route. It was a good idea, but
as I stood there and looked at the photo, I was more sure I was in the right
place. But when Daniel called that he found lots of bolts and little arrows
drawn on the rock, I pretty much had to dismantle my belay and go over. We were
taking too long anyway, I suspected it was time to go home.

Indeed, there were lots of bolts but it wasn't our route, and we knew nothing
about things over here. We went to the far side of a level terrace, festooned
with bolts for some reason. We decided to try rappelling down from here. I had
a bad feeling about it, so I took Daniel's prussiks with me as I dropped over
the edge. I came into an enormous amphitheater on a free hanging rappel for the
entire length of the rope. The ropes were touching rock right at the bottom,
but I couldn't judge the angle of the rock. With no bolts or stations around, I
realized I would need to reclimb the rope. What a strange place...

So I prussiked back up the 15 meters or so I had gone down. Boy, it took a
while. At the top I insisted that we downclimb our route, or follow ledges
further north if it was easier. We put one rope away, and simul-climbed placing
occasional protection. This worked quickly and easily, and we did find an
easier way down on ramps and gullies. Yay! Didn't have to leave any gear!

Alas, a climb that ended before we made any actual "climbing moves", but still
a good learning experience for Daniel. I got some prussiking practice too. We
went home, enjoying a nice cold drink from a stream.

Looking back I think we could have succeeded on the climb. But without bolted
belays to provide a feeling of security, the will just wasn't there. The rock
wasn't encouraging either. Oh well.

### Fleischbank, Duelfer Route</a>
_May, 2007_

Daniel and I tried the Fleischbank Ostwand, but had two problems. After the
grade III traverse into the face (snowy, loose, wet), we had a nice grade V
pitch, then a daunting move to start the next pitch which we had to aid. (I
think a hold fell off). Daniel started worrying about the rest of the route and
felt a little sick. He went up for the next pitch, but some crack climbing
moves proved too hard. He came down and I went up. I was at the belay of the
6th pitch, where the first VI- traverse crux begins. Daniel came up a bit, but
was feeling mentally done-in by this climb, so I lowered him to the previous
belay and we prepared to leave. That was one problem, but the second problem
may have shut me down too. There was a waterfall running down the face to my
left. I _think_, but I'm not sure, that it may have run across the grade VI
traverse too. If so, the amount of water would have made it impossible.

So I rappelled, then we did a long double-rope rappel, then reclimbed back
across the entry ramp. We hiked along a protected path to a hut on the south
side of the range for a drink, then went home.

We still got some good pictures:

Our attempt on the Hans Dülfer route on the East Face of Fleischbank didn't
work out, but we still had some nice pitches on a nice day. Now to get down...


{% image /cmaimages/2007/302253.jpg %}
And this after the snow had mostly melted! In May 2007, there was a winter-like
period in the mountains with lots of fresh snow. We wished we had something
other than tennis shoes!

### Herzogstand
_May, 2007_

A morning hike up Herzogstand, then jogging along the ridge to Heimgarten, a slightly higher peak. Excellent views of the Karwendel Range, though a bit hazy. A little over 3 hours from car to car, carrying nothing. This was pretty tiring! The hiking guidebook says it should take 6.5 hours :-p.

### Rittner Horn
_Late April, 2007_

A morning hike up the Rittner Horn which is a long sloping mountain 2000 meters
above Bolzano, Italy. I got to cheat by driving up from our vacation hotel in
Oberbozen (Soprabolzano) so I only had to hike 800 meters. Really nice hike up
and down. Sadly, the air was too hazy to get the incredible overview scene of
the Eastern Alps I was hoping for :-(.

### Frauenwasser climbing area
_April, 2007_

Daniel and I did some climbs on a nice warm morning here. We climbed the 3-4 pitch "massif" twice, first via some harder (VI) pitches, then via some easier pitches. Really fun!

### Morning hike up Ettaler Manndl
_April 7, 2007_

I hiked up the Ettaler Manndl, and the Laberjoch (just a ski lift and restaurant there, not very exciting). For the Manndl, I took an easy rock climbing way, about 1.5 pitches called the Weiblkante. Good fun!

{% image /cmaimages/2007/283243.jpg %}

The route marked in green on the left is the Weiblkante (IV). The red route on
the right is a marked variant, rated UIAA VII. The blue dots mark bolts.

### Morning hike up Buchstein
_March, 2007_

Josef and I took advantage of some sunny weather to go hiking in the morning
instead of the boring ol' climbing gym. We hiked up Buchstein in 1.5 hours. I
consider that pretty good, even though it's fifteen minutes more than my time
last summer. You see, Kris and I ate at a restaurant called *Geniessen im
Dunkeln* the night before (in English it means "Enjoyment in the Dark"), and
even though it was pitch black all around me while eating, I managed to drink
many glasses of wine! So despite shaking from the DTs, it was worth getting up
early for the amazing scenery. It doesn't look like winter at all up there!

Josef took a nice picture.

### Skiing in Kühtai and Sölden
_January 6-7, 2007_

Daniel and I tried a ski tour above Haggen in the Sellrain, but a lack of snow,
or "WHUMP!"-ing scary snow when there was some made us lose interest. We turned
around after a couple of hours slogging up the valley.

We were soothed by groomed slopes of <a
href="https://www.bergfex.com/kuehtai/">Kühtai</a> up the road. Ah, how nice!
We went all over until we could hardly stand. We spent the night at an
inexpensive guest house near there.

The next day we went to <a href="https://www.bergfex.com/soelden/">Sölden</a>,
and oogled the incredible peaks around us. The Wildspitze looked especially
regal. We strung together all 4 big sections that make up this large ski area
during the day, giving a "thumbs down" to one of them because of too many
pebbles in the snow. But the two regions on glaciers were amazing. It was
really wierd to ski and see big ice walls on the side of you! Again and again
we lifted up 1000 meters then skied down, then up, etc. Really fun, great
skiing trip and many thanks to Daniel.
