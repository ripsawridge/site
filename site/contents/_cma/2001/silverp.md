Marek and I made plans to climb the South Face of the Tooth, what with all the
great weather since before Christmas. But Friday morning we arrived at Alpental
in spitting rain and snow. Looking at the surroundings, we saw there had been 12
inches of fresh snow during the night. Realizing that the climb would involve
much more scraping snow off of holds than we wished for, we fantasized about
other climbs, such as the North Face of Chair Peak. Three parties were already
ahead of us heading for that. We decided to follow, leaving snowshoes at the car
since they did too. Only 20 minutes later, the track disappeared, and we learned
all parties had bailed. We didn't like the conditions either, and without
snowshoes we couldn't have continued if we wanted to. So we bailed. We gave
discouraging words to two parties coming in for the climb, but wisely, they
ignored our advise and continued on. We don't know if they made it or not, but
I'm definitely curious. The snow stopped around 9 am, the day became very nice,
and there was no precipitation Friday night. Loren (Loren has a great
long-standing website http://www.cascadeclimber.com) and partner made the climb
Saturday.



So we decided to do something less technical. I was sighing a lot and
having motivation problems. I'm tired of getting all excited about a
technical winter climb, then (inevitably) abandoning the plan due to
changed conditions and signing up for a day of snowshoe plodding. I
actually didn't sleep at all Thursday night, being a bit wound up
considering mixed climbing on the Tooth. This didn't help my
motivation. But there was no way I'd let Marek down, who was chipper
as a spring chicken. He suggested climbing Silver and Abiel Peaks,
which sounded fine to me. We moved trailheads and were hiking around
7:30 am.



Trace amounts of snow on the trail made snowshoes unnecessary. In
fact, we wouldn't use snowshoes until near the end of our
trip. Plodding along dully and feeling tired, I slowly woke to the
beauty of the silent forest. We talked and continued upward to an
obvious gully. After the second gully (potentially dangerous in bad
snow conditions), Marek suggested heading straight up the slope to
meet the Northwest Ridge of Silver Peak.  He had climbed peaks and
traveled extensively in this area, but had never gone this
way. Immediately excited, I followed his steps for several hundred
feet, as the forest got steeper. We put on crampons after crossing an
icy gully, and continued up a ridge that became more and more
defined. It also became an exciting climb. With my clinometer, I
measured the slopes, and they were typically 55 degrees. The obvious
avalanche gully down at the trail was the classic 40 degrees. We were
chopping handholds for the hand without an ice ax, and the ridge
narrowed. The clouds lifted to reveal slopes on the other side of
Humpback Creek.



I relieved Marek and continued on snowy bulges, helped by occasional
scrub trees. The angle lessened a bit, and soon we were admiring the
scenery from the Northwest Ridge.  The light was beautiful, and we got
some pictures with Marek's camera. Marek led up the ridge, traversing
especially steep outcrops on the left or right. The snow conditions
were great, but we avoided open slopes as a general precaution. We
looked down on the vast snowfield leading down to Annette Lake. The
summit was windy, so we didn't linger very long.



But one interesting thing happened. There was a "fata morgana" around
my shadow, as projected on a layer of clouds below the summit. This
odd circular band of colors is apparently not seen very often. Also,
there was a circular rainbow in a larger circle about the same
point. Really strange and neat!



Now we went down gentle slopes to the saddle with Abiel Peak. Here, we
put on snowshoes for the first time. I was feeling really tired, it
just wasn't my day! But I was impressed enough by the view of Abiel
and the fairly steep slopes to the summit that I was ready to
continue. I changed back to crampons and followed Marek. There was a
short but really nice 55 degree section of hard snow (I'm really
getting into my clinometer!) that I had to detour over to
climb. Higher up, Marek gave me the lead since with crampons I could
kick more secure steps. The summit was a little anti-climactic,
probably due to waning energy. But the sky was changing to evening
colors and looked marvelous.



We went down quickly, retrieving our gear and continuing down to
Annette Lake on a low angle snowfield that traversed under the steep
north face of the mountain.  There were many icy gullies here,
something to think about for a climb one day.  A forested ridge on the
west side of the lake brought us to tracks we could follow out to the
trailhead. Sadly, we chose the wrong set of tracks, and they led us a
meandering journey up and down, finally up for 200 feet to meet the
main trail.  Switching to headlamps, Marek told me about the benefits
of being a flight attendant, and it sounded like one of the best jobs
in the world! I asked where I can sign up, but the real benefits come
with seniority.



There was a final adventure because I insisted on shortcutting two
switchbacks. It was much easier to walk straight down the snow rather
than deal with long traverses. The second shortcut must have saved us
a mile and a half, but we grew worried as we dropped deeper and deeper
into the valley, coming close to perilous log-choked streams. But we
finally came out on the trail, all was well.



Special thanks to Marek for introducing me to this surprisingly alpine
area! Before, when I thought of Silver/Abiel Peaks, I thought of clear
cuts, logging roads and ski infrastructure. But we found steep hard
snow climbing, cornices, blowing snow, and absolute solitude.
