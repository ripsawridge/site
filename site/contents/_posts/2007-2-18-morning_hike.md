Steve Knipple and I had discussed a morning hike a week ago. Amazingly,
despite the 5 little boys between our two families, it happened! I posted
pictures [here](http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2007/kramerspitze.htm).
  
  
Also, it was really cute at the end of the day. Elijah threw kind of a
tantrum so I sent him to his room. Then Rowan and I were eating dinner,
and Elijah didn't want to come out when I opened the door (he just closed
it again). After Rowan ate a few bites I sent him to let Elijah out. Well
Elijah came to the door and they kind of looked at each other for a minute.
Then Rowan gave Elijah a hug! They kind of smiled, and then Elijah came
out, ready to rejoin the world. What a sweet boy that Rowan is, I can't
believe he did that. I was very proud.
