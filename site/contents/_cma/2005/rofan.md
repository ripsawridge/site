It took quite a
while the night before to try and match up a hike that might be doable in bad
weather, had maximum views, had the possibility of a loop trip, along with easy
train access. In the winter (like, now), many buses to the mountains quit
running. Or rather, they say "see you for ski season!" and I'm in the wierd off
period. Finally I decided to go to this place called The Brandenberg Alps, or
the Rofan Range. It's a compact, cute little "range", with the high, snowy
Zillertel Alps to the south, and the imposing, rocky Karwendel Range to the
west.


The train was fast, taking 1.5 hours to Jenbach. There, I thought to maybe walk
to Maurach, but I got lazy and took a taxi. Had I known it would cost 14 Euros I
might have walked! It's only like 4 kilometers, and there was no traffic. That
cab driver apparently had to make his whole morning on my fare. The cab dropped
me off at the Rofanseilbahn, a lift that takes you some 800 meters up to the
Erfuhrter Hut. "Es kostet 14 Euro" said the dour woman. "I'll be right back" I
said, and quickly snuck away to walk up. Seriously, cash goes through my hands
like water here, time to get a little more miserly.


Apparently there was lots of snow up at the hut, and I thought that if it was
too snowy for me to hike, at least I'd make the 2500 foot hike up there. No
sooner did I think this than did the steep trail start kicking my butt. But I
stuck with it, and soon the foggy murk opened up a bit to see mountains around
me. The rocks in the trail were so slippery, that it was like walking on ice. I
wished for hiking poles for the first of many times that day.


After an hour or so, I was standing at the hut: "Erfuhrter Hutte geschlossen!"
said the sign. What? No busty waitresses and red-faced beer drinkers? There was
another restaurant but it looked expensive so I stayed away. I thought I could
fill my water bottle in the bathroom, but it had a "no drinking" sign over the
sink. I later wished I did it anyway, because it's silly to run a whole day on 3
cups of water!


So I wandered along a trail towards the Rofanspitze, following behind two rock
climbers. I wondered what they were going to do in the snow? Later I found out
that this little range is peppered with many rock climbs. On the hike, I mostly
wandered among snowy hills, just seeing one big rock face called the
Rosskopf. But once on the summit of the Rofanspitze, I could see the north
walls, which fell steeply down to heather slopes. It reminded me of the first
time seeing the north walls of the southern Pickets after the "relatively
gentle" (ha!) south side. These weren't as big, but they were even steeper. I
didn't feel my usual lust for the scariest looking face, but I enjoyed the
dramatic view.


The map showed a dotted line connecting high ridge points, and so I followed on
the crest of the ridge, which had some real "wow" moments. But I was disturbed
by the slippery rocks and thin layer of snow. When the trail went down steeply,
I had to be really careful. Hiking poles would have helped. So I left the high
ridge and followed trail around the south side of the Rosskopf. Climbing back
up, I started encountering really steep exposed sections of trail that had
little handlines. I was grateful under the current slippery conditions!


"Where are all the peeps?" I thought. So far, it was like a hike in Washington, nobody around at all.


I kept threading through and occasionally on the summits, finally deciding to
continue my traverse to a place called Dalfazalm and then go down to the town. I
was getting pretty tired and thirsty for sure. Finally I saw another crazy
person out in this weather. We said hello. Or rather, I said "Gross Gott!" and
he said something, kind of a half-question ("semmeln?"). I wasn't ready for that
so I just kept the smile frozen on my face and glid by. "Damn" I thought. Social
encounters can be awkward with a language barrier, sigh.


Back on my solitary way I entered my favorite part of the hike: a brown meadow
with impressive views out to the Karwendel. It was snowing lightly, and those
peaks looked fierce. While around me was a picturesque valley, which I'd love to
farm in if I lived in the year 1483.


Below this I made my way without incident back to the Seilbahn station. Getting
home was tough, because although I found a bus, I still ended up waiting almost
2 hours for the next train. "I would have been home by now, if I had a car!" I
thought with some frustration. But eventually the train came, and then the
now-familiar U5 from Hauptbahnhof to good ol' Friedenheimerstrasse and home.
