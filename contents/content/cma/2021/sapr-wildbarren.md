Barbara and I hiked up the steep way. We played a game as we approached the
summit: how many people would we find there? She guessed 4.
I guessed 12.

We arrived and counted 11. Right at that moment a single woman hiker
arrived, making it 12. And no one else came for many minutes. I won!

Barbara chose the way down: the steep way, then visit a trail that
traverses under cliffs to a road. We did this! Well, we took a wrong turn
and climbed about 100 meters accidentally. But then got back on track.
Great day, about 1200 meters up/down.
