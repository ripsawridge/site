Recently on a [Summitpost forum](http://www.summitpost.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=41099) we
were talking about the Alps and the Cascades. I spent a few minutes outlining
my thoughts...

Good question Jordan, and one I could wax on about forever. The Cascades
will always be my "home range," the one I compare everything to. That said,
I'll spend a few minutes focused on the alps...

**What is so great about the Alps:** I am in the Eastern Alps, which
are almost all limestone. The amount of alpine rock climbing here is incredible.
You would never, ever run out. From the mountains outside of Munich straight
south through the Dolomites the riches are immense. You almost can't compare
the Cascades, because there are so many more such climbs. Also wintertime
access is much better. And huts open all winter deep in the mountains mean
you can get to areas that would be completely "sealed off" in the Cascades.
The amount of backcountry skiing terrain is enormous.
  
  
**What surprised me about the alps:** much less crowded than I thought.
Especially if you climb adventure/"old school" routes. You'll see between
0 and 2 parties, just like in the Cascades. Also, I walked the famous "Chamonix
to Zermatt" Haute Route, and saw only 3-6 people per day in amazing country.
That was a big surprise.
  
  
**What is disappointing about the Alps:** of course they are bigger,
badder, and have so much wonderful infrastructure. But I found a few sad
things. One, the weather in the summer is unstable. August can be extremely
rainy, I think it's the worst summer month during the three years I've
been here. Two, it can be hard to find folks who understand the desire
for adventure/"no bolt" climbing. I think I've frightened many europeans
with my idea of a great weekend of climbing! (4 am start, use the whole
day until dark, so what if there are no bolts, yes we are only two on a
glacier, etc.) Smile
  
  
**Still learning:** It takes a long time to discover the weather patterns,
the unexpectedly nice areas you overlooked before, the like-minded friends.
My first few years in the Cascades were very unproductive because I didn't
understand the weather. I've been going through that here and am getting
better. I also learned how to backcountry ski here and that's added a great
new dimension to my year (made winter more fun).
  
  
I've been here 3 years now and my feelings about living here are very
positive, but complicated too. It's hard to know when/if we will go back
or not. One thing for sure, if we do go back it'll be to the Old Home...the
Cascades!
  
  
Thanks for the opportunity to jawbone...
