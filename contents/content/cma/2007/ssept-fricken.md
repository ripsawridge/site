### Hoher Fricken (attempt)
_September 13, 2007_

Uli and I had a comedy of errors this morning. We hiked to Hoher Fricken, but
my faulty memory led us up the wrong dirt road to start the thing. Then the
trail petered out and we followed our nose up through steep, but fairly open
forest for an hour before finally regaining the trail. Here we moved quickly
until reaching the great basin below Bisher and Hoher Fricken. Again, I screwed
up. I saw a faint path leading up to the ridge crest that matched what I took
last time. But last time there was significant spring snow covering the
horrible latschen trees. This time, the path didn't work at all. Finally, while
we struggled in head-high latschen jungle, I looked at my watch. It was late.
We needed to turn back immediately :-(.

Which we did, and to our credit we bombed down very quickly. I don't know the
exact elevation but it's something like 4000 feet and then a long 1/2 mile or
more of flat walking. It took an hour. Thanks to Uli for hurrying back with me!
Just unbelievable how lost I can get...
