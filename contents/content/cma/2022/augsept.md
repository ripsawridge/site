# Tirolerweg (August 11)

On the Plamorder Spitze.

I decided to make an easy day and take the lift up to the
[Tirolerweg Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/tirolerweg-klettersteig/).

I stayed at a nice campground.

Next day, a beautiful hike on Piz Arina across the border in Switzerland.

A cute little sign. It says: "Sure is nice here. *But were you ever
in Baden-Württemberg, hmm?*" And then, the picture of the nice
man seems to indicate that he is saying it. I laughed.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220812_115143~2.jpg.jpg %}
View from the summit of Piz Arina. I love this area.
