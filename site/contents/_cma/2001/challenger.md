Marek, Jake and I were dreaming about Mt. Challenger. The big gentle
glacier. The beautiful rock pyramid. The piton in the one place you need it. The
views of the Pickett Range. Ahh!


Of course, there is the 17 mile approach, the river ford, the
Imperfect Impasse to deal with.  And what about the weather? By
mid-week I was glued to my screen, divining the professionals true
meaning in a cloud of "HI PRSUR CRUMBLNG OVRNGHT W/SNO SHWRS LT
FRI." The weather looked bad, no matter how you sliced it. First,
hope was held out for Sunday, then the sun moved to Monday, and on
Friday, the forecast called for unmitigated sun only on Tuesday. I
panicked, calling Jake and emailing Marek: "ABORT! ABORT! WE SHD CLMB
IN EAST. WEST SCKED IN!!"  But Marek had an optimistic forecast, so
we went ahead.  So we arrived at the trail-head under gray skies at 9
pm Friday. We had brought a tent, expecting some bad weather to clear
out by summit day. Jake's pack was comically large, but seriously
heavy!


We were happy, because it wasn't actually raining, and as darkness
fell we hiked over Hannagan Pass, and down into the Chilliwack
valley. Around 1 am, we reached Copper Creek Camp, and were trying to
sleep by 2. With 8 miles of the approach now behind us, we felt
optimistic about Saturday.

I had no history with this area at all, while Jake and Marek had tried
once before, getting to various points along the trail.  We crossed
the river in Jake's old tennis shoes, then Marek led confidently
through soaking brush to a steep trail in the forest. Probably due to
this brush, his feet were already wet a few hundred feet up from the
river. Still, we were happy, climbing in occasional rain and patches
of blue sky, always the next valley over. We reached the ridge crest,
where I found a "short cut," that merely wasted time in a loose
gully. We scrambled up Easy Peak in a cold wind, and reached Marek's
high point from the year before. We couldn't see more than 200 feet
away in the fog, rain and wind, but Marek used some amazing psychic
powers to lead us on a gentle downward traverse to an area near the
Imperfect Impasse. We came down about 1200 feet in deep grassy slopes,
then rock and snow. Down here, we could see better, and we admired
Perfect Pass, our intended destination for the night.


All we knew about the Imperfect Impasse was that it was a deep gully
that required some technical climbing to cross, or else a 1000 foot
descent and re-climb of the other side. I was determined to find the
technical way, and I had some information about it. We came to the
edge, where Jake and Marek gave me a few minutes to explore. This
thing was pretty scary, and pretty far from home.  At a flat spot by a
tree, I believed I needed to climb up 200 feet on a buttress. I did
this, then worked my way onto very exposed 3rd and 4th class
ground. Everything was wet, and a little foreboding.  This place gave
me the willies! I seemed to be somewhere others had been, since the
handholds had a "used" appearance. I could tell because they were
free of moss, and some dirt had been cleaned out.  I was looking for a
bolt to indicate I was on route, and expecting to find a piton or
two. I also knew that most people didn't even rope up. "It's casual,
don't sweat it." people would say. But I was sweating it. To keep
looking required me to traverse over a frighting drop with minimal
holds, that just got smaller. I decided for my own health, and the
health of the team, that this couldn't be the way. Climbing carefully
down, I wondered what to try next. "That is NOT the way," I said,
eyes bulging, to Marek, who eagerly agreed. Jake was already hiking
down, and Marek took off too.


Now, as we descended an uncomfortable boulder field, we argued hotly
for a while (well, at least I did, everybody else thought I was
insane). I wanted to keep looking for the route, sure that I had
missed it.  As it turns out, Marek's beta indicated that we needed to
get close to the valley floor and ascend the next pass over beyond
Perfect Pass, and this was no place to be wasting time. Being already
a little high-strung from my scrambling adventure, and wet and tired,
I didn't want to lose the hard-won elevation, but I merely succeeded
in frustrating my companions. We agreed to camp at the first available
place down the slope, near the Impasse. We found a suitable tent
platform, and Marek raced off downhill to investigate the route that
Chris and Michael took last year. I raced over and crossed the Impasse
at this easy point, deterred from getting onto the opposite slope by
wet, mossy slabs. But I felt it was possible to go up from this point,
although it looked like a hellish bushwhack. Marek reported success
and we decided to go down that way in the morning. We had taken quite
a bruising as a team, with both Marek and I strongly believing we each
knew the way to get to the glacier. But Marek's excellent Borscht soup
and a hot meal brought us together again.


In the morning, the sky was clear! Wonder of wonders, we were quite
happy! We geared up, had a few sips of borscht, and hiked down towards
the wild valley floor. Marek had scouted a likely place to cut across
the brush, and we set off into an evil bushwhack. It would have been
ok if it were dry, but the trees were dripping, and before long we
were soaked! Perhaps this is the theme of our trip? We cursed at the
cold streams of water filling our boots, and found ourselves halted by
the Imperfect Impasse when the brush ended in cliffs.  Jake had had
enough, and I think we were all doubtful about climbing to a high pass
under the icefalls and gray cliffs of the valley head. We beat the
brush back to our tent to regroup.


Our initial optimism was replaced by desperation. "It's okay, we've
still got time!" Jake and I had gained a blinding faith in a new idea
for crossing the Imperfect Impasse high up. We decided I was exploring
too low, and by climbing up to the top of a buttress, we would
definitely find the route. I think Marek rolled his eyes at this, but
we huffed and puffed our way back up and began searching again. Jake
and I took different lines.  After 30 minutes, we had come up empty
again. Back we went to my line of the evening before, and we just
succeeded in scaring ourselves enough to give up. We did find a sling
and a 'biner high on an outcrop, but no sign of a feasible
route. Disillusioned and heartbroken, we joined Marek and mournfully
decided to hike out. For Marek, this defeat was most crushing. I
mostly felt guilty for advocating a route strongly, then not being
able to find/complete it. The emotion of sadness and resignation was
great for us all.


We climbed back to Easy Ridge with our gear, the only incident being
that I fell on mossy rocks down a smooth streambed. But the sun was
out, and the views were glorious. For the first time, I was smiling,
having temporarily forgotten the heavy pack and the crushing
defeat. Mt. Blum looked really nice, and the North Face of Mt. Shuksan
was ominous. The more so because it was being engulfed by black clouds
that came our way fast. Abruptly, the weather window had closed, and
we were back to Gore-Tex and slogging in wind and rain. We wanted to
get off the ridge-top in case the storm became violent. I went ahead at
this point, and blazed all the way down to the Chilliwack River
without stopping. I used Jake's old shoes to cross, then Marek
appeared. I threw a shoe to him, but we both stood surprised when the
shoe reached the middle of the stream and floated away. Then I threw
the other one, and it didn't make the shore either.  What was wrong
with me? I was as puzzled as Marek must have been. So Marek and Jake
had to cross in socks, and I endured ribbing about throwing lessons
for a while.


Anyway, by this point we were all completely soaked, and had to walk
10 miles over Hannagan Pass to the car.  This was a very difficult
portion of the day. The constant rain brought new water in, and there
was no chance to dry inside with body heat. By the time we reached the
pass, I was a little bit fearful of hypothermia.  I had really slowed
down, and noticed Jake and Marek were keeping an eye on me. Despite
wearing all my clothes and hiking uphill, I was cold. But having made
the pass, I felt I could get down the other side with some effort. I
took off as fast as I could, thinking about dry clothes at the car. We
had all been humbled by this weather. None of us had ever been so wet
and cold before. I reached the car at 10:10, and shivered for 10
minutes until Jake came with the key.


We'll all stand on top of Challenger one day, it just didn't happen
last weekend. Thanks to Jake and Marek for their excellent
companionship!
