Barbara and I hiked up Hochries for the first time. We discovered amazing [crags in the
forest](https://www.stadler-markus.de/klettern/lamprechtsfels.html), and even met the main pair of dudes who are setting routes on them. Later
we heard them drilling and setting new routes. Really cool.

We climbed up and down several grade II+/III- lines on this cliff:

Here we are at the top of Hochries in strong wind. We both got pretty tired by the
long low-angle trek across rocks on the summit ridge. Boah!

Here is Mara in that rocky stretch, happy like clam:

On the steep trail down to middle meadowlands:
