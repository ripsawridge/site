Well. It's been tough to write about this. It's been almost half a year
since it happened. I wondered why it's taken this long. I realize it's
because I wanted to be "completely better" before I told the story.
That would be a more secure place for me. However, I have to accept
there may be no such day.

The good news up front. Jong is fine, though losing his glasses was very
annoying! He had to get stitches for the cut above his eye, and he had
to endure a night of me complaining and occasionally yelling in the hospital,
which I wouldn't wish on anyone!

Also, I'm "fine" too. I got a calcaneus fracture in my right foot, and now
have 6 or so big screws in there. It looks like a block of wood in
beginner shop class under the x-ray. Within a year, I should be able to get
those screws removed. It hurts to walk very far, though I did manage to
run the other day when I was late for my passport renewel appointment.
Stressed out, but pleasantly surprised!

The main takeaway is that we are the architects of our experience. However,
we run our lives in a frame of support and occasional rebuke, whether from
higher parts of "ourselves" or "some other" it is hard to tell from here.
The sense of presence, of consciousness...certainly concerned, but not overly
so, is palpable to me. What follows are my impressions, and I know Jong
will roll his eyes somewhat at them. He keeps things practical and on the
ground, and has my enormous thanks for being a climbing partner, a vigorous
debating partner and a true friend!

## The Day

We were very excited, because in a week we'd go to climb the Nordgrat
of the Piz Badile, and begin the long awaited Alps vacation. As usual, we
hiked up at a brutal pace to climb the Predigtstuhl Nordkante, and possibly
something else if we had time. We left one pack at the base of the route and
started up, passing a couple of parties with simul-climbing. A couple of
cool dudes recognized me from my orange helmet and said "hey are you the
Mountainwerks guy?" That was fun! We travelled near each other for a while
in the really delightful crack pitches where the wall goes vertical.
Then Jong and I travelled in coils up to regain the ridge at a notch.
I think we were arguing about politics in here. How wonderful it is and how 
lucky we are to be able to do that!

We stuffed ourselves awkwardly into the Oppelband, continuing our discussion.
As I inched my way forward, one hand pawing at loose stones and my body
trying to fall out, eyes looking at the people walking up the switchbacks
far below, I argued that Trumpism is continually misunderstood and
mischaracterized by a media class that lectures without any understanding
of what their chosen policies do on the ground far away from coastal
enclaves. "People think he is supported because of his brash or 'rude'
statements, but his support comes in *spite* of them because no one
else articulated 'America First,' which in any other nation would be seen
as a dutiful expression of national interest in a time of
ballooning debt, instead of a dark and
dramatic 'turn towards fascism,'" I hollered around the corner.

Jong talked about the necessity to face sometimes painful realities, such
as the demise of coal and the disappearance of earlier modes of life.
He grew up in a coal mining region of Germany. His dad was a miner. He knows
more about that life than I do, and spoke with integrity about the need
for national policies that don't only cater to one group, because such promises
will ultimately be broken!

Or at least I think that's what he said, but his voice was somewhat muffled
because he was speaking into the loose pebbles in front of him as he crawled,
plus my belay was around a corner, one pitch below the summit.

*Writing this now, later, when I don't know the shape of my life in the
mountains going forward...I'm struck by the freedom and joy in such days!*

Shortly after our struggle with the Oppelband, right below the summit.

Soon we stood on the summit, happy beings! We started the abseils down
the Botzong Kamin, and I already began arguing to continue the day. Jong was
rather tired. I argued that we should do one more short climb on the basis
that the extra training would benefit us next week on the Piz Badile.
Jong agreed. My gosh, if I had been less of a martinet and listened to
my friend!

We got to the little basin below the abseils, and crabbed our way over to the
side to inspect the "Westschlucht" route. "Well, I guess this is it," I said. It looked
a bit loose and dubious. At least, the initial wall was steep but there were
plenty of loose rocks around too. We decided to leave our other pack here,
as it should be a trip up and down of just a couple hours.

The first pitch was quite exciting. Some tough moves, but also, alarmingly,
stacked blocks of loose rock. In one case I placed a cam in a crack just to
keep the rope away from one such block-stack for when Jong came up below it.
My belay was improvised and awkward, atop a set of stalagtites below a
yellowish face.

Jong came up carefully, knocking off one block-stack near the crux, and
successfully avoiding the upper one. Hmm. Well, okay, it should get easier.

The next pitch was more straightforward. Go up easy ground to a belay on
the buttress. This intersects with another (steep!) route. I think I had
a piton and a cam for the belay. From here, the job was to go around the
corner and get into a wide gully that leads to the summit. I think the
route is named for this feature. Jong sent me off, and I traversed grade III
terrain down then up and down again. This would be terrible for rope
drag! Finally I was in the gully with tons of rope drag. I would have to
belay no matter what. There was an enormous (Smart-car sized) block wedged
into a constriction with a rope around it. Standing in a little niche
below it, I saw it was an obvious belay spot. I craned my neck to look above,
thinking that a belay might be found in a niche directly above this block.
But that would require about 4 more meters of climbing and I just didn't
have enough rope. I tested the fixed rope around the block with full weight,
and decided to trust it for an anchor. I reasoned that I was also in a niche
that could offer body-belay opportunities if Jong were to pull on the rope
through a fall.

About 30 minutes before the accident. Jong is saying "FU" to the
whole thing of "let's climb another route!"

It took a long time for Jong to come around the corner, and I was always
laboriously pulling in rope. It turned out that his experience was that of
seeing the rope lying there in piles along the traverse. He finally took
up the slack and tied in short. Rope-drag pitches are no fun in this way.
It's like, everybody works hard and no one is safe!

Jong came up and we sorted out the rope. There was one real pitch to the summit,
with a bit of grade IV, and rather long. I started up, climbing directly up
the wedged block because piles of loose rock were on either side.

Something was wrong though. Why was I falling?

The block was tipping! Making a horrible crunching sound the block tipped,
I fell on Jong, then the ground with a sharp pain in my foot. The air was filled
with a rending noise that made it impossible to think. Jong was yelling and
I bet I was too. Now sitting in the niche I knew the block had fallen, and
mentally braced for the last breathe of life because I knew we were tied to
the block and when the slack rope finally paid out Jong and then I would be
mercilessly yanked into the depths.

Anticipated violence is felt at a deep level. Below us were 700 meters of chimneys
and caverns winnowing into darkness.

I read somewhere that evil spirits are attached to comets, perhaps as a
kind of metaphysical prison. Or perhaps it is the last place in a universe
where they can maintain some hold. Their essence long ago became one of rejection,
of saying no to what is natural and moving away from union. Perhaps, from
a gollum-like existence on one planet or another through a series of lives,
the strength of the will-to-no is great enough that they are flung from
planets into space. Maybe the comet is a place of reconsideration.

Either way, it is the end.

I felt the reality of spiritual death more than a mere physical death.
Horrible. Incredibly horrible.

But we were not dragged. No malevolent force harried us. The awful crashing
and echoing slowly died away, leaving the cries of observers from the
great Steinere Rinne below in its wake. They knew something had happened.
They probably heard our cries mixed with the crashing noise.

German has a very good word for this: *lärm*, pronounced Laerhm, reminding me
of "alarm."

Jong lost his glasses when I landed on him, and he had a cut above one eye
that meant he just saw blurry red shapes. I was sitting in the niche and holding
onto his leg. I was pretty nicely jammed in so if we weren't going to be pulled
off I felt pretty safe. Jong was standing and was acutely aware that we must
not be connected to the mountain. He shouted down to the voices below that
they should call for a rescue. They heard. It was a great hot summer day,
and the walls were actually alive with climbers, though too small to see.
I marvelled at what a noise and mess and trouble we'd be causing!

It was a good thing though that there is no popular route below us. There was
only a more seldom-travelled route climbing up to the previous belay point.
I couldn't imagine where that enormous block ended up.

Jong picked up a frayed piece of yellow rope. It was the anchor rope! It had
been destroyed when the block cantilevered out of the wall. That was what
saved us.

It took a while, but finally I got three cams into cracks around me and we
were tied in. The pain in my foot was throbbing. We heard a helicopter and
soon they were hovering across from us and checking us out. We made a
few hand signals, only wanting to indicate that we did need help but
we weren't in a life-threatening situation now. They flew away.

Jong and I conversed in that way that happens after something crazy. Glad
to be alive, thankful that neither was hurt too bad. Wondering how all this
happened. He said I had a really big butt, as thats what hit him in the
face, and this got us laughing heartily.

The helicopter came back and within seconds a man appeared on a long steel
cable. He hovered in right next to us and conversed a bit. Once he was sure
things were stable, he said to disconnect from the wall (craftly, I took my
cams with me: they are expensive, you know!) after connecting a sling to
him. Then, suddenly, all three of us were lifted up, out and away from the
wall.

It was a dreamlike experience to hover over the Wilder Kaiser. The colors
of everything were verdant, deep. The plunging verticality was intense.
They flew us to the little lawn at the Stripsenjochhütte, setting us down.
Other rescue personal came and unhooked us from the line and started going
over me carefully. Then the helicopter landed beside us.

At this point another story begins, where I'm not the main character.
I'm just a resevoir of life that main characters work to preserve and
protect. The rescuers in the helicopter and the man on the line. The
concerned doctor on the ground, setting me at ease with her many questions.
Later the police investigator, who managed to round up our gear from
the two cache sites on the mountain, allowing us to drive home after
a night in the hospital at St. Johann.

Later still, the surgeons at the hospital in Ebersberg.

Throughout all this stuff Jong was a humorous, teasing and happy
presence and I can't thank him enough.

As it became clear that recovery would take a long, very long time, Barbara
was there always. She cleaned my apartment, got me groceries, gave me
her constant love. Broke me out of the hospital to eat cheesecake and
drink beer.

I'm absolutely blessed. The accident was my fault, and I am paying for it.
But all around me no one wants me to suffer. Everyone wants me to be okay.
I can't say thank you enough to all these hands that appear and just want
to make my life easier. Take the world of insurance, for example. I can
feel the goodness of people who process my application, who make sure
I get some money back. I didn't fill out all those forms! I think I should
pay to some degree.

Life will change because it must. Thank you.
