The alarm was loud, almost horrifying. Not that we slept much. But we were going
to do this. As much apprehensive as excited? Yes. We felt ready for the full
Exum Ridge, but just barely. Did we feel ready to do the climb in a day? Aided
by Jeff's blithe assurances, part of me mouthed a confident "yes!" But the inner
me quailed!  And yet this was an opportunity: I resolved to be dogged, oblivious
to pain, and refuse to worry about problems not right in front of me. We
resolved to spend Wednesday as lazily as possible! I slept and ate, occasionally
listening to CDs, and reading Jeff's library of mountain books.  Steve did the
same, testing and learning from his knee injury. We both worried about it. We
knew it could easily call off the climb with painful twinges, felt but not
mentioned at first.  So his knee was kind of a 3rd partner, hopefully a
cooperative one!


Why in a day? Ah, it's not that we wanted to. The ranger station was a
helpful place, but mostly helpful in telling early-risen hopefuls that
every campground in the canyon was full: from the low 8000 foot high
camps at the mouth, to the Lower Saddle at 11,000 ft.  We were urged
to see the sights of Jackson, and "come back tomorrow" for a better
prognosis. Well meaning advice and crafty excuses from fellow climbers
were heaped upon us, but we couldn't bear even the possibility of
being turned back at a high point because we broke the rules. Our only
choice was to start walking at 2 am, and hope to somehow make it back
to the car the same day.

We saw brilliant stars as we crept up from the basement. Steve drove
us to the park, and we began to walk immediately. Setting a moderate
pace, the hours sped by, with occasional glimpses of a light below us,
or a dimly felt lake on the left. The switchbacks were long and
gentle, probably for the best, but mentally irritating.  We passed
hours talking about Kris and Sarah, who we missed quite a bit in the
lonely corridor of lamplight, rock and grass we traveled.


Finally we entered the canyon, and in the pitch dark, we lost the
trail in a boulder-field.  Another night traveler came up, and the
three of us stumbled up and deeper into the canyon. Now it was
raining, and I broke a hiking pole when a boulder tottered. I wanted
to go down or up, but Steve and our companion wanted to keep
traversing on a level.  We knew that eventually we'd hit the trail as
it climbed steeply to the Petzold Caves.  I was really impatient with
this delay and the worsening weather. Finally, we hit trail again,
climbing quickly for a while in the dark. We lost the track again, and
an odd character appeared out of the gloom, pointed in the right
direction, and faded away. He must have been heading to Irene's Arete,
or somewhere less visited by the direction he traveled. He also wore
all white, and carried no pack!



We climbed above the Caves in a gray light. This area was beautiful,
even now, with streams, greenery and attractive boulders. Soon, the
entire way to the Upper Saddle was visible: a rocky moraine with
scattered tents, then a dark cliff with a reputed fixed rope. At the
first camp we chatted with the rising occupants. It was already nearly
full light, and we had promised to be at the base of the Lower Exum
Ridge by now.  Also, the sky was forbidding up ahead. Blackest above
the Saddle, the clouds at least remained high enough to see the entire
peak. We knew we needed to hurry, and to make our day less
ambitious. We decided to climb the Upper Exum, and save the Lower for
another day. The most technical climbing is on the Lower Exum Ridge,
with 7 pitches of 5.7 climbing. You can bypass it with a broad ledge
called Wall Street. Of course, the climbing is historic and excellent,
so we hated to give up any of it. Still, Jeff had advised us to
definitely visit the summit, and skip the lower ridge if we had
to. Having made up our mind, we left some cams and Steve's bivy sack
at this camp.


At this point, Steve began to feel the effects of altitude. He slowed
down. I was surprised that it didn't affect me, but the hike to
Teewinot earlier in the week must have done a lot. We came to the base
of the cliff, and used the huge fixed rope to scramble up. It was a
fun novelty, I'd never seen a "fixed rope!" A few hundred feet more,
and we were among camps of the Lower Saddle. We got some water here,
ate "turkey jerky" and drank as much as we could. The sky was black in
Idaho, and didn't bode well for an attempt. But the guides huts stood
empty: they had taken their clients. Many others sat in their tents,
or even glumly packed up and went down.



But it wasn't raining, and even as we sat, the sky turned from black
to dark gray. The wind was low, and we saw no lightening. Steve's knee
felt a-ok, only his lungs worked overtime in the thin air. I felt
really good. We headed up, knowing we could easily turn around up to
Wall Street ledge. Identifying the start of the Lower Exum Ridge, we
passed it with a pang of sadness, and continued up the black dike,
going to the left of a spire, and into a rocky defile. We looked to
the right for "The Eye of the Needle," of which we could only guess
which of several possibilities this was. Finally, we climbed across a
difficult, exposed face and met the only four people we'd see on the
whole climb.  A guide, belaying 3 clients from a fixed pin, prepared
to send them across the face.  They let us climb past first, and soon
we were on easier ground, clambering to the beautiful crest of a ridge
among large blocks. Here, we saw Wall Street and the Upper Exum, all
teeth soaring to a faraway summit. Hiking down, then up, we got onto
the Wall Street ledge. We roped up for an exposed but easy
"step-across," which Petzoldt leaped on his daring solo ascent in the
1930s. Then I continued up on the "Golden Stair," unprotected but
frictiony golden rock.


From here, exact memories elude me, but I can say that this portion of
the ridge involves considerable climbing. We expected to simul-climb
or unrope for much of the ascent, but in fact, belayed most of the
ridge. We were gratified at the sporting climbing, since we thought
all the good climbing was on the Lower Exum - not so!  It was never
difficult, but always clean and satisfying.


After about an hour and a half, we were on the crest of the ridge,
looking at several possibilities for the rest of the way. We seemed to
have missed the (in)famous "Friction Pitch" that guidebooks make so
much of. Faced with a steep wall with huge exposure looking off the
ridge (there was a fixed pin here), and a crack then a steep
(overhangs) but knobby face to the right, we chose the latter. I was
glad for the overhang practice on Symmetry Spire two days before! This
was the most intense pitch, as it felt quite hard (5.7) for the
location, and my paltry gear selection was soon used up. Also, the
clouds moved in, and I felt surrounded by gray. The splattering of
raindrops increased the isolation, and made me wonder if an epic was
approaching! After a few dicey moves, I finished the pitch with 20
feet of knobby 5.4 climbing on a beautiful ridge-crest. I distinctly
remember a choice here, with a mundane, protect-able chimney, or this
striking crest.  It was too beautiful to pass up! I got a picture of
Steve coming up this, and for the mix of rock, ice and cloud, it's one
of my favorites.


Steve was doing good, although concerned about the weather. We
hunkered down for a few minutes to see what might happen. We knew we
could down-climb everything so far, if we needed to. We were wearing
everything we had, Steve even had his warm hat on underneath his
helmet. After talking about the climb for a few minutes, and
marveling at the position, the weather began to improve. Over the
next hour or two, this continued, until we had a beautiful afternoon!

From here, the climbing eased, allowing us to scramble for a ways. A
large yellow, low angled face led us left to the crest again. From
here we down-climbed into a little basin and belayed below an icy, wet
crack. I dealt with this awkwardly, and soon Steve and I were hiking
to the summit block. A little bit of icy scrambling, and we were on
the summit, at 13,440 feet! This was a height record for us both! "One
crowded hour of glorious life."


A highlight was the excellent sandwich we had each packed. There was
no one around, and it felt surreal to be spreading mayonnaise on bread
here, with this sky and earth.  Time sped by, and after we had tried
out various reclining positions, we started down.


We had a rough idea of the direction to go, and occasional bootprints
and the low angled terrain made it easy to progress. Finally we came
to a rappel station on our left. We did this rappel, expecting to
reach the Upper Saddle momentarily.  However, we had wandered too far
left, and could have down-climbed another way.  We discovered this when
we ended up below the real rap station at a cliff, and had to climb
back up to it. We had only one rope, so this required two rappels with
an intermediate station. We pulled a small but powerful rock down as
we freed the rope on the last rappel. "Whoa," said Steve.


We knew we were both getting tired, and the three rappels had been
time-consuming.  Now we had a long trip down from the Upper Saddle. I
never expected it to be so difficult! There were endless loose and
steep gullies, route-finding errors, and finally a vexing problem in
the vicinity of the "Eye of the Needle," terrain we hardly recognized
from the morning. This time we went through the Eye, which was an
intriguing cave. Steve pioneered a tricky down-climb from a ledge here,
and gradually we got to easier terrain. But curiously, the hut at the
Lower Saddle never seemed to get closer, it was just
scree/scramble/downclimb for 1500 feet more.


So, the sane could finish their day at the Saddle with cups of water!
But we kept going. I descended the fixed rope strenuously, kind of
like a rappel, then stupidly watched Steve down-climb easily, just
keeping the rope handy in case he needed it.  "Oh." Whatever, I was
becoming brain-dead.


Curiously, as we tramped down the Moraine, Steve and I both discussed
seeing a "phantom climber" off to the side of us during the tricky
climb down from the Upper Saddle.  For me, it was a brown-haired man
in a red cotton sweatshirt and jeans. It did seem that the very long
day was having an effect on us! But this {\em phantom} was somehow
comforting. Later I told Peter about it, and he's read about the
phenomenon.


By the time we passed the Caves, which were above a beautiful alpine
rock garden, my feet were bruised from the miles of rock. We were
amazed at the vast terrain we had scrambled off-trail in the dark so
many {\em years} before. The trail got tricky to keep in the fading
daylight as we crossed the boulder-field near the canyon exit. Here we
turned on the headlamps, crossing a long rockfall, then reaching the
meadowy hillsides outside the canyon. I tried to deaden my mind to
the pain of each footfall, and gradually succumbed to intense yearning
to stop! Finally, Steve went on ahead, and I took off my boots and lay
like a horse on the moonlit trail. Listening to wind and throbbing
feet, I somehow fell asleep for about 10 minutes.  I awoke, feeling
much refreshed, and gained a steely resolve to finish it in one
push. The nap had done wonders for my attitude, and marching and
whistling, I briskly passed a mile. Then I heard a wolf howling in the
darkness, which was pretty creepy! Soon though, I reached
Steve. Thankfully, he was the wolf, crooning to himself for dim,
private reasons. I left him howling, and tromped ahead, annoyed at the
long almost-flat stretches of trail.


Now it was midnight. But I was at the car.  And I had no key, so I lay
again like a dying horse in the moonlight.


{\em Many thanks to Steve for his excellent companionship and solid
judgment. We both enjoyed the climb tremendously, but we wouldn't do
it in a day again! Great thanks to Jeff, too, who somehow convinced us
we'd reach the car before dark.  Optimistically, I always believe
him!}
