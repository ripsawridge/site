We had an awesome trip! We stayed in the Haus Ascott, had a nice apartment
where, shocked by the high prices in Switzerland, we resolved to cook every
meal. This turned out to be one of the most fun things. Kris invented a
dish with chicken wrapped in bacon. Mmm. Lots of red peppers and onions
too. Man it was good. Had many adventures with the boys, including a long
hike down a mountain ('bout 500 feet elevation descent, not too shabby
for 3 year olds I think).
  
### Solo hike log

First a 45 minute jog in Chur, Switzerland, going up from our pension on trail
that reminded me of Tiger Mountain. Some views of snowy peaks eventually
attained. Then, 3 hikes in Zermatt. First a "blitz" up to the best view point
of the Matterhorn I know. Down another way to a hut with cake. Then on the same
valley wall further south, in some clouds. Circled around to the same hut.
Finally, a late afternoon hike up to the Schwarzsee from town. Tried to reach
the Hornlihuette, but too much wet, sliding snow turned me back a few hundred
meters from it. Still a great hike in good weather with sunset on the way down.

Finally, did the Munich half-marathon "off the couch" (at least, no running
training). It kind of hurt! Came in at 1 hour 59 minutes!
