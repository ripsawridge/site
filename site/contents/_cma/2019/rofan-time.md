## Sunday

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up the Spieljoch from Maurach. It was good fun, though
we were both tired. She had a headache all the day before, and so did I, though
not as bad.

## Monday

Georg and I returned to the region at my insistence...it was just really cool
and I wanted to go back. He balked with (understandable) fears of traffic jams.
However, there was no worry about Sunday Münchners out for a drive -- it was
raining when we met at Holzkirchen, and continued sprinkling most of the way.

About five minutes into the hike, Georg took off, basically running up the
steep slope. I joined him "in spirit" but moseyed along at my own slower
pace. What a crazy trail -- 60 degree forested slopes. They look really
scary as you look down. Barbara and I were [here before](../2016/brandenburg.html).
After the steep trail, I enjoyed *Apfelstruedel* and *Milchkaffee* at the
Bayreuther Hütte. After a few minutes walking above the hut, I met Georg
screaming down. We agreed to meet later. He went and took a nap in a meadow
and woke up with 7 ticks on him! Oh man...I hate losing the meadows...I love them!

Passing a host of bleating sheep, I climbed steeply to the summit of the
Vorderes Sonnwendjoch (2224 m). Boy, I was tired here. But the weather had
cleared up nicely and there were views all around.

I hurried down, found Georg, and we decided to jog down the road which runs
east of our steep ascent trail. We were scared of slipping on the oily, wet
roots above 60 degree wet grass -- yikes!

We joked about the blood-fed darkling blooms of the Edelweiss on the steep and
trecherous slopes of the Allgäu, determining that they only bloom in full
glory when fed by sacrifice. We surmised that the fire-pits of Reutte in
pre-Christian times were tended by fallen Druids of the "left-hand path."

Later, we talked of more cheerful things, like global civilizational collapse.
Of the failure of the *Energiewende* in the most committed, wealthy and idealistic
country to attempt it. Of the blindness of our discourses (economic, political, social)
to the fossil fuels which underlay everything that happens to such an extent that they
are invisible.

Of the need to live, and rejoice in primary experience. After all, just because we
wound ourselves into complexity we cannot manage, doesn't mean we intended harm.
On our good days, we do love, and love well.

* *Spieljoch:* 1200 meters up and down.
