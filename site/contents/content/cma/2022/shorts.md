### Vorderunnütz
_February 3, 2022_

Pretty wonderful ski tour. I chose it because it's safe when avalanche
danger, as it is now. Foolishly, I parked at a lot in Steinberg am Rofan
which required 5 euros
for the day, but if I had walked 30 seconds away, I would have seen
where all the savvy people park for free. I asked one of the men who
parked at the free lot if it was necessary to pay. He said he didn't
think so, but then again, he added -- he is a member of the village!

So at least I made one person happy. It is fun to feel part of a private
club. In his case, he *knows* he'd never get a ticket there because
the people are like family. Me being a stranger, and reminding him that
there are those who feel insecure in the world because they are unknown,
allowed him to feel warm and even loved. Good!

I skinned up this small ski area, only about 250 meters elevation gain.
But it was well-maintained by just two operators. At the top I looked
at the map and saw that I'd have to do a kind of strange trip around
the back side of a mountain to continue my route. My friend from the
morning asked to be sure I knew the way, and I said goodbye to him.

A pleasant couple of hours followed, skinning on flat and gently
ascending trails, finally reaching first one log cabin and then another,
at which I was able to sit down on a window sill and stand on a bench
in front of the cabin. The snow was so high! While I drank tea, my
head dodged beams in the rafters of the porch roof. The sun was
burning through low clouds.

Higher, I got above the trees and had quite a route-finding challenge.
There were no tracks. I only saw sign of other skiers from the prior
week near the summit which was wind-scoured ice. But down here I had
to make my way on awkward traverses, sometimes climbing too high
into little *latschen* groves. I checked the map often, and mostly
traversed west and then south, trying to check my urge to climb too
steeply and prematurely.

Higher still, I could finally interpret the terrain. I made switchbacks
up a shoulder to a ridge on very nice snow, not deep powder, but a
powdery layer over a reasonably firm base. I traveled on a ridgetop,
then climbed after a slight descent onto the icy summit ridge. Conditions
were very different here, and I stopped to put on a jacket against
the strong wind coming from the north and west. Now I could see the
Achensee. My summit was beset by *enormous* cornices. They had a kind
of dual architecture: the usual inverted mushrooms, but this time
supported by strong leaning columns of snow. It was unusual. I stayed
well back from them on the final bit to the summit!

All the mountains were gorgeous and quite snowy. The Karwendel peaks
looked especially black and frightening with their snowy gullies and
improbable faces.

The ski of the upper mountain went very quickly and was very pleasant
as well. I only saw in my guidebook later that I had an option to go
straight down to the south which would have eliminating much traversing,
and much tedium later in the region of the cabins. However, the book
also says that way had more avalanche danger and so I'm glad I didn't
play with it. Again I drank tea in the roof-rafters of the higher
cabin, then, tiring, went through the ups and downs to reach the
little ski lift. From there, the descent was smooth and easy.

A great day! Something around 1100 meters up and down.

### Pletzachkogel and Roßkogel
_January 4, 2022_

Very interesting hike. Steeply up to a small (inhabited!) cabin
in a meadow with a Charlie-Brown-esque Christmas bush, then
on a steep road and trail to the Pletzachkogel summit. From
there over to a kind of abandoned ski area compound, and with
snowshoes steeply up to the high abandoned lift station.
I peered inside the windows of the adjoining hut to see a rack
of kettleballs and "WOD" (workout of the day) notations on a
chalkboard. It's some kind of revanchist "body kultur" hideout!

I'm only kidding -- seems really cool. Anyway, the final climb
to the summit of the Roßkogel was interesting. I scrambled up
a rocky ridgecrest with a rather difficult step. Meanwhile an
extremely agile man came bounding down the ridge and batmanned
through the latschen trees in an area of similar difficulty
20 meters to my left. In fact, I saw many people this day (8 or 10?).

Aside from the radio tower on the summit, it's a neat place.
There are likely no better viewpoints of Guffert.

1600 meters up and down.

Just above the steep road in the forest, we come out on the slopes
of Pletzachkogel.
