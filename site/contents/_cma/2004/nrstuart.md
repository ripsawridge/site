Everyone has a climb that represents a milestone to them. Enhanced
emotion, amazement, fear, or just long planning can give an ascent a
mythic quality. My first climb of this nature was the West Ridge of
Mt. Stuart. Steve and I went up there with our minimal competence and
maximal gear, looking at the guidebook every few paces in case we got
off route. Steve took a leader fall high on the mountain, and we spent
an unplanned night out with the freezing moon.

Other "great peaks" for some reason have been Mt. Index North Peak,
The Sassalungo with Mat and Piz Pordoi with Kris, Mesachie Peak,
Fairview Dome, The Ptarmigan Traverse, and now, I think, the North
Ridge of Mt. Stuart.

I arrived at Theron's house Tuesday at 3:30 in the afternoon, fresh from a
red-eye trip to Houston. My grandfather of 94 years died, and it was important
for me to go to the funeral. He was a great old man, and will be missed,
especially by my own father who cared for him in his final (10+?) years. I wish
I made efforts to talk to him more in these last years.

Theron and I talked, deciding at the last minute to come in over
Ingall's Pass rather than Mountaineer's Creek because of reports that
the Sherpa Glacier was breaking up and becoming troublesome. Anyway,
it would be a nice change from Mountaineer's Creek, which we'd been up
several times already this year. I hadn't been over Ingall's Pass in 5
years!

We took bivy sacks and light sleeping bags to crash in near Ingall's
Lake, where we would leave gear for pickup later. For the route we
took lightweight crampons and an axe. I considered these essential in
retrospect. I know people are always making do with a sharp stick, or
such things as one crampon on the downhill foot only. But they are so
light that it's worth taking them for me. We climbed on a doubled 60
meter 8.5 millimeter rope, that turned out to work very well. Our rack
had a dozen nuts, 10 slings, and 11 cams, including a
3.5-Camelot-sized Metolius cam for the offwidth on the Gendarme. We
kept that stowed in the pack until needed, and it was nice to have at
that point. Our boots were light hikers, and we took comfortable rock
shoes for the climbing.

Getting out of town was hard, we were delayed by various problems on
my part. I had needed gear scattered between two cars, one of which
Kris had at work. Also, my own car keys were locked in that car from
the red-eye flight the night before. I got lucky and found a spare
key, drove to work, took the keys from Kris's purse, opened the car,
got my sleeping bag, etc. And all this after I was already late to
arrive at Theron's house. We finally got completely out of town around
4 pm. Oh and I had to buy food - it just goes on and on! I was a very
ill-prepared partner...

We started hiking around 6:30, and reached our designated campsite on the far
side of Ingall's Lake before dark. The mosqitoes were crazy, I finally used bug
juice, which I haven't used in years. They buzzed around but quit biting me for
the night. Sleeping off and on, the night was clear and stars were beautiful.

We got up at 4:15, packed and started walking at 4:45. We were just
able to see without headlamps. We followed a faint trail down and
towards Stuart Pass, eventually losing it in a meadow. No matter -
easy terrain took us gently up to the pass again. We marched up the
ridge which became steep, requiring a little bit of scrambling and
back-tracking. A defined trail took us to a high point just below the
West Ridge of Mt. Stuart. Views of surrounding peaks became really
good here. We stomped down on scree and snow onto a boulderfield below
the steep Northwest wall of the peak, then worked our way back up to
reach Goat Pass. It was kind of a lot of work to here, but we were at
7800 feet, and didn't have to lose any more elevation. We put on
crampons to cross the glacier over to the notch which would gain the
crest of the North Ridge. We saw two people bivied on a rock
outcropping halfway across the glacier. They looked at us too.

It was very easy crossing the glacier with crampons. After 5 minutes
of exciting political discussion (something about Nader being propped
up by smirking right-wing groups?), we joined the pair on their
outcrop, and chatted for a while. They were also climbing the North
Ridge. One of them had climbed it 5 times already, and just really
enjoyed showing it to new people. We kept walking, soon realizing that
we had been counting on finding some water somewhere before the
ridge. I was almost out of water already!

We heard burbling in the jumble of ice chunks just uphill, and though
it appeared dubious I convinced us to head up there a hundred feet or
so. Amid ice chunks and a big moat we happily found a stream that was
reasonable to get to. I climbed into a little ice cave and filled our
Camelbacks. With this work out of the way, we could easily climb snow
in the gully.

We had both forgotten gloves on this trip, so I was a little
apprehensive about steep snow and frozen fingers. But the slope was
very reasonable (40 degrees max?). Higher up, we got out of the
central gully and climbed a sub-gully on the left after removing
crampons. There were a few low-5th class moves on solid rock here,
kind of exciting in boots. Still, we were at the notch in a matter of
minutes, flaking out the rope and changing into rock shoes. The
outcrop party began climbing the gully, possibly belaying fixed
pitches.

Theron and I were really excited to be here. I especially had wanted
to climb this route for a few years. Each year, something would come
up. Last year, it was late-season fires that closed access to the
area. It felt really great to finally be at "The Notch," so often
wondered about!

I started off, climbing easy ground up and slightly right to avoid a
sort of licheny headwall. Soon I realized I would be on ledges
avoiding the crest if I continued this way, so at a likely looking
long double crack I started steeply up. The cracks accepted good
protection despite the occasional festive growing plant lodged
inside. On top, I set a belay in stacked blocks and videotaped Theron
coming up. We've been taking Theron's videocamera on just about every
climb lately. It's really fun to watch a movie later. I always worry
about moving too slow with the camera, but we've done pretty well so
far. One downside is that I take less pictures, so my set of slides
from recent climbs is somewhat aneamic. But all in all, it's fun. I
could do hands-free belaying with the Petzl Reverso, and zoom in on
Theron jamming and stemming his way up to the crest. The only lame
thing is that union regulations require us to take a cameraman even
though we'll do all the filming ourselves. Jim sat beside me in a
"Dark Crystal" T-shirt, sighing loudly.

Theron took off, going below a tower then up to a golden granite
wall. I gave him a fixed belay from here, so he could enjoy steep
climbing on cracks and nubbins.  He continued along for a while while
I followed the steep moves. It was a great pitch. Soon I caught him
belaying at a block below big granite flakes heading back and skyward
on the ridge. I wedged myself between two blocks, then launched into a
glorious hand-traverse. I was flung skyward by the sheer rightness of
it all! "Now we see why it's a classic!" We had to take some pictures
of this pitch, wanting to burn the memory in fiercely.

I belayed somewhere or another, and Theron led the last long bit of
climbing to the base of the Great Gendarme. First there was a tower to
downclimb, then a famous low-angle slab to walk up, then another great
section of hand traversing on the ridge. Wouldn't it be cool if the
whole ridge was one long hand-traverse? We passed a few bivy sites in
this area, and continued up the slab to the rappel station.

Now we had our choice: to Gen Darme or not? We hauled the big cam for
it, so Gen Darme it is!! Of course I had to tape up, just by way of
delaying the inevitable scariness. We ate some food, looking out at a
sunny morning. It was probably around 10:30 am, and the Ice Cliff
Glacier was booming and collapsing. The first Gendarme pitch has three
distinct sections seperated by ledges. I would get a good piece as
high as possible, then lieback upwards for a few moves, sometimes get
in one more piece, then emerge on a ledge. Repeat. I did kind of a
hand jam with my left hand and just grabbed the edge of the crack with
my right. Very athletic and fun. The final move destroyed my composure
though: a strenuous lieback brought me to the top of the pillar with
no where else to move my hands up to. A bit flummoxed, I sort of
crashed onto the pillar-top on hands and knees. Theron videotaped my
rude mantelling gleefully (climbers don't like to use their knees -
bad style!).

Theron came up, falling once and generally finding it hard. Curiously,
the final move gave him no trouble. We probably have a different hip
to arm ratios or something wierd. Although my mouth filled with saliva
in that way it does when you are going to something scary and unknown,
I climbed up to a ledge and traversed right with the aid of a hand
crack. Reaching the base of the notorious offwidth crack, now snaking
above me for 50 feet, I laboriously hooked a bit of sling around a
stone lodged inside. After some more delaying tactics, like taking
pictures, I swung up into the crack, finding the occasional fist jam
where it tapered down. "This is doable," I thought, although not
feeling very keen to look down at the vast blue slabs and ice chunks
1000 feet below! I got higher and placed a #3 Camelot. A few moves
above I was in the widest part of the crack, and able to happily
unload the Old Maid 3.5 Cam. After a short rest and a glance around at
my forbidding surroundings I climbed up gradually easier ground to a
roof, then veered right on ledges and cracks to a great belay
ledge. It also looked like you could go straight up to the top of the
Gendarme.

Wow, that was a great pitch! Theron found it kind of unpleasant, often
ruminating that he really liked the lower part of the climb, saying a
lot by omission! But he took a great picture looking down between his
feet at the slabs below, and climbed up like a competent yeoman of the
mountains. We were happy that our packs weren't too heavy to require
hauling, which people seem to regard as hideous work on these pitches
(I'm not really sure why though?).

I led off again to gain the crest, making a creepy downclimb move to loose
blocks on the way to a belay below a steep wall. We knew there was a final short
pitch of 5.8-5.9 climbing here, so Theron sent me up a hand crack just right of
a flaring chimney. I placed protection often, wondering if the crux would catch
me unawares. But after a solid array of hand and foot jams, I emerged on top of
the step. From here, Theron took off on a long simul-climbing pitch of 4th and
low-5th class to the summit. It was very familiar, since we were there just two
months before. That didn't change the elation we felt at the views and
contemplation of what we had come up.

We hiked down to reach snow below the false summit, having a much
easier time than in May (falling through rotten snowfields into
holes). The snow didn't look fun to descend so Theron suggested
scrambling down rock to the lowest point. This worked well, then we
faced in and descended several hundred tedious feet of snow. Another
change in conditions since May: then we happily plunge-stepped down
this slope. An accident recently occurred here, I think someone
slipped and broke their ankle.

Now for the long walk down the Cascadian Couloir. I had never
descended the lower regions of this route, as Steve and I lost the
trail and headed into brush further to the east. I wryly reflected
that our brush descent of 1999 was probably easier than this "trail,"
which became especially ugly in a steep watercourse. Theron and I
sketched around on dirt slopes 100 feet above the stream, really
hating it. I guess we'd gotten off route, but a bunch of cairns led us
up there and dropped us off! It was such a bad feeling, being tired
from the climb, and descending far below your alpine camp into the
deep green valley. At the base of the "couloir," I was especially
exhausted. Theron was pugnacious, requiring me to take a picture that
captured his sense of helpless rage! Oh well, we signed up for it, so
now we hiked back up the valley towards Ingall's Lake. I was plaged by
memories of slogging up this in 1999, and made solemn promises to
descend the West Ridge or NW Buttress in the future. That said, the
Ingall's Creek trail is really pretty, ending in flat grassy meadows
(currently swarming with mosquitoes however).

We reached our camp near the lake after the sun went down but there
was still enough light to get around the lake without headlamps. I was
so tired, really wanting to sleep another night and hike out early in
the morning. But Theron would brook none of that, so we plodded away
for a long journey to the car that ended around midnight. I think we
got to bed around 3 am and had to get up for work early the next
morning. Ugh!

Looking back, I could see enjoying a bivy on this climb rather than
round-tripping from Ingall's Lake. Car to car in a day doesn't really
appeal to me, because there are so many miles that I think my feet
would really hurt even if I could move fast enough. Throwing a
sleeping bag and pad into the climbing pack wouldn't slow us down
much, because we had no problems climbing the Gendarme without hauling
as it was. Something to think about for next time (there sure will be
a next time for this awesome climb!).

It was another great time out with Theron. We have collected another
treasure chest of alpine memories, with the help of friendly weather
and a sleeping mountain!
