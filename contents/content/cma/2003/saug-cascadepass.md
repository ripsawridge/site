<h3>Cascade Pass, August 30, 2003</h3>

I took my sister Cathy up to see the beautiful views here.
Unfortunately, there was a fire on Johannesberg Mountain, and in the
parking lot we could barely see the cliffs and glaciers that make it so
dramatic there. The park rangers gave us a heather plant to carry up,
we were happy to do so. As we hiked the visibility improved, and by
the time we got up it was just a very hazy day. That was much better
than what we had below! Cathy lives in Oklahoma, and doesn't have any
mountains to hike up. So I was impressed with her pace and she seemed
to enjoy it too! We talked about squirrels, mountain climbing, roping
(her husband Joe is an experienced calf roper), and funny experiences
of our youth. One time, my mom tried to kill a rooster with an axe, but
apparently the axe bounced off his neck! Good times...Anyway, we lounged
on top of the pass for an hour, eating sandwiches. After seeing a marmot,
we headed down and drove for a milkshake at the Cascade Berry Farm.
Thanks for coming Cathy!
