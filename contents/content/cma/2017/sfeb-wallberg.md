### Wallberg
_February 14, 2017_

Hannes, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg tonight. Well, they managed to
keep skis on. Hannes used ski-crampons to deal with the really icy
slope and I don't know how Camillo managed! For me it was at least
700 meters of hiking up with skis on my back, and very uncomfortable
side-hilling on the ice in ski boots. Ugh! But I kept up with those
guys on skis and heck, it was good exercise.

This time we went to the true summit for a great starry view down
to Tegernsee. It was strangely warm. We skied down in surprisingly
good conditions. Only the steep/icy bit near the bottom gave me trouble.
I essentially skidded down most of it. Beer and schnitzel at the
Br√§uhaus after -- very nice!
