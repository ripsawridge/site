A nice hike from a parking lot a bit above Partschins. It was raining lightly
at the start, but amazingly, the day turned out fine.

I followed a trail not recorded in OpenStreetMap above the waterfall restaurant.

Beautiful, moody Texel Mountains.

Looking down-valley to Partschins.

In the high country, many nice goat then sheep. I crossed a few remnant
snowfields on the way to the hut, then enjoyed looking around and resting
there. It was still closed for winter. I'd sleep here many years ago
for a climb of Roteck and other peaks in the area.

On the way down, I impulsively decided to descend a *Klettersteig*. It's
called the **[Ziel Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/ziel-klettersteig-partschins-zieltal/)**. It was
quite interesting! Happily, no one was coming up so I didn't disturb anyone.
However, I had a little scare near when I realized I'd have to cross a river.
I held on to the steel cables on the swaying rope bridge and it was
alright.

I also surprised a sleeping baby goat, who was tucked away on the trail in
deep sleep. He didn't wake up until I got right next to him, lol.

I had a nice rest, dinner and a cigar at the Schutzh端tte Nasereit.

Great day, 1720 meters up and down.
