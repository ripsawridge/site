<h3>Index Climbing, July ??, 2003</h3>

Alex, Summer and I drove out for a few hours. I led the first pitch of
Princely Ambitions (5.9+), finding it much easier this time, but still a really
exciting and fun route. Then Summer led the second pitch, a really neat
5.8 hand crack that widened to a few chimney moves, then featured
stemming and more hand jams at the exit. We hiked an exposed ledge
over to Beak! Beak! Beak! (5.9), and Alex roped up for the lead.
His eye was drawn to the slabs to the right of the climb, so he
switched to that. I forgot the name, but it had nice slab climbing.
He moved back into Beak! Beak! Beak! and had a few enjoyable moves,
then finished in a ridiculously overgrown crack to a tree anchor.
Lowering off, he then belayed Summer on a top rope of that climb and
part of the slab on the right. Then I top-roped Beak! Beak! Beak!.
I really enjoyed the lower section. Nice jams allow you to place
some gear then lieback for a few moves. The upper part, with so much
vegetation is kind of funny: huge clump of dirt and moss followed by
an excavated handhold. Repeat 3x! We made two rappels, reaching the
ground at nightfall.
