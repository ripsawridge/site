Georg and I were hoping for some ice climbing, but the conditions just
continue to crumple our hopes!
  
  
Oh well, skiing it is then. We went to the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel, which
I'd skied the year before. Very nice tour, had a great time. We ran into
Adrian at the parking lot and the summit, he and a friend were zooming
up the mountain and getting some good exercise. Near the end we were passed
by these three relentlessly fast old guys, very humbling!
