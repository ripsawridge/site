### Snoqualmie Mountain, May 22, 2004
Needing some exercise but unable to get inspired by the health club, I
resigned myself to a rainy ascent of Snoqualmie Mountain. I walked
into the fog and clouds via the old trail near the Snow Lake
trailhead, taking a left turn 1000 feet up for Snoqualmie rather than
Guye. I was surprised to see a guy on his way down near here. The
clouds were thick but it wasn't raining, which was nice. About 400
feet below the summit, I met a party of two. We sat on rocks at the
summit and talked about climbs and hikes until it started snowing
hard. They went to climb Guye Peak, and I trundled my way down snow,
slick roots, rocks and trail.
