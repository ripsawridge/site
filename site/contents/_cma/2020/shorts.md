### Sulzberg

_April. 2020_

B. and Mara and I hiked up early in the morning. Was great! Trail running
lesson for B. on the way donw.

### Bischof

_April, 2020_

I hiked up Farchant and Bischof. Was great!

### Brünnstein

_April, 2020_

Hike up after work one day. 1150 meters up and down.

### Wank

Fun hike up the Wank, using a new south eastern approach (for me).
1100 meters up/down.

### Wildbarren again

_April 10, 2020_

This time up the steep hunter's trail, then down a kind of "normal way"
to the west. 1100 meters up/down.

### Wendelstein

_April, 2020_

Hiked up from the east by a small lake, gathering a sub-summit. Then down
via a northern valley route. 1650 meters up and down.

### Stepbergalm

_April 5, 2020_

Barbara and I hiked up to the Stepbergalm near the
Kramerspitze, an old favorite. About 1000 meters up/down.

### Wildbarren and Rehleitenkopf

_February 22, 2020_

Wonderful day up Wildbarren a new way, down to the south to the lake,
then over and across to the Rehleitenkopf in falling snow. Down
through a wonderful "klamm." Elevation gain/loss about 1700 meters.

### Wildbarren

_February 21, 2020_

Barbara and I on the Wildbarren for the first time. A wonderful day!
Two steep and interesting _Jägersteige_. 1100 meters up/down.

### Lampsenspitze

_February, 2020_

Barbara's first ski tour! We had a great time, though we stopped short of the
summit. She is skiing great in powder. Was really fantastic...

Snowshoe hike up the Ebnerjoch by myself. A good time! About 1000 meters up.

### Kranzhorn and Sulzberg

_February 1, 2020_

Great hike, no need for snowshoes. I took my "direct route" up at the
level-off point, this time climbing to the summit above the chapel.
The inside of the chapel was beautiful. I really liked the image of
Jesus as a child, with the cross behind him and a shining light.
The image reminded me of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, with Joseph
and Mary serving as the pillars of Severity and Mercy, with the
Christ child in approximately the right position for the sphere
Tiphareth, where, in fact, he "belongs" as intermediary between
humanity and the Godhead. Anyhows, go up and see 'ems for yourself. :)

I had this thought:

> Note the childs joy. And it is the Cross behind which will break
> him. And yet, remains the Source of his Light. May we all find
> our Cross, and meet it with Joy.

Okay! Next hike! I wanted about another 600 meters or so, and found it
in a charming mountain called Sulzberg. Really neat steep trail up
the east side of the peak. Up and down before the evening began.

~1500 meters up and down with the two peaks.

### Wallberg

_January 12, 2020_

A nice hike up. I felt very, very happy. I shaved my head, too. Heh!
