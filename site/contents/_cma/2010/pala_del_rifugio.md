We decided to head down to the Pala Dolomites. We had time because Tuesday
was predicted to be bad weather everywhere. Actually it wasn't bad until
evening, then there was a massive thunderstorm like we'd never seen. The
rain started as we made the short hike from the car to the Rifugio Treviso,
which is right at the base of the climb. It didn't let up for hours, and
eventually tiny harmless streams on the mountainside turned into frightening
torrents with rolling boulders. Later, we met an American couple who were
stranded by one of these torrents (certain death to try and cross), and
forced to reclimb to a bivouac box 2000 feet above! I'd never seen anything
like it.

Our plan was to climb this route then continue along the West Ridge of
Sasso d'Ortiga for a really grand day. But several things happened to derail
that. First, the hut warden may have been concerned about too many parties
trying to do the same route. He suggested we climb to the summit of Pala
del Rifugio via another route, a bit shorter but harder. He also pooh-poohed
our request to get up really early, saying that the normal breakfast time
should be good enough. Perhaps feeling like we were behaving over-cautiously
we agreed to these changes.
  
  
We set off in the morning with others, noting that vegetation and rock
were still soaked from the night before. After a tough 45 minutes we stood
below the alternate route, not liking our chances at all. Above was a black,
dripping chimney, supposedly the crux of the route at grade V+. Now I've
been in grade IV chimneys that scared me to death when soaked, and I lost
my desire to do battle with this thing very quickly. Jesse felt likewise.
I was upset that our "monster" day might be taken from us due to bad advice
(that I truly felt like ignoring before anyway, but didn't say anything).
The weather was beautiful...should we wait for the rock to dry? Should
we ignore the lower 16 pitches in favor of just doing the upper 9? I wanted
to do neither, and immediately set off to speed down and get on our original
route in hopes of salvaging the day.
  
  
We did this, but I'd become kind of sour and uncommunicative as I mulled
over all these factors. Jesse wanted to stop and talk it over a few minutes
but I wasn't hearing him. I'd gotten the idea that it was "my job" to "save
the day," and didn't see the use. My foolishness on this point cast a pall
over the first hours of our climbing, and it was only after a long discussion
later that we could finally understand each other. I was abashed at having
been disrespectful, and admired Jesse's forbearance and patience with me.
I'm always nervous until we are properly on the climb (my other friends
can attest to this too!), and really have to learn to take early setbacks
in stride. The day is long...the chances for success are many...
  
  
So anyway, we eventually made it to the other side of the mountain and
the Northwest Ridge. An Austrian (Styrian) party of four was getting ready
to climb. Along with them, we scrambled the first two easy pitches, made
a little sketchy due to wet grass and rocks. They were very kind and offered
for us to go first. Two or three pitches of mediocre climbing led to a
ledge right of the ridge and an obvious chimney that must be one of the
grade V cruxes. I led this, very happy that it was dry! Another long pitch
with some simul-climbing, slightly easier, got to the First Shoulder.

Spirits lifting a bit, we simul-climbed easy terrain up to where the buttress
steepened again. Here, I made a route-finding error that had us climbing
a rather unpleasant variation for a few pitches. My topo said "climb gully
left of the arete" and showed a broad, deep "gully," that could only be
the enormous gully right above us. I saw a face climb that could (if you
squint just right) be characterized as a very shallow gully. It looked
better. I should have taken it. But I was a slave to (a poor interpretation
of) the topo!
  
  
So I led us into the dark gully, eventually a dark, dripping gully. While
the Styrians watched far below, telegraphing their opinion of my route
choice, I stemmed up to the crux: an 10-inch slot with smooth walls. In
a moment of unexpected (later) hilarity, Jesse was making small talk and
I blurted out "CANTTALKRIGHTNOW!" surprising myself at the ragged edge
of fear in my voice. I had one foot pasted on a sloping wall and was pawing
unsuccessfully for anything positive above the slot that awkwardly held
part of my body. I was too far above protection to prevent crashing onto
a ledge. Slow down and breathe. Eventually, micromovements that brought
my foot a couple of inches higher got me something I could use. I built
a gear belay and breathed the tension out, straining to see what we had
above us. Would overhangs choke us off?

Jesse came up and wished me luck. Happily, fears were overblown and we
entered a realm of quality climbing again. After traversing a short vertical
wall the sight of a piton cheered me up. A fun face climb with another
piton allowed me to climb out of our "massive gully" and join the regular
route. Jesse came up and we looked sadly down what appeared to be nice
climbing to the right of our gully. We don't recommend our three pitch
"adventure variant!"
  
  
Soon we stood on the Second Shoulder, and it's only here, for the last
4-5 pitches of the route that it becomes a wonderful Dolomiti climb. Swapping
leads, we enjoyed steep terrain marked by enormous holds and lots of incredible,
bomber natural protection (natural columns in the rock called Sanduhr,
which you can wrap a sling securely around).

These pitches were amazing and we could smile now after all the hemming
and hawing and difficulties below. On the summit we had an amazing vision
of the Sasso d'Ortiga behind us, looming like a smooth South American buttress.
I quite wanted to continue, but eventually it became clear that we'd miss
dinner and stumble back pretty late. Now...I wish we had just done it...but
at the time the thought of dinner did have a strong hold on us!

We descended carefully, having to negotiate some extremely exposed 4th
and low 5th class in tennis shoes. We would think "man, this is a tough
traverse!" and suddenly see a piton in front of our faces. "I guess people
belay this?" But with care, we made it through to the notch where the Sasso
d'Ortiga route begins. Firmly in descent mode, we bade it a reluctant farewell.
  
  
On the way down we talked with another party who had done the climb we
gave up on. Indeed, it had been tough in the lower part. We continued down
to a good dinner and a reunion with the Styrian party. They had been very
reticent, looking at us funny when we'd say something (like "hello"). But
now they were different. Jesse described how we won them over in such a
hilarious way: just relentless cheerfulness from both of us. Ignoring the
cold or blank stares...offering advice about where to belay, etc. By the
end, they were smiling too!

So this climb has some minor flaws. But I think it was good for us to
have some friction with each other because it was an opportunity to see
how we deal with conflict. We want to do bigger climbs together in the
future, and having seen each other in a bad mood is already helpful for
that (well...Jesse saw ME in a bad mood. I don't think he's ever been in
a bad mood...that's a compliment people sometimes give me...but I've met
my master in that regard!).
