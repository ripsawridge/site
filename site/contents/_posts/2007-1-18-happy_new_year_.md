Hi everybean. Lots of things I want to do on this creaky old site. For
one thing, post more in general (duh). For another, archive my climbing
site in a nice way and just write trip reports in here. Write up interesting
things related to work, Java, etc.
  
  
Kris and the boys just got home, it's so great to have them back. I swear
the boys grew since I saw them 3 weeks before! Kris is a zombie with Jetlag
but the kids are fine. We had a great time playing tonight. I ordered pizza
for dinner. (weak cheering).

I was in a ski class from Saturday morning to Tuesday night. It was very
good, but humbling too. I was basically the worst student. I fell so often
and wore myself out so much that I had to sit out a day (Monday). It seemed
like I got whiplash, and then the glands in my throat became tender. "Yer
a tough bastard!" said my teacher up until I played hooky. Oh well, Rome
wasn't built in a day.
  
  
But it was bad to see that my Dad had to be flown to the hospital in Houston
when an artery in his tongue ruptured. It seems that the tumor in his throat
was actually growing, and it kind of took over this artery. He is stable
now, and coming home Saturday. I just talked to Mom and found out that
his tongue is still okay, so he can still talk normally. Yay! Tom, keep
fighting, we love you! It must have been really scary for Mom to get him
to the hospital, helicopter, etc.
