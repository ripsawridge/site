I'd met Michael back in August [on the Zsigmondyspitze climb](zsigmondy.html). He zoomed
up behind and passed me after a short conversation, then we met again
right below the last pitch to the summit. I thought it was funny how we
sat down on a sloping ledge and had a great chat and some laughs, while
folks moved busily up and down the route with ropes off to the side.
This would be our first chance to do a climb together, and we decided on
the Rigelekante on the Hochgrubachspitze, since the snows of late
September had finally melted and we should have a whole day of sun. So
something high but also south-facing owing to the late season seemed
like just the thing.

We started really early and walked up under a sliver of moonlight with the
occasional aid of his headlamp (I'd misplaced mine somehow). Talking of
many things, we climbed up and east from the Wochenbrunneralm parking lot.
As we came beneath our peaks, the sun rose. It would be a great, silent
gentle giant observing our progress, and we'd see it arc across the
southern sky. We were both really pleased to discover that we follow the
same rather mystical ideas about the nature and ends of the world, and of our
roles in it. Nothing open ended is boring. Each subject offers a thread
to be followed like an incipient stream coming down from high mountains,
and which we, like miners looking for traces of gold, can follow upstream.

And we can laugh the whole time! This is as it should be, hmpf!

Glad to be able to see the whole mountain above us, we followed faint and
often-disappearing traces of trail in the vast scree field that guards
the approach. Once on the steep hummocks of grass and rocky slopes, we only
had to travel a few more minutes to our cutoff point, where we left a
backpack. Michael knew a better approach to the base of the route than
I had [used before with Vaclav](../2018/riegele.html). Back in 2018, Vaclav and I had traversed
to the right a long ways before turning up in gullies. This time, we moved
diagonally up to the base of the impressive south face of the western
summit, then easily rounded a corner to the final gully below our route.
This way was definitely faster and easier! Granted, Vaclav and I had
blowing clouds and mist around us, and I should be thankful that we found
it at all!

I took the first pitch, making a slight error in going too far right, and
having to execute some interesting traversing moves around a pillar of
rock to gain the main line at a notch with a bolt. I also placed a couple
of cams on the route.

Michael took the second pitch, which is really nice! Up and left to a
crack, then to a notch and a vertical corner crack gradually leading to
easier ground. I think the pitch was entirely gear, maybe one piton along
the way.

We continued like this and Michael filled me in on an adventure he'd had
on the route a few years before. He'd climbed it with a friend in
snowy conditions, wearing mountain boots. Several sections that were easy
for us today had been rather nightmarish with fresh snow on level
steps on the ridge. "In the upper section, we saw the lights come on
in the valleys...and then...we saw the lights turn out." At one point
they spent nearly an hour chopping steps out of an icy depression blocking
access to the west summit.

Whoa. Climbing can really seem like interplanetary exploration sometimes.
Civilization is quite near, but also a million miles away at times like that!

Pitch 5 was interesting because of some confusion with the topo. It said
to stay right of the crest on grade III terrain. However, I was right on
the crest, and the only possibility was to go left of the crest, and even
that didn't look easy. I asked Michael to keep an eye on me, because I
was going into uncharted terrain (at least, from my point of view). I
traversed left on a face from a secure buttress on the crest, then worked
my way back right on shallow cracks. Then I was rewarded with a fixed
piton that hopefully meant I was back on the route. Nice! Then there
was a fun but somewhat shallow crack to climb, which I could protect
well with cams.

Soon we reached the crux pitch. It was about 5 steep meters to reach the
first of three bolts, and not easy meters! I was able to slot a nut in
a shallow seam, then move delicately up to a ledge. Of course I had to
take a picture here, it looked really neat down to the belay stance on
the crest.

Then I moved up the crack on a mix of good and rather odd holds with
somewhat slippery feet. Above another bolt I was wondering whether to
go right or left, and saw the last bolt up to the right (actually, this
was a piton now that I think about it). I was able to clip it from an
odd position -- I probably should have waited a bit. Then I went left on
good side-pulls outside of the crack, and finally back right to a ledge.
Nice! A few more meters and I reached the belay.

It was great fun to stand in the sun and admire the steep wall, trying to
get a few good pictures of Michael as he climbed. Unfortunately, the
near-vertical wall tended to flatten out in the photos, and they don't
convey the verticality of the position. The climber appears to be
lazily rolling up a sloping ledge, but in reality he is on the tips of
his toes, and grip strength on slippery holds is rapidly fading!

We should hire a photographer to be off to the side for such things...!

We shortened the rope and moved up to the final pitch, which Michael dispatched
via a ramp going off to the left. I came up and we scrambled over to the
summit, happily changing into shoes. Ahh...that feels good.

People were walking the final meters to the western summit, and they looked
quite heroic in the late afternoon light. We scrambled down the ridge,
happily conversing about the life of Mahatma K. Gandhi. I was reading about
his life, taking a keen interest in his struggles with *bramacharya*. This
tradition lives on in the west in very faint form in the too-easily-derided
idea that sex is for procreation, and not meant to be elevated to the
level of "identity." Michael laughed, saying that if anybody came along and
heard our esoteric discussions, he wouldn't believe his ears!

It was also interesting that on the day we met, Michael had a conversation
with the older fellow we both passed on the approach, and this man
referred to the very book (Gandhi's autobiography) that I was reading,
even pointing to it in the top of his backpack. And now here I am, going
on and on about the details of the book.

In fact, we counted many strange correspondences and coincidences which
surrounded our meeting. It is something to be thankful for, along with the
simple thanks to God for safe passage on this interesting rock climb!

*Here we are discussing numerology, and how astrological ideas are
based on regular cycles in the human psyche, influenced by what appear
to be physical objects (for example, the moon), but which have a subtle
inner life of their own which meets and affects our own*

We met the party we'd seen before on the west summit, and hung out there
a while. Michael shared a small bottle of ginger and other spices, which was
a real pick-me-up! The way down seemed to go on forever, and by the time
we reached our backpack, the sky was decidedly orange, as it had been
when we last saw it. The days grow short indeed...

{% image /cmaimages/2024/IMG_2411.jpg %}
*Irrational exuberance!*

A bit of scree-skiing caused Michael's shoes to finally declare themselves
dead, but they'd have to hold together for the rest of the way down.
In the valley above the Wochenbrunner Alm, I finally needed some light, so
he held his phone lamp up. On the road, we met two other climbers who had
climbed the Schüle-Diem route on the Predigtstuhl. We were all happy with
the weather, especially since there was no wind on this day.

Back at Michael's place, he made us a dinner with freshly foraged mushrooms
from the forest around Bad Feilnbach. Awesome! What a great day. 8 pitches,
around 1400 meters up and down. Many thanks to Michael for the company!
