*I took this picture in the summer, above the Achensee. I love the way the panoramic
wide-angle seems to cradle the valley below. Life is like this. Your view on
the world "cradles" it. Your view is unique, and adds real love to existence
thanks to the particularity of that view. Love needs something particular to
flower. It's famously easy to make loving expressions in the abstract.
But those expressions have no real power. That which you gaze upon must have
its flaws...they serve as hooks which rescue you by awakening your compassion.*

Note: *I wrote this last April, but it's stuck with me. I feel I should share what I am
a little bit more. Not that anyone is listening out there. It's more about
my attitude. Am I so special that I have to clutch my thoughts to my bosum?
No. They are just thoughts. I like them, mostly. I'll stick 'em here.*

This morning in meditation I imagined my ego as a little park ranger in a
beautiful park.

He’s always trying to make some perfect situations for the park guests, but he
doesn’t realize that it’s better to do nothing at all. The guests are here to
enjoy the nature of the park. He busily creates a little “play area,” he
invents games with sticks and cards. Then he’s upset when the guests wander
away, uninterested in these games. That dude is who I have been. Or maybe I
should say it like this:

> that ranger is the unelected governor of me. I am the
> park, and I might need a ranger, but he should sit in my nature and love it for
> what it is.

For I, the nature, am sitting in my Father’s nature[^1], and loving what it is. And
He is doing the same. In *right relation* we all look with love to our Source.

The park ranger has his source in me. Born out of me and empowered by me. But I
didn’t know how to provide for him. So he did his best. And he looked at me,
seeing my uncertainty. “Nature can’t take care of herself,” he thought, and
began to rummage in his tools. Doing his best in a godless world.

I must relieve him of duty. Though...I allow him to live in the ranger’s hut
forever. He will have free time, and he will feel lost. This is necessary --
necessary that he re-orient around faith that his natural world knows best but
does not say in words. That
he find in Her[^2] what he tried to build alone. He will walk amid his failed
works, and know them for the sad things they are: artifacts of a loveless
existence. And as sadness fills him, and yet he *does not collapse into
plan-making*[^3], then I can love him.

I can reach him.

And when he feels this, he will hold himself, too. And then we are in right
relation with each other.

And then words have served their purpose.

[^1]:
    The "old-fashioned" and gendered syntax here might be off-putting to us
    modern folks. I can imagine reading this myself, and thinking "gee, why does
    this dude have to limit the appeal of his message by talking about *God* for
    one thing, and even worse, talking about God as a *he*? 'My father's nature,'
    is that really necessary?" Since I left it in, I think it is. I'm using my
    nose, or some similar *other* sense to feel my way into the right frame of
    consciousness. And "my father's" is the phrase that fits. Only it conveys
    the sense of a giving up of myself into the hands of one who knows more and
    will treat me with compassion. It's tied to the word or the feeling of
    surrender. If I said mother, it would somehow mean retreat into what-was-known
    for me. If I say father, it means something more like...falling forward into
    unknown and unexpected grace. All creation is cycles. I think there is a cycle
    in me of movement from mother to father, and thence back to mother in another
    way. I don't know...I'm just putting this footnote here to let you know that
    at least sometimes, I see that my words are jarring and out of tune. I do
    worry about this. But it's better I think to show who and where I am, with
    whatever flaws are present. Only then do I have a chance to understand things
    myself.

[^2]:
    "WTF, dude?" I can hear the reader exclaim. Now gendered language again, but in
    the other direction? And you said that *you* were Nature, and now, this Nature is
    a her and not a him? Why bother? You are either confusing or offensive -- maybe
    both at the same time.
     
    We contain multitudes. I have masculine in me. I have feminine in me. When I walk
    through the forest, I feel a presence. It is timeless and enormous. But also
    loving of the small particulars that it sees. I am one of those particulars...small,
    and yet warm through the awareness that I am beloved. When I feel the Awareness in
    this way, it has a feminine quality. I catch a hint of beautiful scent. A whimsical
    absence in the place that I look...and a presence that wraps a cloak around my
    shoulders when I give up looking. The hands and fingers that bring this cloak are
    fine and sensitive, suggesting features built on a fine scale.
     
    Maybe not in the extreme presentations of nature, but definitely in the normal
    presentation, there is femininity. I am gifted by this. If it can have a life *in*
    me as well, then I am gifted again. So...the park ranger in me walks in my
    loving femininity, and looks to her for solace. She is there. I am here, and there,
    and nowhere.
     
    This is the best explanation I can give!

[^3]:
    What felt fresh and exciting to me here was the idea that communication between Spirit
    and Mind only occurs when Mind stops spinning. Normally, Mind falls into itself, thinking
    itself alone. It makes plans to fix what is broken. This goes on for decades. Finally
    though...maybe Mind is just tired. Maybe it begins to dawn that this activity is just
    circular. It goes quiet.

    Here, in my thinking, is the moment that finally, Spirit utters a single word that is heard.
    In fact, the word will not be heard...only the reverberation of it in the great cave of
    consciousness. The system is held fast by the breathtaking beauty of the reverberation and
    echo of that soundless word...filtering through all the fibers of being. Ah ha...
     
    Now communication has begun. At long last.
