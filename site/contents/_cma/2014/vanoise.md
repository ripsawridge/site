Lac de Plan d'Amont


I was tired of waiting around for good weather to climb, and was ready to
surrender to the weather gods. I give up! My joy won't be held hostage anymore
by reports of precipitation. I drove to Aussois, purchased a small backpack and
bought some snacks. I bought a map and read over my options. It looked like I
could do a loop hike from here up north to the Col de la Vanoise, and then back,
clockwise. Right on, I thought.

I stuffed my tiny backpack and headed up in a mix of clouds and sun, first going
through a ski area, then to the lake of Plan d'Amont. I hiked further,
eventually leaving a road to head straight up grass slopes to the top of the ski
area. From here I hiked to the Refuge de la Dent Parach√©e, technically a bit out
of my way but I had plenty of time. The country was beautiful. At the refuge I
sat for a while and thought about ordering a drink. But the skies looked murky
so I pressed on, going across a balcony then downhill. I left my umbrella at a
rock and had to backtrack a few minutes to get it. But soon enough I was down at
my home for the night, the Refuge du Fond l'Aussois. It was getting downright
cold!

I went in, ordered a glass of wine, read my book and just enjoyed the warm
common room. After a short rest, I came back for dinner. Something great about
the French huts is that they usually serve wine with dinner, and it comes in the
price. I talked with some folks, including a nice fella from Germany, a teacher
who was doing almost the same hike but counter-clockwise. I went to sleep
peacefully, knowing that the weather forecast wasn't great but that all I had to
do was walk. I didn't need dry rock slabs to make me happy.

From the Pointe de l'Observatoire



In the morning I continued up valley making for the Col d'Aussois. The weather
was surprisingly good. I was also packing a trail lunch I'd purchased from the
hut. At the col I detoured to hike up the Pointe de l'Observatoire, a nice rocky
scramble. I was in a hurry because the clouds were quickly lowering and the wind
was starting to scream. In the last minutes below the summit snowflakes started
to fall. "Hurry!" I said, wanting to get a picture of the area and a view of the
way ahead. I was just barely successful!

Hiking down in light rain I entered a green valley and saw a few people, my
first of the day. I was listening to "the Art of Communicating" by Thich Nhat
Hanh. It's a fascinating book. I like this simple Buddhist idea of thinking of
effective communication as that communication which relieves suffering. Lost in
my own world, I rounded corners, went up and down and before I knew it the sun
was back out and I was near Chalet des Nants, an incredible meadow with a
hanging glacier above, ice chunks draped over black cliffs looking ready to
crash down.

I ate lunch on a rock here, really impressed with the "French" nature of the
pack lunch. There was bread, meat, cheese, a tin of corn and other
vegetables. There were cookies, and a container of applesauce. Wow! This was a
real treat!

I hiked uphill to the Refuge de la Vallette. In here, I was thinking about my
boys and how their destiny might run in life. I saw them diverging and then
coming back together in a synergistic way. Somehow this kind of walking was
proving to be medicine to me. I've tried to convey it to friends, but it's so
intensely personal, I guess.

Looking across the valley



It was only about 2:30, and I didn't want to go to the hut, knowing from
experience that once you go in and take off your shoes you don't come out again!

I hiked up a broad flat-topped summit near the huts with excellent views up and
down valley. I could see the Valley de la Gliere, my destination for the next
day. I was already realizing I could do more hiking per day than my "reasonable"
itinerary showed. I made plans for a "monster" day, because the weather would be
good again and I didn't want to miss out.

I descended to the hut as the rain and wind started. Within the hour, it would
begin to snow. The Refuge de la Valette was very cozy. Everyone gathered in the
common room, and we put wet socks and garments as close to the wood stove as
possible. I drank some coffee, then wine. Dinner was delicious. Stepping out
into the falling snow to get to the bunkhouse was bracing!

With disturbing self-reflexivity



In the morning, the ground was white with snow and frost. But no matter, the sun
was already out. I traversed mountainsides to get a view of the town Pralognan
la Vanoise below, with morning clouds being scraped away by the sun. I passed
through the Col du Grand Marchet then crossed a waterfall on treacherous frozen
rocks while Ibex stared at me impassively.

Eventually I stopped for a snack in the Valley de la Gliere, to dry my feet and
socks on warm rock. After 3.5 hours of hiking, I was at the Refuge du Col de la
Vanoise, and it would have been crazy to stop here for the night. I would fit in
another "day" today.

I passed a beautiful lake and was in awe of exciting new views to the North and
East now that the bulk of glaciers had been bypassed. Here the scenery was
really amazing, probably my favorite. I traversed a series of broad valleys with
granite peaks and amazing blue lakes. I saw more Ibex and Chamois were
everywhere. I loved this constant walking! Finally, in early evening I reached
the Refuge de l'Arpont. It was a sleek, modern building, only the bunkhouse
retained the traditional look. Happily, I met my German friend again here. We
had a great long conversation about the world, politics, the environment.

A packed lunch



In the morning I set off to the south, again with a packed lunch from the
hut. Beautiful balcony trails followed, with only occasional ups and
downs. There were quite a few old collapsed farms in this section. I talked with
a French woman on the trail who I'd seen yesterday as well. She had a very heavy
pack but was small and tough. I thought about her for quite a while
after. Solitude has a way of spreading out small interactions, so that each word
and turn in the conversation is later examined and drawn out in the mind. I
imagine on the great lonely frontiers of 19th century America a settler would
learn so much from the interaction of just a few words with another. Once you
are used to that style, it seems clear that the information overload of a city
would be experienced as horror.

Paragliders, that signifier of good weather, were everywhere. It did remain
quite cold though, despite the yellow sun. But these days of good weather made
me feel good about trying to climb again. I enjoyed my lunch by an abandoned
farm, again impressed with the whimsical variety of the contents (the
cheese was *especially* good), then finished
the hike down to Aussois, at one point helping a lady who was descending a ski
slope on her butt. She had weak knees and this was the safest way. I offered an
arm and we went together this way - hopefully I wasn't annoying!

Back in town I had an amazing tagliatelle lunch with beer at an outdoor table by
a fountain. I was really in the lap of luxury, no matter how much hiking I
crammed into a day!

I drove down valley to an anonymous camping site, contacted Georg for a plan to
meet up the next day, enjoyed a pizza dinner and slept outside by the car.

Georg and I would drive a lot and try mightily to climb, but the weather just
wouldn't allow it. The hiking life was the better one, at least this year.
