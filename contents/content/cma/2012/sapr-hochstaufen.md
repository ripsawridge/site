Hiked up Hochstaufen, mainly because I'd hardly done any hikes over the
Salzburg area and was looking for something new. Foolishly, I wore tennis shoes
and didn't bring an ice axe. The "Jaeger Steig" trail I used to reach the
summit featured many, many snowy traverses on the south face of the mountain.
On the summit I wrung cups of water out of my socks. It would have been a lot
better to have proper boots. But the weather was nice and the views were great.
I took an easier trail down, but still dealt with long snow traverses.
Eventually I did some boot glissading and sitting glissades to lose lots of
elevation.
