Somehow I forgot to write this up, and remembered it in 2021.
Anyway, on this tour I met my buddy Jong for the first time. He and I were both climbing
this Königsjodler *Klettersteig* alone. I caught up to him at some point, and we were
moving at similar paces and styles, so we just stuck together and climbed up the
metal cables, laughing and talking all the while.

I quite enjoyed the "flying fox." On the summit, we got some beer and Apfelstruedel
in the house. Boy, pre-Corona times! I don't remember what it's even like to go into
a hut, it's been well over a year now.

Anyway, we went down a steep trail just on the side of the amazing Königsjodler ridge
called the Birgkarsteig. We promised to meet up again, and sure enough we ran
into each other at the local climbing gym by accident, then did some great hikes.

Here are climbers on the tortured ridge:
