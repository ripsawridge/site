night I burned the midnight oil to finish a code project I've been working
on since Christmas. It's a bulk uploader for [Summitpost.org](http://www.summitpost.org/),
a beloved site for many mountain climbers and hikers around the globe.
Despite a snazzy "Web 2.0" interface, there is still no possibility to
bulk upload pictures. Therefore, creating a content page on your favorite
mountain or climbing route can become an exercise in manual drudgery once
you upload more than 10 pictures or so.
  
  
First I wrote the tool on the Mac in Python with wxWidgets for the GUI.
But deployment was a real pain, and I didn't feel I had sufficient control
over the UI. So I re-wrote it in C++, also with wxWidgets. Right now I
have a Windows version, but it shouldn't be too hard to port it to the
Mac in the future.

There is a [discussion page](http://www.summitpost.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=43402) over
at Summitpost already getting some interesting responses.
  
  
It's been a fun hobby project. Especially because I believe a lot of people
will want to use it. That is very motivating!
