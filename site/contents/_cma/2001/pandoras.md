Steve, Chris and I hiked up to Colchuck Lake, thinking to climb the North
Buttress Colouir route on Colchuck Peak. But Steve's ankle was injured, and he
turned back. Chris and I kept going, but gave up on the route due to the great
heat and sugary snow. We continued up the glacier and climbed Pandora's Box. We
would have continued on to Dragontail's summit, but we ran out of time. Mostly
because I'm a slowpoke!

This is the North Buttress Colouir. It faces east, and receives sun very early. Best to start climbing it before dawn this late in the season, perhaps.

Clowning around on the Colchuck Glacier. Wow...sure is steep!

Argonaut Peak looks like a great mountain climb.
