### Gro√üer Bettelwurf

I hiked up from Hall, following the *klettersteig* on the west ridge to the
summit, then coming down the (normal) south ridge. What a beautiful and high
mountain. Incredible views directly down to the
north! About 2000 meters up and down.

### Wiedersberger Horn and friends

First up Hamberg (2096 m) from parking on a road below the Bachleralm (1674 m),
then along the ridge to the Standkopf (2241 m). From there north to Hochstand
(2058 m) and the Wiedersberger Horn (2127 m).

Then down through forest, road, and steep meadow back to the car. About 1400
meters up/down, and 16 kilometers.

Pictures from the two days:
