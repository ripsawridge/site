* Kleine Zinne, "Yellow Edge" (VI+, 14 pitches)

We slept in the Trevisio Hut and hiked down in the morning. Suddenly it
was Thursday. We were running out of time! We wanted to do something "big,"
and finally a more stable weather pattern was supposed to arrive, or already
be here. We thought about a variety of objectives, but finally settled
on the Grosse Zinne (Cima Grande), via the Comici North Face. Friday would
be the best weather forecast so far. We drove north, having lunch along
the way somewhere. At Lake Misurina I grew so tired of driving (or being
in the car) that I had to get out and read a few hours. I'd passed up an
opportunity for gas in Cortina, and now realized I really needed it. We
had to drive up to Dobbiaco for a station, some water and another forecast
check. Eventually we were settled in the Rifugio Aronzo, all set to wake
up early and climb.

In the morning everything went smoothly. We made the approach, and in
the last few minutes two parties came running up behind us. One of them
did another climb, but the other was pleased to set his foot at the base
of the route a few seconds before me, feeling that he'd "claimed his place."
Looking up, we saw the route was already crowded. This kind of sucked.
Rather mad, I soloed the first pitch (easy, loose terrain) and brought
Jesse up, ignoring this smug running fellow (turns out he's the "lead guide,"
Jesse saw his picture in the Aronzo hut). Later the running man threaded
his rope through another party on the second pitch, pulling on their rope
and tugging on the protection! (it was a nut that could easily fall out
with such activity).

Jesse and I sat at our place in line at the top of the first pitch, realizing
it would be at least 2 hours before we could move. Starting at pitch 3,
the route is grade VII- for many pitches. So it's a very slow single file
affair. There were even people hidden on a ledge above that we hadn't seen.
And we were the last in line. We waited about 45 minutes, then climbed
down, unwilling to sit there the whole morning.
  
  
Somewhat disgusted with the whole situation, and maybe ourselves for not
having foreseen this particular difficulty, we stomped away and formed
a new plan. I'd run back to the car and get the topo for "The Yellow Edge,"
then we'd climb that. I slipped twice on steep scree and cut my wrist enough
to cover my hand and helmet in blood. An alarmed Jesse gave me some tape
to wrap it up. No way I'm not climbing cuza that!
  
  
A strange fog rolled in, making my jog to the car and back monotonous.
We humped up to the base of the route, really happy to see that there was
only one party 3 pitches above.

Jesse got the first pitch (30 m), rather intimidating for it's V+ or VI-
grade because the holds are small and polished. I continued for pitch 2,
a VI or VI- crack with a brief but exciting overhanging section. The main
problem there was feeling like your feet might blast off of a polished
slope like ice. I felt every microscopic movement and torqued hard on the
jams. Happily, polish doesn't disturb a good hand jam too much.

We were happy to be done with those pitches, often described as the real
crux despite some VI+ moves higher up that are without polish. Now we followed
four long pitches right of the crest, mostly on easy terrain with several
lines available. We slavishly followed our topo, not wanting to miss the
spot where we make a hard left traverse to reach the edge (doesn't make
sense to call it a ridge...it's totally vertical the whole way). This short
traverse was easy but thrillingly exposed. I led a very enjoyable face
climb (V+) past some pitons right on the edge to a nice stance below the
crux pitch.

I moved the belay from the one suggested on the topo so I could watch
Jesse climb the pitch. He did a great job, passing a lower VI- section
that had a short vertical wall but good hands in a crack. Then the real
meat of the pitch came, in an overhanging yellow corner with good handholds
but outrageous exposure (VI+). He beefed up the 3-piton belay with a cam
and a sling, understandably nervous hanging way out in space, nothing but
air around, and people with binoculars watching him from the Lavaredo Hut.
This was a joyous pitch to climb. It felt very well protected (if you trust
pitons :)), and the moves were athletic but secure. Between this and the
next pitch, another thrilling traverse followed by 20 meters of steep face
climbing (V+), this route became elevated to something mythic. Two more
pitches of incredibly exposed face climbing had us laughing and continuously
amazed at the greatness of this climb.

A final "ordinary" pitch, because it was somewhat sheltered from the exposure
we'd grown to love, and then we stood at the top of the "edge." I was so
impressed with the climb, I didn't even think about going on to the true
summit of the Kleine Zinne (not hard), only now I wish I had. But if there
is one climb to repeat in a lifetime, it's this one, for sure.
  
  
We scrambled ledges to a point above the notch between the Kleine and
Grosse Zinne. We made two double rope rappels then several single rope
rappels to reach the notch, then descended unpleasant hard, dirty snow
for quite a while. Eventually, very muddy and with frozen fingers (and
me with some blood from my wound), we escaped the gully and retrieved our
pack at the base of the climb.
  
  
We'd salvaged the day really well. Holy cow, that was fun!

Funny story with the photo above. We'd dropped this carabiner on pitch
10, and found it laying on the trail right below the wall. Woo hoo! Aluminum
doesn't have a hairline crack problem, so we think it's okay to use again.

Goodbye Yellow Edge. I think I'll climb you again in this life!
