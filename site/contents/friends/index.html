<h1>My friends</h1>

<p>
I've tagged my reports with friends and family that come along.
With this feature, I've been able to create a custom URL for each
person I climbed with, this way they can see the reports that
contain them. I hope to enhance that with statistics, though, I
guess, this is not that useful if you do things with people other
than myself! But I'm thinking here of my girlfriend, for whom it
will be a pretty complete record of her work in the hills. And
that sounds fun to me.
