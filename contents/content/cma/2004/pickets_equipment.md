The Equipment

Just for future reference, I thought I'd record what I brought along on
the trip, and what our "group gear" was. Note that band-aids and duct tape
only became group gear because I forgot to bring some, so we went through
Theron and Aidan's supply of those items pretty quick! In the picture you see
our Betamid tent, purchased a few days before the trip at [Pro
Mountain Sports](https://promountainsports.com/). 
You can see my hiking poles holding it up (cheap REI
poles, I go through two sets a year). Also two Black Diamond Ice Packs are
visible, belonging to myself and Aidan.

We were really happy with our equipment. The only complaints were that we needed
more duct tape, Aidan's full-shank boots were too heavy, and we kept losing
water bags (by the end only I had one functioning water bag!). On a good
note it's amazing how long a small GigaPower fuel canister will last if you
just use it to bring water to a boil once per day. Even with an extended
snow-melting session on the summit of Mt. Fury, we barely broke into our
second fuel canister. Our dehydrated meals were especially good.
