### Silver Peak Skiing, 12/30/1999

I skied up FS Road 9070, reaching Nordic Pass around 10:30 am. 
At the pass, the fog cleared, and I had great views of peaks such as 
Chair, the Tooth, Snoqualmie, Catherine and Silver. I skied up the 
clearcuts of Ollie Meadows, then two Channel 4 helicopters buzzed 60 
feet over my head. They hovered in the area for a while, then continued 
over the pass to the north. Would I be on the news? Finally, I 
abandoned the skis and climbed to about 5000 feet on a west shoulder of 
Silver Peak, reaching a small, pretty basin. The snow was very icy, so I 
retraced my steps, and had a fun ski down the meadow, then a looong 
ride back to the flats. 


### Stevens Pass Skiing, 12/27/1999

I didn't have enough before, so I went back and tackled more of the easier
blue runs. There still hadn't been any new snow, so things were getting hard
and icy! I had a great time, but my stuffed-up sinuses (small cold) hurt
as I drove down from the pass. On the way back, I checked out the road to
Mt. Persis, finding it drivable to above 3000 feet to a pretty valley.


### Stevens Pass Skiing, 12/25/1999
Kris and I had a great time and alternating blue sky/fog today. She did very
well on the green runs, as did I. We learned how to fall properly!


### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, 12/19/1999

Before the lifts opened, I skinned up and skied up and down a short section
of the lift. Soon, an employee of the ski area came and told me to leave.
I half-skied half-fell down the mountain under his watchful eye. I then
went to the level ski trail along Lake Kacheless, giving myself a painful
blister on the right heel.


### Mt. Baker Skiing, 11/27/1999
Kris wore snowshoes and I wore my new skis. We tromped around off the lifts,
then I made a few fun turns and falls in some nice deep powder. It was
fun to see this area for the first time. Lots of snow for November!


### Mount Si, 11/20/1999
Kris and I planned to get up at 5 am, but actually left the house
at 8, a much more sensible choice! We hiked up, finding umbrellas
useful as recent snow melted from the trees above us, dropping
carpet bombs on hapless toilers. We turned around at the 3 mile
marker when the path become slushy and snowy.


### Paradise Skiing, 11/14/1999
Peter and I hiked up in miserable rain to an area below
Panorama Point for some telemark skiing. Within a few hours, there
was quite a crowd of free-styling snowboarders and skiers doing some
excellent telemark turns. We got back to the car soaking wet in 
the afternoon, and were interviewed on channel 4 news about the
2 missing climbers.


### Mount Si, 10/24/1999
Finally Kris and I had a full day for this trip, and a beautiful day
it was! It was cold and damp in the forest, and infrequent spatterings
of sun kept us moving to the top, where we could rest in the sun,
and survey the views. It was Kris's first time to the top of the
trail, and we held a small party for two. We saw many people and
dogs going up and down. All manner of people: serious and smiling,
tricked out in plastic and chalk bags, or ready for a city stroll.


### Bandera Mountain, 10/21/1999
We walked the 1.5 mile abandoned road and about 1/2 mile of the trail
this afternoon. The views were wonderful, and I got to show Kris
a new trail.


### Gem Lake, 10/16/1999
Peter and I decided to climb the West Ridge of Snoqualmie Peak.
We quickly hiked up the Snow Lake trail on an ambitious pre-dawn
start. As the sky lightened, we turned onto the west ridge, following
a nice trail. Within 500 feet, the trail ended at a cliff, with
imposing spires beyond. Not prepared for anything harder than
class 3, we didn't bring a rope for this 5th class terrain!
The only way around would be to abandon the ridge, descending 
hundreds of feet down one side or the other. Oh well! So we
hiked to Gem Lake and went up a small peak on the right. 
We had an awesome view
of the North Ridge of Kaleetan Peak, and vowed to climb this
later! Great views of the Middle Fork country, and mountains
to the north all the way to Mt. Baker. On the way back, I slipped
on an icy log and got a small cut on the left hand. Then we
hurried so Peter could catch a football game. It was fun and
educational!


### Snow Lake, 9/29/1999
Hoping to run into friend Matt L., Kris and I walked to Snow Lake after work.
In our tennis shoes, just carrying a bottle of water, we were accosted
for heading up "so late" by one descending party. At the overlook
for the lake, we looked for signs of Matt's WTA work party but saw
no one. It was still a wonderful hike, and our first visit to this
popular area. I pointed out the Tooth to Kris.


### Vantage Climbing, 9/26/1999
Peter and I climbed "3 Virgins and a Mule", a trad 5.7 route that was a
little creepy with our small rack, oriented for the Tooth (but it was
raining/snowing there). I brought Peter up to a nut belay halfway up
the pitch so he could clean gear for me to continue! Peter led an
awesome 5.8, then I led "Clip 'em or Skip 'em" just to the right.
A fun alternative to giving up after rain at the Tooth.

### Hidden Lake Peaks, 9/25/1999
The drive was long, but we had great views of Johannesburg Mountain
near the end, and clear blue skies.
However, Kris wasn't feeling very well, so we hiked about a mile 
and turned around. Oh well, another time!


### Mount Si, 9/22/1999
A great after work hike. Kris and I made it to the 3 mile mark before turning
around due to darkness.


### East Wilman's Spire Attempt, 9/12/1999 
Peter, Bob and I rode bikes up
the Monte Cristo Road, impressed with how much this sped the process of getting
there! Another climber pulled up as we locked our bikes, and laughed at the
notion of approaching the spire via the brushy west slope. "No one goes that
way anymore!" We weren't prepared for steep snow, so we headed up anyway. We
found a new trail through brush, then emerged into a long rocky gully that led
up the mountain.  Navigating remnant house-sized blocks of snow, we found
evidence of a former tram-line with a long rusted cable. The rock got better,
but steeper, and finally we were climbing very exposed slabby rock. Peter
climbed a 5th class slab and looked around a corner, finding only steeper slopes
above. With still 1000 feet to get to the base of the darn climb, we turned
around, beginning a long, tedious descent down the rotten gully.  The scenery
was pretty, and we could see that the trail through brush had been created to
access a little cabin up the valley. A pleasant column of smoke was rising from
the chimney. Bob sprained his ankle on the hike down.  My bike chain broke on
the ride out. Peter towed me with the aid of a long stick. We decided our
approach was all wrong back in Monte Cristo when we saw a landmark (The Count of
Monte Cristo) we were supposed to pass. We were further up the valley than that.

### Blanca Lake, 9/11/1999
Kris and I got to the trailhead around 1:30 pm for this "100 Classic" hike.
We switch-backed slowly but steadily up the steep trail. The sky was blue,
and we stayed cool in the forest. We were amused but saddened by a party
of three, where two were very impatient with one straggler who wasn't in
the same shape. They kept huffing ahead, then waiting impatiently for the
increasingly hurt third member who was happy to chug along at her own
pace. Finally we passed this unhappy trio, and we soon sitting near the
turquoise water of the glacial-fed lake. The bugs were mildly annoying.
Heading back, we hastened against darkness, finally using a headlamp on
the last mile. Kris and I had a wonderful time!


### Mount Si, 9/9/1999
A training hike for Kris, who harbors Rainier ambitions! We went after work
and got in 1.5 miles at a steady pace.


### Little Si, 9/6/1999
Kris and I left in the late afternoon for this hike. Last year, I scrambled
up the other side of the peak, and mistakenly thought the trail couldn't be
more than a mile. Well, it was two pretty steep miles, so after a few fun
minutes on top we had to race down, scurrying through the premature darkness
in the rain forest below. An evil rotting stump extracted an injury to Kris's
leg, but I pushed it off the trail. We really enjoyed ourselves anyway.


### High Rock Lookout, 8/28/1999
Joey, Arwin, Kris and I took this easy hike to a lookout with grand views
north to Mt. Rainier. At the dramatic cliffs, we spied a lazy Marmot sunning
himself and looking down 1000 feet. He'd saunter away when we approached.
We met Bud, the lookout attendant for the last 15 years. We'd seen him on
TV, as he was something of a minor celebrity. The old gaffer told tales
of long hikes when he was a kid, and was just a really interesting guy.
He told us we had behaved well, and gave us a nice goodbye. We caught a
beautiful sunset on the way down.


### Mt. Forgotten Meadows (Perry Creek), 8/15/1999

I left the trailhead at 8:15 am, and entered the lowering clouds just 
before Perry Creek Falls. The views to remnant waterfalls across the 
valley had been great until then. From the Falls, I continued on 
snow-free trail to the Mt. Forgotten Meadows in increasing rain. My 
schemes for attaining the summit fizzled in the steady drizzle, and 
I forgot all about it, my mind as blank and gray as the drabby day. 
I thought about the second ascent of "Not Stilly, Silly! Peak," but 
my limbs were careening down, not up! 


### Whistler Hiking, 8/4/1999
Kris and I thought this would be fun, with trams taking you to high country hikes
above timberline. But the trails were closed due to snow, and the many ominous
warnings about (god forbid) walking on snow deterred us from exploring. We
did manage a grueling 3000 foot descent hike from the tram's terminus, 
hoping to spot bears feasting on berries. Alas, we saw none, but we did get
sprayed by dirt from sewage treatment trucks driving up the many dirt roads
that the trail crossed. We suffered, but managed to have fun too. However,
I would never, ever recommend anyone believe the hype about hiking at Whistler
during the summer! It was expensive and very industrial. We couldn't wait
to get home.


### Vantage, 7/4/1999
We spent a lazy morning at home, not ready to move until 2 pm, making
for possibly the latest start for the drive to Vantage anybody has
ever done! We arrived at 4:30, and Kris did very well on her first
outdoor climb at the Feathers. We climbed a 5.3 route, and Kris 
executed her first rappel. Later, we hiked through the Tunnel and I
climbed Peaceful Warrior. This is something we should do together
more often!


### Castle Rock, 6/27/1999
Kris and I met Bob Scoverski and Steve H. at the Castle near Leavenworth
for some easy trad climbing on Midway (5.6). Bob led the first pitch
up the side of Jello Tower, finding it a bit intimidating but doing
an outstanding job nonetheless. Steve followed pretty well on his first
rock climb on real rock (right Steve?). Later, I led the top two pitches,
doing it in two because of some pretty excessive rope drag (should have
used a longer sling down low!). It was warm and sunny, while the west
side felt like November. Kris enjoyed watching and comparing us with
an amazing British pair, and she saw a kind of scary lead fall on the
5.8 crack on the Tower left of Midway. Everyone was ok though.


### Mount Si, 6/6/1999
John and I started up the 
trail at 2:00 pm, and despite a weird 5 minute rain squall, found ourselves on 
the summit with views to downtown Seattle. We clambered cautiously on the 
Haystack, coming down as round pellets of graupel snow came from above, 
collecting like mothballs in corners. As we headed down, snow turned to gentle 
rain. Lots of friendly people on the trail. 


### Kendall Peak Area, 5/23/1999

This was a 4 hour trip to the Snoqualmie Pass area for some snow
walking and climbing. I started hiking from the Alpental Road at
noon, working my way up the Commonwealth Valley. After a waterfall,
I started switch-backing steeply up the mountain on the right.
Finally, I came into a basin under what the map shows as Kendall
Peak. Ascending on a diagonal, I reached a saddle at 5200 feet.
There was a great view across to the real Kendall Peak above the
Kendall lakes. I decided to climb the fake Kendall, so followed
old snowshoe tracks on steepening snow up to some exposed rocks.
Here, I tried to get water from a melting cornice, but my nerve
failed me! I continued on to the summit ridge, alarmed by the
watery condition of the snow. A dicey traverse was made easier by
stamping snow down for deep, exaggerated steps. I turned around
30 feet below the summit because of some exposed 5th class climbing
that I knew would be hard to descent. Going down was quick, and
for a short cut, I traveled along a ridge and came straight down
through forest to the parking area using a compass bearing.


### Snoqualmie/Bandera Mountains, 5/16/1999

I climbed about 1000 feet up from the Alpental parking lot, attempting
to reach Cave Ridge, and thence to Snoqualmie Mountain. The steep
snow and cliffs were more than I felt like dealing with today,
so after some careful down-climbing, I headed west for an easier
climb of Bandera Mountain. The trail was snowcovered from where it
leaves the old roadbed, heading straight up to a ridge. Despite rain,
then snow, the trip was enjoyable since I was prepared to get soaking
wet! Heavy wind at the summit kept me from lingering, and though a
cloud preened in my face, I got a few glimpses of I-90 far below, and
a good view of Mason Lake, just below a ridge. 10 minutes of glorious
glissading got me off the snow in record time, as I just slid crazily
down the fall line. It took me right to where the trail leaves the
roadbed! My buttocks were frozen for the next 30 minutes of walking
down to the car...


### Index climbing - Great Northern Slab, 4/17/1999
My third time to climb Great Northern Slab, this time with
Bob S., an amazing climber who has concentrated exclusively 
on sport routes. This was my chance to show him something
new, and he took to it well, placing gear on lead by the
third pitch. The rock was getting wet due to increasing
rain but the crowds had just arrived when we reached the
base. Our rappel rope became stuck, and Jeff (see the skiing
trip below) handily showed up from on high to free it. 
Thanks Jeff!


### Barclay Lake, 4/15/1999

There was about a mile of snow to walk before the trailhead, and 
continual snow on the trail. Despite footprints by the thousands, 
I saw no one on this sunny afternoon until reaching the lake. There, 
two campers and I shared Pepperoni sticks and watched avalanches 
descend from Baring's north face. One had come within 20 feet of 
the lake. They also saw a huge one come down from Merchant Peak, 
uncovering an acre of steep bare rock high on the mountain. This 
was a great place to sit in the sun and contemplate the years of 
struggle climbers put into climbing the forbidding wall above. But 
when the sun hid behind the mountain, it was time for me to go, as 
it became distinctly cold! 


### Cowboy Mountain at Steven's Pass, 4/16/1999

Endless brush defeated my plans to climb Grotto Mountain, so I 
headed to Steven's Pass looking for snow. This made a really 
fun half day trip for snow climbing/hiking. I headed up to the 
obvious Cowboy Mountain, sometimes in timber, sometimes along 
the closed ski lift. Well-frozen conditions up to the ridge 
provided a fun crampon workout. Once on top, I followed old tracks 
up and down the ridge around to the south and east. Be sure to stay 
well back from the ridge top due to large cornices. Near the 
powerlines, I glissaded down from the ridge and returned to the parking 
lot via gentle ski runs. It was a hot day, and I was able to avoid all 
south/southeast facing slopes on this trip.  


### Morning hike to Mt. Stickney, 4/14/1999

Time for my annual before-work hike. The goal was to 
get near Mt. Stickney, a lesser-known peak rising to 
5000 feet from the Sultan Basin. I parked the car when 
snow covered the pothole-infested road, and headed up on
snowshoes. The time was 4:20 am, and I was burping chili from the
night before. The taste kept me company as I crossed blow-downs and 
concentrated on the little circle of snow my lamp
illuminated before me. I turned off of the main road, 
taking a permanently closed branch and the sky became a 
little less dark. Small deciduous trees scrabbled at my 
eyes, and the descents from snow to creekbed then back 
to the snow became more labored. Enter the avalanche 
debris, tilting the plane by 25, then 30 degrees. 
Scoured chutes provided quick and final exits to the 
valley floor. No thanks, said I, exchanging the 
snowshoes for crampons. Thus girded, my march continued 
on well frozen snow. Crunch, crunch, crunch, and the 
darkness retreated. I saw my mountain ahead - a high 
hump with two sharp brothers behind. Too far. Near the 
end of the road, the worst debris yet. The ax refused 
to shake hands with it firmly. I was too slow! A 
consolation prize: kicking up to the ridge saddle in 
Section 10, 3600 ft. Watching the sun rise over 
Stickney, the Crested Buttes, and many others. It is 
enough. Home by 9:30, and off to work.


### Silver Peak, Frog Lake, 2/28/1999
![Skiing at Silver Peak](images/articles/trips/1999/steep.jpg)

I admitted to being a terrible skier, but given the chance to try out 
Randonee gear in the backcountry with an expert was just too tempting. 
Our goal was to climb Silver Peak from the Hyak ski area parking lot, 
going past Frog Lake, over Windy Pass, and under the north side of the 
peak to a relatively gentle ridge leading south and up. We quickly skinned 
up the closed lifts in improving weather. Sunbreaks became more common 
as we cut through the forest towards the Lake. Well, somehow we missed 
it, but attained Windy Pass anyway. A (for me) terrifying descent to a 
meadow at 3800 ft., then into the forest under a northern buttress of 
Silver Peak. Visibility degraded, but glimpses of the mountain were 
inspiring. Running out of time, we decided to climb a colouir to this 
impressive north buttress. Jeff skinned up higher than me, while I punched 
deep holes in the steep slope with boots and ice ax. As we both continued 
on foot, wind roared down the colouir, piling up ball-bearing snow very, 
very quickly. With one look at each other we decided to get away! I glissaded 
down and Jeff skied, getting to safety minutes later. It was getting late, 
and we had a long trip back. I learned a lot, at the expense of Jeff standing 
around waiting for me to recover from yet another faceplant! Visibility was 
very poor, and we ended up following others' tracks to the x-country ski area, 
reaching the car at 6:15. This was a very long tour in bad weather. We felt 
safe from av danger everywhere but the aborted colouir. 



### Skiing the Methow, 2/20-21/1999
Kris and I visited the 
Sun Mountain Lodge for a weekend of relaxation and
skiing.  Boy, the sunny east side of the mountains was
exactly what we needed.  There was fresh snow Sunday morning,
and I ventured off-track, discovering that I want to be a
backcountry skier!  Traversing up a big, gentle hill, looking
with benevolence on the valley below...ahh.  Kris got some
horse, mountain and sunrise pictures, and we can't wait to
see them.


### Index Aid Climbing, 2/13/1999
Alex K. showed me the ropes and unraveled the mystery
of etriers and daisy chains on the Lower Town Wall.  I
pulled a muscle during an awkward jumar.  Man, cleaning
traverses are tough!  Top-roping the lower part of Ironhorse
was the highlight of this cold, rainy day.  Alex had
some fun when a hook placement ripped out twice.


### Colchuck Lake Area, with Matthias, 1/23-24/1999
![Matthias skiing](images/articles/trips/1999/skier.jpg)

Saturday morning we set out from the Bridge Creek Campground, hoping to camp at 
Colchuck Lake for a climb the next day. But a minor car accident delayed our 
start until 10:30. The 3 miles up the snow covered road were pleasant until we had 
to break trail through the deep, wet snow! We made it 1/2 mile in on the trail, then 
set up camp near the creek. It was a very cold night with beautiful stars. Pulling on 
frozen boots in the morning, we continued on, losing the trail somewhere after 
the footbridge over Mountaineer Creek. Ending up on the opposite ridge (looking 
SE to Colchuck Lake), we decided to climb to the top. We topped out at Pt. 6866 
and named it "Master of Puppets" for the deep, will-shattering snow. The view 
was awesome, giving an all-around panorama of Mt. Stuart, Dragontail, Colchuck 
and others on a beautiful clear day. The incredible feeling of solitude and 
great weather made all the hard work worth it. Matthias had AT gear and I had 
snowshoes, so he was poised to enjoy the virgin downhill runs, and boy did he 
ever. He proclaimed the powder to be in excellent condition. I schulumped down 
in big strides, tired but happy. Back to camp, then a long walk out (for me). 
But I got to watch the moon rise and the stars come out, walking alone in the 
magical night.
