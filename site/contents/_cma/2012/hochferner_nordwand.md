Basti, Georg and I drove down to the Pfitschtal in Südtirol Friday evening.
We got some pizza for dinner in Sterzing, then drove up to the parking
lot at the end of the valley. Another party was at the car, and said their
two friends had just started hiking up to the Gunther Messner bivouac hut,
where we were going too. Satisfied that it wouldn't be too crowded, we
packed up our rope, ice tools, snowshoes and other gear, and started hiking
at 8:30 pm. It was great to be out on a summery evening, hiking up a snow-free
trail. We followed it as long as we could without headlamps, which got
us to snowfields, and then we could reliably follow some tracks in the
snow up a big moraine to the bivouac hut.

The hut sleeps twelve, and happily there were just 5 of us tonight. By
11 pm, we were ready to sleep, having shared some food with Jörg and Andy,
two guys from Bozen. We all decided to get up around 4:30 am and be hiking
at 5:00 am. We didn't have a stove so no one needed to cook anything. It
was a good night's sleep.
  
  
In the morning, we started out, the Tyroleans a bit ahead. From the hut
we hiked up the moraine about 5 minutes to where we could drop easily onto
the glacier. The Hochferner Glacier rolls and buckles, with a few interesting
seracs. The climb is about 900 meters high, and boasts of an 80-degree
step in the middle. Fun, fun!
  
  
We hiked up to the base of the first ice cliff and promptly avoided it
by a gully on the left. Unfortunately, we suffered some injuries here!
Georg got smacked in the ear by a flying chunk of ice (which hurt quite
a bit...still swollen 2 days later, he says). Basti got hit in the arm.
Oh well, if you aren't out the door first on these climbs, you don't really
get to complain!

_A bit of black ice...dirty and hard!_
  
  
Above the gully, there was a mandatory bit of hard, black ice for about
40 meters. That was a nice wake up call! Now fully awake, we continued
up easier (40-50 degree?) slopes for a while to the base of the upper bulge.
We decided to tackle the middle of it, giving us the exciting 80 degree
step, and then the option to link snowfields between blank ice and seracs.
We set a belay beside Andy and Jörg, who apologized for any ice chunks!
Having learned our lessons about gravity, our two parties set off on leads
off to the sides of the belayers. I decided it was my turn to lead since
Georg did the Petersenspitze in March! Basti was like "you guys can fight
for it, I don't care!" At any rate, it was a super fun 30 meter pitch,
where the first 15 meters were really steep. I don't think I ever climbed
"alpine" ice that was so steep, only water ice. I could place two good
ice screws for protection, then easier terrain led to where I could chop
out a little belay stance. Georg and Basti came up, enjoying the pitch
quite a bit.

It made sense for me to continue, this time hopefully as a simul-climb,
trying to keep some amount of protection in. I went quite easily in snow
for a while, then placed a couple of screws at an ice step. Another screw
higher, and then after an approximately 150 meter "pitch" we gained a shelf
below the summit wall. We just continued with the rope on easy but somewhat
tiring steep snow up to the summit ridge, where a small cloud engulfed
us.

Yay! Hochfernerspitze! 3470 meters. We enjoyed the non-view for about
0 seconds, then started down along the ridge, then dropped onto a short
but steep south face with some awkward loose rock. Georg somehow zoomed
down this, then took comical pictures of Basti and I contorting ourselves
among the stacked blocks! We stomped down snow to a flat place for some
food and water.

_On top!_
  
  
I'd grown to like the horrible "power energy drink" I bought the night
before. Sickly sweet, almost sticky, I began to fear the liquid was contaminated
with "prions" that would lodge in my brain somewhere. Diluting with water
by 50% helped, and finally the massive energy drain of the ice face did
the rest. Now I could declare it a good drink!
  
  
Andy and Jörg came down from the summit and joined us at our lunch spot.
It was only 10 am! I think we were pretty fast overall. We had great conditions
on the route, and the descent would prove to be similar. Eventually we
set off down the Weisskarferner (glacier) in snowshoes. The views of Rotes
Beil (2949 m) and surrounding mountains were inviting. These Zillertal
peaks have sweeping bands of near vertical rock which lend drama to the
scene. Sadly the rock is not good for climbing!

We reached trail and took off snowshoes. The trail was kind of annoying,
as it seemed like it was always climbing up to remain high above the Gliderbach
valley floor. But a "balcony" trail on the side of a valley is always amazing
for views, so I have to give it that. We slowly made our way down, reaching
some abandoned huts above the Oberbergbach that we climbed along the night
before. A few more minutes and we were at the car, me trailing behind to
give me knees some comfort, and to stop and drink from cold streams.

What a great trip! It's not as difficult of a climb as I thought it would
be, but the scenery, opportunity for conditioning and companionship were
excellent. Good weather made it possible! Thanks to Georg for driving too!

(a postscript: coming back to Munich, I couldn't take my normal U-bahn
home from Georg's house, due to the impending Fußball game between Munich
and Chelsea. I finally had to walk, in wet mountain boots and gear, with
a pile of snowshoes and ice tools, across the city to get home! Every taxi
had an Englishman or three already in it!
