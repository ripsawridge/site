## The Hohe Ferse

I had the weekend free to hike, so I drove down to Italy dodging
rain and clouds. I decided to explore the valley on the north side of
the Jaufenpass. With the fresh snow, could I find a steep and interesting
hike on a south-facing slope to a summit?

I settled on a curious trail that began at a "barefoot hiking path" under
the Ratschinger Kreuz summit. The way was very steep, passing beautiful
long streams flowing down from the peaks, still in cloud. I reached the
summit in a bit of fresh snow, then began traversing the ridge over to
the Hohe Ferse. My hope was to traverse the whole ridge and come down
to the Staudenbergerjöchl far to the west. But the snow because quite
slippery as it deepened on the steep grassy slopes. I had to be quite careful.
Eventually I doubted I would even reach the Hohe Ferse, and I was constantly
making sure I hadn't climbed up something I couldn't get back down.

The trail gained the ridge here and there, then beetled off again into a
steep slope on the south side. A short vertical wall bedeckt with ice and snow
was the final obstacle. I could climb it because of a few good holds. I stood
on the summit and realized there was no way I should try and continue:
it was a white-line nightmare off to the west. Without boots and crampons
and axe (semi-useless, because the snow depth wasn't enough to be productive),
it was time to turn back.

I did this, and despite forboding, it went more quickly than expected. I
hiked down then decided to spend the night at a hut near the Jaufenpass.
1300 meters up and down.

## The Pfandlspitz

The next day I decided to park above a cluster of houses called Prantach
above St. Martin in Passeier, and visit the high country on this ridge
south of the Jaufenpass. I walked the very interesting "Hans Hofer Trail,"
which told of the final months of Tirolean hero Hans Hofer, before his
execution by the foreign power usurping the wealth of his native land.
It's always the globalists against the local people, isn't it?

Anyway, I reached the hut where he stayed and was captured. Rather moving,
I have to learn more about him. Above this, the trail got steeper and
reached timberline country, making a beautiful traverse of a valley before
dropping a bit to the Hintereggalm. I continued up into this valley though,
really impressed with the pretty country below the Grünangerjoch which
marks the ridge crest. Clouds flowed in and out as I reached the 'joch,
then continued north to the Pfandlspitz, a minor summit on the way to the
giant of the Samnaun mountains, the Alplerspitz. I had learned my lesson
about fresh snow the day before, so I was happy to leave that mountain alone
for now. Instead I turned north down into the Fartleis Valley, a beautiful
place of waterfalls.

Some farmers were recovering their goats, which had wandered onto cliffs
beside a road. They had me wait 10 minutes until they could coax the goats
back to the road by throwing rocks over the cliff. Really nice folks.

I had a long walk down the valley, finally ending on a pleasant road traversing
the west wall above a raging river. I came out of the valley and ascended slightly
over the next mile or so to reach my car. 1700 meters up and down.
