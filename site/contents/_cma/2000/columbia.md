I was changing jobs at work, and had the opportunity to use a vacation
day. As usual, my eyes glazed over with happiness! I looked at the
green Beckey Book. hmmm....the Monte Cristo Peaks, but only if the
weather is beautiful all over the state (it's a great place to go if
you like bailing due to weather!). I crossed my fingers, really
wanting to visit this area which is quite close to home, but usually
shrouded in thick mist and cloud. Jeff S. suggested Columbia Peak,
which is a mere 2.5 miles from the old mining town. He had climbed it
in late August, and gave me a detailed document that described the
route. I wanted to ride a bike into the old town (I hate nothing more
than walking roads for 8 miles!), but I didn't have a bike of my
own. Kris's mountain bike would have to do, although I'm thankful that
nobody saw me hunched over, knees-to-neck on the undersized model! The
front tire chronically leaked, so I bought a small bike pump,
resolving to stop every mile and deal with it.


Early Wednesday morning I arrived at Barlow Pass, quickly jumping on
the bike and taking off in cold, damp air. Typically, low clouds
filled the valley, and I whimpered inwardly, visions of sunny
traverses on rocky ledges dissipating. I arrived in town after an
hour, leaving the bike in the brush some distance up the trail to
Poodle Dog Pass. I spent another hour getting there, clambering over
roots and rocks on this very rough trail. A Poodle Dog is a marmot,
this was an old miner's term. I wondered about a life spent toiling
for ore in this damp, rocky place.

At the pass I continued south on a ridge towards Twin Lakes. This way-trail
was much better than the "maintained trail" before. I was getting
above the clouds! Silvertip Peak loomed to the west, becoming crisper as
I climbed. Eventually, the sun came over the Wilman's Spires, and my
damp clothing began to dry. The trail spent a long time traversing
a slope above the Silver Creek drainage. I knew a trail down
there would take you to abandoned Silver City and Galena, and finally
to the curious town of Index. I steamed ahead, eager to get my first
real view of Columbia.


Finally, at a pretty rock and heather garden near Twin Lakes, the mountain was
visible and massive, making up the skyline before me and left. The route looked
improbably steep, especially the final 1000 feet. Jeff assured me the climb was
class 3, and I had brought crampons and ice ax as he advised. I could just
barely see one snowfield though. Mostly the mountain was a collection of rocky
towers, dirty gullies, scree and ledges. I left my soaking shirt here to dry,
and changed into a fresh one.


Leaving the trail, I traversed a basin of rock and snow to meet a long
ridge radiating from below the summit. Faint but good trails led up a
steep heather slope on the north side, then along a very pleasant
traverse of the top and south sides. The Twin Lakes were spectacular,
nestled on an arm of the peak, and glistening a turquoise color. I
moved onto the south side of the ridge, traversing a
scree slope at the base of a cliff. Soon I arrived at a long bench of
snow, stretching off northeast to the '76 Glacier. My eye followed the
glacier around to the opposite end under Wilman's Peak. This makes an
excellent bivy location, if you are so inclined.


Above me, a large black buttress blocked the way. I was supposed to go
up a snowfield on it's left. The snowfield steepens, and you traverse
right on ledges at it's top, then go left up a gully.


I put on crampons for the very hard snow, actually ice. I reveled in the
alpine feeling of the climb, the blue sky and the sun. No sound but
the crunch of my spikes. At the top, I stepped over a moat, quickly
reaching the gully I sought. Jeff described "a rock step," and this
certainly fit the bill. But it was about 30 feet high and icy. I
rationalized that he'd come before the snows, and it may have been
more pleasant. I climbed up, stemming on good rock in the lower
portion. The upper portion didn't inspire confidence. I made heavy use
of the fact that the moss, mud, and rock were frozen into place!


While I brought my hands back to life at the top, I learned I had
taken the wrong gully. The proper one faced south, was low angle, and
had a nice trail coming up! "Oh. That might have been better," I said
aloud. At least I wouldn't have to descend the false gully.


Here the route becomes third class, with bits of trail on the left
side of the vast central gully which comes down all the way from the
summit block. I went forward with anticipation, wondering what
obstacle would come next. I wandered too far to the left, looking down
cliffs to the '76 Glacier. Continuing up, I was soon at the base
of the summit block, about 150 feet high at this point. A cairn and
ledge led to the left and around a corner. I followed eagerly.


On this side of the mountain, there were heaps of snow piled on
ledges, all powdery and unconsolidated. The rock underneath was icy,
and kicking steps wasn't useful in 4 inches of powder. I started
walking the snowy ledge, but merely 10 feet before the wide, safe
ridge-top I came to an impasse. Normally, this ground would be very
exposed but very easy. Today, the fact that all steps were insecure,
and I couldn't find or manufacture hand holds in the wall made it
dangerous. Patiently, I scoured the snowy wall like a grid, testing
with ice ax, clearing snow from slabs, looking for cracks. Since I
couldn't get any kind of self-belay I reluctantly turned back. Even
this was hard! I hated to give up just below the summit. Also, the
views over to Kyes Peak and other summits to the west were blocked by
a ridge. Had I been able to see over there, I may have been content to
turn around, feeling good about a near-panoramic view at least.


But I gave it another try, this time on a ledge closer to the
cliff-edge, but with more snow, where I could kick actual steps. In
the same area, I ran into a similar problem, but here, the slope above
me was dirt, actually frozen mud! The ax provided a solid belay here,
but I still had tenuous upward progress on bits of rock, frozen mud and
powder. With my feet on welcome rock, I pondered the final moves
dubiously. Eventually, I realized I could chop steps in the frozen
mud, just like you would do on ice. ("Why didn't you use crampons?" -
I left them above the snowfield below!)


Once on the ridge-top, I admired my handiwork: black holes in a wall of
dirty snow. I wondered what someone else would think upon coming this
way! Now, only the scramble to the summit remained, and I wouldn't be
easily dissuaded. I climbed a steep but blocky chimney, then a small
face. It was fun and warm as long as I avoided the icy north side
above my snowy "rubicon." And on the summit I stood, looking at all my
mountains, feeling proud and thankful for the day. I tried to do many
things at once: eating, reading the summit register, taking pictures,
and with an undercurrent of tension, looking for another way down. If
I could avoid the frozen mud, I'd be very happy!


On the opposite side of the summit wedge, I saw that relatively
low-angled sunny ledges could take me to a short, icy gully on the
south ridge. Climbing that, I could drop down the other side, then
traverse northwest there. With luck, this would take me to the top of
the central gully, where I could walk to the cairn and snowy ledge
where the difficulties began. I had to try it, it would be fun, too.


I down-climbed from the summit, easily traversing under the back
side. The gully was easy to climb up, but the descent of the other
side was harder. After going down a reasonable way, I
attempted to traverse back. Before I knew it, I was looking down the
central gully, pleased at having "encircled" the summit block, and
avoiding the dicey terrain. I descended, concentrating on hands and
feet, trying to follow my route up. Soon, metallic buzzing noises
sounded on my left: rocks whizzing down the gully. Now that the sun
was out, they were unfreezing, and coming down at regular 3 minute
intervals. Happily I was able to stay right, and eventually leave the
central gully completely.


I quickly descended the "proper" gully and "rock step" (5 feet of a
5.0 bouldering move, I think). Putting on crampons, I got to practice
flat-footed descent on the ice, slamming 10 points in on each step,
sending small shards of ice skidding away. Now below the black
buttress, I looked back to admire the peak. It had been a challenging
and exciting climb. It's not a walk-up at all. But it's not hard
either. It is 3rd class if you do everything right. It reminded me
quite a bit of Mt. Teewinot in the Tetons, on a smaller scale. It
doesn't get climbed very much, but it's a special climb for me.

In a boulder and heather garden I napped for 30 minutes. Back on the
trail, I found the best huckleberries I'd ever eaten, harvesting by
the dozens. I had gotten an exertion headache, but by taking off my
shirt, and moving down smoothly it went away. I admired the Sheep Gap
mountains to the west, which looked very rugged and exciting. Beckey's
comments about Sheep Gap and the vicinity are tantalizing. He calls
the mountain "relatively unknown to climbers," but it "deserves more
attention." If that isn't a call to arms, I never heard one...


Singing random songs got me down to the bike, it was a long trip down
wet slabs and rooty trail. I forgot to mention that I'd forgotten
iodine pills, so I only had one quart of water for the day. I would
have brought myself to drink from the many streams along the trail if:


1. There had not been active mining in Gothic Basin until the 1960s.
2. I hadn't read somewhere that cyanide was used in mining processes!
3. The water had not collected in pools of industrial-looking foam!!


As it was, I did get a quart from a pristine tarn in the heather/rock
garden country, and that was enough.


The bike ride back was such fun, mostly downhill, lots of coasting and
making furtive glances to peaks like Del Campo and Forgotten. Back at
the car, I met a couple who had hiked to Glacier Basin. These were the
only people I saw all day and it felt awkward to talk.
