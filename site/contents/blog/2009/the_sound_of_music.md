I grew up watching this movie, it was a favorite of my mom's. To this
day, if you catch me whistling, it'll be a song from the musical. Okay,
in my darker moods it'll be "The Imperial March Theme" from The Empire
Strikes Back, but otherwise it'll be something from the Sound of Music.
  
  
Kris and I were puzzled at how few Germans know this musical, and of that
set how few like it (we found no one). Usually people make a funny face
and object using the word "kitsch." "But it's a good movie," I'll protest
to no avail.

I stumbled across this article about a showing of the musical in Vienna.
The story took place at a painful time in Austrian history, and folks there
found it easier to forget that many Austrians were happy about the _Anschluss_ with
Nazi Germany. But now time has passed and maybe people in Austria can see
why the rest of the world loves the story so much (including the Lederhosen
and other kitschy elements).

[Another article](http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/winter/von-trapps.html) illuminates
the painful choice the family made to leave Austria:
  
  

> _  
> When the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, the von Trapps realized that they were on thin ice with a regime they abhorred. Georg not only refused to fly the Nazi flag on their house, but he also declined a naval command and a request to sing at Hitler's birthday party. They were also becoming aware of the Nazis' anti-religious propaganda and policies, the pervasive fear that those around them could be acting as spies for the Nazis, and the brainwashing of children against their parents. They weighed staying in Austria and taking advantage of the enticements the Nazis were offering---greater fame as a singing group, a medical doctor's position for Rupert, and a renewed naval career for Georg---against leaving behind everything they knew---their friends, family, estate, and all their possessions. They decided that they could not compromise their principles and left.
