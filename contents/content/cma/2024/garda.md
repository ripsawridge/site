## Monte Casale

I scrambled up the [Che Guevara Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/ferrata-ernesto-che-guevara-klettersteig/). The linked website says it
is closed but I saw no closure signs. There were two spots with a broken
cable, but it seems to be in pretty good shape otherwise.

## Via Ferrata Dell'Amicizia

Today I merely had to walk across town from my place to the base of Cima
Sat to start the [Via Ferrata Dell'Amicizia](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/via-ferrata-dell-amicizia-klettersteig/).

## Fennberg Klettersteig

Now in the main valley, I got a late start on the [Fennberg Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/fennberg-klettersteig/), walking for about
an hour south from the wine village of Margreid to the base of the cliff.
Interestingly, Fennberg doesn't really have a summit -- I've used the nearby
GPS point of *Giggeregg* to mark the summit even though I didn't walk over to
it once on top (probably 10 minutes away).
