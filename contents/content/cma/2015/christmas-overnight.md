I started hiking into the Kloo-Ascher Valley with bivouac gear, hoping there wasn't too much
snow on the north side of the Hinteres Sonnwendjoch and Krenspitze. I slept on the Krenspitze summit.

Good weather.

On the way down I followed a road then went cross country down to the east until meeting a road
switchbacking up to the Wildenkarsattel which I came through the day before. I then followed
the sunny and snowfree ridge to the Sch√∂nfeldalm, and thence steeply down to the road and
the car.

2000 meters up/down.
