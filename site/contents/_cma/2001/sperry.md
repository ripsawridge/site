January 6, 2001

Jake had emailed me, saying he wanted to do a trip this weekend. By the time
Thursday rolled around, I was pretty excited about going out.  Some pressing
bugs at work kept my enthusiasm low until Friday, when answers came at the last
minute. I talked to Peter, who had plans to climb Bandera with Kim. I was ready
for a slugfest though, so eagerly signed on to Chris and Jake's idea for Sperry
Peak.  (as it turns out, Peter and Kim had a bushwhacking slugfest of their
own!).


It was great to finally climb with Chris K., who is very strong and experienced.
His tale of a grueling three day trip to Mt. Challenger last summer fired Jake
and I up for an attempt this year. July of 2001?  They picked me up at 6 am, and
we began walking up the Sunrise Mine road at 7:45 am. Right away, Chris took off
in his trademark long strides. How am I gonna keep up with this guy?

The day was beautiful -- high pressure, no clouds, crisp alpine
vistas of Big Four Mountain and Del Campo peak as we hiked the road.
Soon we entered a cramped forest trail, hopping around on slick
roots and little streams. We emerged in a clearing where two
rivers converged. After two awkward crossings, we traversed a brushy
slope to gain Wirtz Basin below Headlee Pass. The traverse was
tiring, with rotten holes in the snow, thin avalanche gullies,
and deep rocky creekbeds. We emerged above the Basin, looking hopefully
down sheer cliffs to the basin floor, some 300 to 500 feet below.
After going up and down these cliffs and contemplating down-climbing,
we did the right thing and hiked back, down and around to enter the
basin at the only logical place.


Gamely, we kept going. Although one of Chris's snowshoes broke here,
and he spent the rest of the day with one snowshoe on. At the same
time, he kicked steps out in front all day too! Jake and I pleaded
*"Please, take one of our snowshoes, it's bad enough that you are
wasting us, don't humiliate us too!!"*
But he seemed to take a secret
delight in doing without. I imagined myself with a dunce cap and
toiled on.


But what a great place to toil! Morning Star is ahead and to the left,
while Sperry practically seethes above us on the right. It's flanks
steamed with runnels of melting ice, and an unnaturally blue sky above
the craggy summits seemed to add elevation and seriousness. The
routes on the east face were all hard, and didn't interest us today.
Instead, we made an abrupt right turn before the basin headed out in
cliffs. I'd heard much about the steep slopes to Headlee Pass, but
it wasn't as steep as I'd thought. The snow was good, aside from a 50
foot section of thin cover over a hard, icy crust. Chris broke most
of the way, although I did get an exhausting turn on the endless slope.
I also got some good advice from Chris, who recommended really stamping
the snow down with each kick step. I wasn't doing this, so every now
and then a step would collapse, putting me about 3 feet below a previous
step! Attempts to extract myself just dug me deeper into a hole. I'll
remember this. Chris never had that problem.


We were in the sun for the first time on the other side, and I led the
way up to a level area looking down on Lake Elan in the saddle between
Vesper and Sperry Peaks. The elevation was around 5000 feet. We debated
the route from here. Sperry rose up in a wall with minor gullies, and
little ice chunks constantly came down as it baked in the sun. Jake was
keen to try a gully that appeared to level off a few hundred feet above.
Chris and I were worried that it wouldn't level off much, and then we'd
have a maze of gullies for upward progress. Finally, we dropped a bit
closer to the lake and continued around it some distance to ascend
steeply left of a wide colouir. Halfway up this I couldn't ignore all
the warning lights in my head anymore, so I turned around, going back
to the level area to wait. I wasn't unhappy with this decision because
1) it was after 2:00 pm, 2) we needed daylight to navigate below Wirtz
Basin, 3) I was tired, 4) the hot sun and melting slope gave me the
jitters, and 5) I was tired, did I say that?


I wished Chris and Jake luck, watching them with binoculars as they made
slow but steady progress several hundred feet higher. They came to a level
area before the summit, had a good look around, then started back. I
was surprised, but it was a good decision based on the time. In order to
help us along now, I decided to get a head start, and hopefully find
and pioneer the trail we had lost at the basin head before dark. If I
could do it before dark, they could follow my snowshoe tracks even if
they came considerably later.


Getting down to Headlee Pass took me through the most frustrating snowshoe
conditions I'd ever seen. The now-saturated upper layer of snow slid
easily on the rain crust, leaving me slipping and off-balance most of
the way. I was glad to get out of the sun at the Pass, and began retracing
our steps down, facing in at first, but soon finding conditions suitable
for a glissade. After several fun slides, I snowshoed down the basin,
stopping often to listen for Jake and Chris hopefully not far behind.
At the head of the basin, I finally saw them behind me, as tiny black
specs sliding down from the Pass. Good.


It didn't take long to find the clever forest trail we had missed. When
we were in shouting distance, I started down, and soon we were together
again on the brushy slope fighting to get down before full dark. Jake
picked some good landmarks to make for. A large boulder and a short
forest path led us to our river crossings. From here, I raced along our
barely-visible tracks from the morning, reaching the snowfree forest 
path just at full dark...not a minute to spare! We shuddered at the thought
of trackless nighttime wanderings through the brushy forest here. Headlamps
got us back to the road, where the moonlight accompanied us the rest of
the way.


Thanks to Jake and Chris for an excellent winter mountain trip!
We'll be back for the summit.
