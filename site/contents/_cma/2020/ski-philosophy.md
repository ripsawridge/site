## Osterfelderkopf, ~1400 meters up and down on skis

Georg and I set off in light rain/snow mix from the Garmisch ski area.
Almost immediately, snow stuck in huge chunks to his ski skins.

We had an excellent time. We discussed lots of philosophy! I only captured
about 20% of our topics here, in this diary entry I wrote the night after
our day:

> Philosophy is not a way to get from point A to point B.
> It is a way to play once you grew up.
>
> When we were kids, the playground had everything.
> When we are adults, we are told what to think and how to think about it.

Georg and I talked, me tossing out a bunch of things I picked up in early 20th
century occultism books.

"As above, so below," I said, skinning up the slope with poor Georg fighting
the enormous clumps of snow that stuck to his skis. This was the only way I
could stay out in front!

"It's an occult concept. It means when you are imagining a new space, say, a
space in another dimension where you'll never have access...you can take the
things you've learned in this life about how systems and organizations develop,
and you can reasonably apply them to the new, as yet unpopulated space."

I went on. "We are programmers, we understand systems. We know that caches
become filled, or remain underutilized. We know about slow leaks in systems.
About interactions, unpoliced by cleverly situated locking primitives that
ensure multiple threads of control don't crash into each other."

"It's the same 'up there,' or 'out there,' or wherever you are pointing your
consciousness."

Our problems are their problems, whoever they are.

"Whenever I enter these spaces, I'm interested. But I fear that I'm going in
circles. I won't get anywhere," said Georg. "And worse, I might delude myself
into believing I DID get somewhere." He stopped, removed his skis and used
poles to scrape off potato-sized blocks. The fast-falling snow collected around
us.

"That should help," I said. "But why do we want to go anywhere?"

Maybe, I thought, going somewhere is merely a mode of thought that allows us to
hide from the truth: there is nowhere to go.

As if in defiance of this burdensome truth, we continued up the mountain. Georg
slowed down but never stopped by his tumors of snow, ever building under his
feet. My left ski developed one, too. We made it to the Osterfelderkopf after
some tiring trips down and back up. That was a lot of (good) work! Inside, over
a beer, we talked about energy.

"Have you heard of a Dyson sphere?" said Georg, steaming slightly in the
fuggish warmth of the little bistro. "It's a way of harnessing the energy of an
entire sun. It would provide the energy needs of an enormous, galaxy-wide
population."

"How terrible," I said. "Think how awful our fall will be when we need another
one, and can't find a star with the right chemical balance!" Laughing now,
"rather than failing to continue our experiment on one planet, we'll leave a
husk of a galaxy, burnt out and the witness of suffering on an enormous scale."

I'm just not excited about that kind of progress, even though I know I benefit
from it every day. Georg sees the tremendous possibilities, and the beautiful
complexity in the way a new technology opens a slanted context on the world,
which then establishes a new environment whose rules and ideas bear little
resemblance to the old.

Me, I seem...eager, almost, for endings. For the empty larder. For the eventual
confrontation with a starker reality. The planet Saturn looms behind my vision,
awe-inspiring and yet, possibly the final vision perceived with human eyes.

Every cast of thought is a reaction to other thoughts. And all of them take
place within delicate membranes that are not only hierarchical, they
interpenetrate and condition one another. The structure of a new tendril of
thought may be conditioned by the life of the cluster of thoughts before it,
such that as it grows, it reproduces the structural elements of it's parents
experience. In that sense we pick up where they left off.

Suitably filled with beer and warm soup, we skied down. "I forgot HOW to ski!"
I said. "Me too!" said Georg. It had something to do with the tired legs and
the beer. But we got down somehow, enduring long traverses of the mountainside
to reach the final black run that led directly to Georg's van.

A thought experiment: what if you gave the humans a heaven, and set them loose
in it. Would they be happy?

We both agreed, no way, because they become accustomed to every good thing that
comes, then need more to stay happy.

"I think that IS what happened. I think we are in that heaven, but it was given
to us long ago, and now we who are born into it can find no trace of the
original deed. Nor can anyone else. So, the people made wars, driven by desire
to feel more virtuous than others. They then built factories and created paper
wealth, so they could play games of feeling powerful or weak," I said.

"No one remembers the original conditions."

I remembered a theory I had once. That we are Martians who finally used all the
resources of that planet. We came here long ago, fell into primitive life and
forgot our history. And now...we dream of going to Mars in order to escape the
diminishment of resources on this planet! LOL.

How to escape the cycle of getting accustomed to happy things?

"You would need a controlled, minimal environment," said Georg, applying his
thinking to the problem.

"Ah! This is what monks are trying to do!" I exclaimed. "They try to escape the
wheel of desire. They eat the same food every day, and seek to be perfectly
content."

"They try to escape excitement about current conditions," I went on, now
thinking myself. This must be the way. That is, there must be something here
for me.
