### Jog to Buchenheim
_March 9, 2008_

Sunday late afternoon I jogged to Buchenheim, this time starting from the
Deutsches Museum while the kids were napping. The run along the Isar was
(again) really enjoyable. I visited the famous Buchenheim klettergarten, and
spent a few minutes slipping and sliding on the hilariously polished slabs of
rock. 10 miles.
