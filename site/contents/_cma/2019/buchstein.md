We hike up to the Buchstein on a nice Sunday, setting a fantastic pace.
We passed lots of folks, only Rowan seemed a bit tired today. Somehow roles
were reversed. Lately, Rowan keeps up and Elijah stays back. Ever-changing
boys I've got...

Leaving the kids to their electronic dreams, Tamer and I talked about work
(boring), about the history of Turkei and the amazing Attaturk. We talked
about how wisdom seems to emerge in populations independent of how much
access they have to the latest internet news and gadgets. Actually, there
*might* be a relationship, but we'll leave this as an exercise for the reader!

A very popular goal today!

The summit scramble is pretty interesting. I decided on a confident approach,
and by gosh, it worked. The boys and Tamer came right up, the latter looking
a *bit* dubious but willing to try. I described the route as a series of
pleasant moves of moderately elevated risk between spacious and comfy
"safe zones," in various wet caves left or right of the main gully.
We went up easily enough, finding our own special sub-summit to sit on
away from other people and the many bugs which mobbed the very highest point.

We looked out at the Achensee in the distance, and now-snowy peaks here at
summer's end. Rowan described the scheme whereby he is up on the latest memes
despite our parental ban on a reddit account. There is a thrice-daily 
Telegram thread which delivers the best memes to phones, for children in
his predicament precisely (IMHO). Chuckling over his pictures of moon landings
without helmets, of great wooden crucifixes with basketball hoops mounted on
them (okay, there was only one), I liked how he solved a problem.

We went down, me happy to have a student in Tamer for the art of downclimbing
without getting sketched out. "Compress like an accordian! Always look.
Don't get into the habit of lowering a foot until you hopefully land on
something that sticks! This way lies madness..."

We ate some food in the hut, Elijah sharing his theory that CGI ruined movies
about animals from about 1998 to 2010 or beyond. I really like his theory
and I subscribe to it, too. "Homeward Bound" was a fantastic early-90s
movie about 2 runaway dogs and a cat. The only "technology" used to humanize
the animals was a voiceover. This allowed us to empathize with the animals,
while also feeling they were *animals* and therefore what wisdom they
embodied was something of their own, from their own kingdom. Not merely
a replica of ours.

Then, as Elijah continues with an evil grin: the dogs lips begin to move
like human lips as CGI got "better," tempting producers to "jazz it up,"
and demonstrate the improving technology. However, it's disconcerting
to see these odd, rubbery lips on a dog (or a cat). Elijah proposed that
a boy might be given a dog one day. Raised on these movies, he'd expect
it to talk. He'd be flummoxed by the lip and jaw structure of his pet,
expecting an anatomy close to his own. He'd then spend his life hoping
for something that could never be...

This reminded me of a question Rowan asked on the descent: "Would you rather
live in a virtual world or a real world?" I was firmly on the side of the real,
feeling that it's *already* a virtualization. My brain interprets sense-data
and shares it with me along with the promise that this is the real real.
However I know well the texture of dreams. How inviting they are. How *real*.

*Is this the one? This world? This world the real world?*

The joy of bouldering...

Later, as we left for the long descend, Elijah wondered if perhaps the Lego
children in the Lego movie had human toys. This idea struck me as well.
Yes! I thought. Because in a world of quantized digital blocks, what could
be more wonderful than a blobby thing that splayed across it's space,
refusing to conform in any particular. This would be "A Good Toy," because
it unlocks the imagination of this Lego child in a way that nothing else
in his world could. The Joy of Failing to Fit.

* Enemies of civilization: hangboards in climbing gyms (don't get me started).
* Boon companions in time of need: the joy of finding someone else who knows knee pain that doesn't go away (long story).
* the One Thing I'm proud of: didn't succomb to Tamer's bating me to practice [throat singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zZainT9v6Q) in the wild.
