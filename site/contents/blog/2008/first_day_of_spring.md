Sunday was the first day of spring. I went for a morning ski up the Pleisenspitze,
almost 5000 feet of skiing up and down, and the views were great. In the
afternoon, Kris went out with some knitting friends and I took the boys
to Hauptbahnhof to get nacho supplies. We ate ice cream on the train platform
and watched trains come and go. Then we went to the English Garden, sat
on a hillside near the Monopteros and listened to the drummers down by
the river. We ate a butterbrezen, and enjoyed running around in t-shirts
with no jackets.

Something I really like here is that because it doesn't rain as much the
grass is usually dry. In Seattle you can't lie down on the grass until
June, it seems like! Anyway, this is one of my favorite things to do, I
can really spend hours on a picnic out there. There was some kind of improvised
swing on a tree, it looked like a set of aid climbing etriers (fabric step-ladders).
We all climbed up on it.
  
  
Just a fun day...
