A scene at the ski depot on Zischgeles.

After staying the night in Axams, I got up early and skinned up Zischgeles.
What a huge mountain! Entertaining scrambling to the summit from the ski depot.
The sun came out right at the summit, which was nice because it had been
cold, cloudy, and sometimes too windy. I took the left variant down, visiting
a hanging valley west of the normal ascent way.
