### Hike on Demeljoch
_October 5, 2008_

I hiked up from the Sylvensee just as dawn was breaking. About 400 meters up I
was surpised to be in snow. After 800 meters, it was clear my tennis shoes
wouldn't hold up to the continued half-meter of snow, so I stopped for a look
around on the scenic ridge. It looked like winter in all directions! Everything
over 1100 meters elevation or so was white. But at least there was blue sky and
warm sun. I hiked down, taking a huge spill once when a hidden root on the
trail surprised me. Got up covered in snow. Winter is here!
