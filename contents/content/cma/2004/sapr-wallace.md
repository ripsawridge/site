### Wallace Falls, April 26, 2004
I went for an evening hike/jog to the Upper Falls. It took me about
50 minutes to reach it. I enjoyed the pleasant forest trail with 
scenic views looking down to the river. The falls had a huge volume
of water. At the middle falls on the way down I looked out at the golden valley.
