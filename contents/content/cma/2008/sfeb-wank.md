### Wank
_February 14, 2008_

Some folks came to our offices from the U.S. this week and one (Tom) was an
enthusiastic hiker and skier. He was keen to somehow see the alps from Munich,
so I offered to go early in the morning up the Wank in Garmisch with him.
Surprisingly he agreed to the 5 am departure time! We had a good hike up,
carrying snowshoes needlessly because there is a good packed trail. It's
extremely icy though sometimes! We turned around about 300 feet below the
summit, because we had to return to a conference at work. Fantastic weather
though, definitely a rewarding experience.
