I hiked up the Birnhorn, having never visited the Leogang Mountains.
1800 meters up and down. I quite liked the steep trail up the south wall.
And then above the hut the trail goes through a magical cave/hole,
with wonderful scrambling on the final ascent to the summit.
I went down the normal way, which was less exciting but still
interesting. Basically, I was quite happy and enjoyed the day.
