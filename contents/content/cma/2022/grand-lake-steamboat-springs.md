First a road walk, then a beetling and nestling back
into dark and rainy forest.

My nephew Stephen drops me off in Grand Lake.

Stephen brought me out here. He had learned to ski in Steamboat Springs,
so he found it interesting that I planned to walk there from Grand Lake.
We got a beer and some appetizers, then said goodbye until next time.
I'm so glad I got to see him.

Due to a fire last year, I had to walk road up to the boundary of the Rocky
Mountain National Park. A ranger told me I wouldn't have to pay the usual 30
dollar entrance fee, since the CDT trail in the park was closed. That was nice.
My view was dominated by peaks of the Never Summer Wilderness, so named by
Native Americans in broken English in 1914 ("never no summer mountains"). It is
a good name! They held much snow, and were backdropped by dramatic dark clouds.

I had to wade across a river to get into them, cursing at wet get for the
evening, but the trail climbed slowly enough into timber beside a rushing
stream. It started to rain just as I reached campsites. I hurriedly set up my
tent beside Axel and another hiker called 70 Pound Hammer.

A trail sign talking about this section.

The rain lasted most of the night. I was happy to have a sponge to soak up
condensation on the inner wall of my tent. Still without an appetite, I ate no
dinner, which worried me because I needed to climb 6000 feet the next day (over
2000 meters).

# July 4, Day 75

In the morning, I packed up my soaking tent, and climbed to s pass with broad
views. Over the next hours, I traversed alpine basins, then descended to a
motorcycle trail in an intriguing narrow valley with lush grass and burned
trees. Here, I hung and dried my tent in the sun. This is so important. If you
don't achieve it, then the next night will be very unpleasant, because your
sleeping bag will get too wet. It's amazing how the stress disappears when
you see your tent drying out!

I crossed a road and started up a big climb to Parkview Mountain. Moving
slowly, I was impressed by the scenery despite a feeling of exhaustion caused
by a lack of calories. This summit is the highest point on the CDT remaining.
It towers over all country to the north, rolling away in green and blue waves
of remote nature preserve. The early evening light made the contours of the
land beautiful.

Similar, but zoomed in to the Never Summer Wilderness, where
storm always seemed to brew.

Getting higher on Parkview Mountain.


On the summit is a small shelter, which I had to sleep in, of course! Marmots
lived underneath, but didn't disturb me. It was quite warm inside, though I
slept poorly for some reason. I was able to eat half of my dinner tonight,
forced to bury the rest of it the next day.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04701.jpg %}
Really gorgeous country.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04703.jpg %}
More Never Summer.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04710.jpg %}
Parkview Mountain is just enormous, with vast arms at
the compass points.

The last bit to the lookout on the summit.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04715.jpg %}
Home for the night!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220704_180915_MP~2.jpg %}
Parkview Mountain never stops giving good views.
I hoped to see fireworks in the evening!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220704_192238_MP~2.jpg %}
Inside the lookout, it was warm and nice. You can see a
"Seeking Lost" sticker on the black box.

A view off to the north. I thought a person was coming,
but it was a stick or something.

# July 5, Day 76

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day76.jpg %}
From Parkview Mountain I head west, running before
a storm emerging from the Never Summer in the east.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04725.jpg %}
A last look east at sunrise.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04733.jpg %}
My way ahead...into the west!

My way leads along the ridge above, following no trail, just the border of
light and shade. Often the CDT is like this. You need to be interested in
following natural lines, because there won't always be a trail. Sometimes
footprints remind you that you have the right idea...

I was exceptionally thirsty by the time I reached the first water source of the
day, in a burned forest off to the left in the picture above. I stayed and
drank two liters. Water was becoming scarce again, like in New Mexico.

Looking back up to Parkview and the tiny summit house.

Looking back to Parkview from later in the afternoon.

An interesting rocky outcrop a bit east of Troublesome Pass.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04740.jpg %}
Upper slopes of Sheep Mountain. If you zoom in, you'll
see trusty hiker Google marching along.

I climbed up the shoulder of the mountain above, and was caught by Google, who
I hadn't seen in a while. He was traveling with Shredder and Cross Creek (from
Germany!) who were somewhere behind. Storm clouds were chasing me from the
east, and finally caught me on the other side of this peak.

I made camp in the next valley along with Google. If had only been a fifteen
miles day, but I preferred stopping early to setting up camp in the rain!
By the time the tent was set up, rain was coming down steadily, and continued
all night long.

The storm chased me all day...

# July 6, Day 77

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day77.jpg %}
I reach Muddy Pass and a bus to Steamboat after a long
day of hiking.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04745.jpg %}
Misty clouds in the forest -- a first on the CDT!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04749.jpg %}
The beautiful columbine flower, seen often on Poison
Ridge and sections further west.

Something good about all the rain, were the many flowers, like this columbine,
which is the state flower of Colorado.

The next day, the rain stopped around 6 in the morning, so i hurriedly packed in case it
started again. I climbed up to a ridge line and saw banks of fog gliding amid
the trees. For miles I followed the ridge gently down, finally coming to a road
and parking lot where sun breaks allowed me to dry the tent. Yess!!!

Lower, I met trail angel Jim, who gives milk, cookies and cold water to hikers
along this stretch from his remote camp on the road. He said he once saw an
enormous columbine flower. He went back to get his camera in a storm, but by
the time he returned, it had been destroyed!

Jim, the trail angel.

Miles of lonely country on the north side of the Rabbit
Ears Range.

Jim has been helping hikers here for six years in a row. He exudes the quiet
joy of being helpful and noticing things in nature.

Again, a storm was chasing me. I walked briskly west, eventually talking a
short cut across a field to save two miles, but paying for it with a hip deep
River crossing! After this, I walked highway eight miles southwest to Muddy
Pass. The ranching country was lonely and interesting. I had a conversation
with a guy and his wife in a truck, but saw no one else.

Once at Muddy Pass, I tried to hitch to Steamboat, but no one stopped.
However a bus came, thank goodness, and brought me to
town, where I booked two nights at the Nordic Lodge. Inflation is very real. I
never thought I'd pay $189 per night for a motel room! But the owners are very
nice, and loaned mea swimsuit for the hot tub, which I enjoyed. It had
been a 27 mile day. I was only able to get so many miles because there was
a lot of downhill and flat country.

My short cut to the highway.

After the river ford, I was soaked, but happy to
be on the highway.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04754.jpg %}
It is a *very* long walk to Muddy Pass.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04758.jpg %}
Easy miles...
