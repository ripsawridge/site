### To the Kellerjoch端tte
_August 27, 2021_

Two weeks post surgery, why not try a bigger hike? I decided to more or less repeat my hike
to the [Kellerjoch from July](/cma/2021/kellerjoch.html), and see if I'd still suffer the next
day lying in bed because I couldn't walk! Also, I might be able to use less lift support for the
way down.

Today the weather was poor, but at least it wasn't raining. I hiked up under the lift, then took
the side trail to the Geolsalm, passing a crowd of folks who thought they were the only ones
crazy enough to be out in bad weather. They admired the umbrella on my pack.

Here I'm walking up and making a little video. The camera kindly records a screen shot along the way.

First view of the Gartalm, and you can barely see the house of the Kellerjochh端tte on the skyline.

Looking towards Innsbruck from the Kellerjochh端tte.

At the hut, I ate a delicious vegan soup, the Kellerjoch-Dal (Dahl), with lentils, corn, tomatoes,
all kinds of stuff. Extremely good! I skipped the summit, instead taking the steep little side
trail that connects to the way to the Spieljoch on the north side of the Kellerjoch. From this
point, it rained on and off, and I alternately used my umbrella and stored it between my back
and the pack. My foot felt good enough to walk down to the middle-station. About 1700 meters up
and 1000 meters down.
