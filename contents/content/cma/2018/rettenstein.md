Barbara and I finally fulfilled a long-time dream to hike up the Rettenstein
together. Her grandfather had been up here many many years before, and she
always wanted to go. So did I, as it's an impressive mountain!

We started early, and followed the sometimes-faint Hirzegg Jagersteig to
the Hirzegalm (1553 m). We got some coffee here, let little Mara rest a
bit, then continued on to the beautiful and striking ridge between the
Spießnägel and the Schöntaljoch (2029 m). This was a gorgeous walk!

After a short rest at the Schöntaljoch, we descended a bit to some rocks
at the start of the steep trail up to the summit. Then it was relentlessly steep
all the way to the summit (2366 m). It was kinda fun lifting up Mara now and
then...or carefully guarding her as she negotiated rocks on the leash. By the
end I was pretty proud of myself.

Yes. I'm just walking the dog.


We went down by the Schöntalalm, then the Sonnwendalm. It was a full and
wonderful day! About 1400 meters up and down for us three.
