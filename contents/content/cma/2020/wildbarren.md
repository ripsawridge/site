Post accident, I'm starting to feel like it's possible to hike for a bit. This time I made it rather
too easy on us! By driving up to near the Bichlersee, about half of the elevation gain involved in
hiking up Wildbarren can be avoided. Well! Next time I'll park about 200 vertical meters lower on this
side road so that I get a proper 700+ meter hike.

Barbara and I happy to be on the trail.

Barbara on the summit.

A steep road at the start of our hike nearly discouraged Barbara. The sense of "endless road" provoked
by looking up at the twisted, tilted roadbed was really something. However, after 15-20 minutes we
were on a trail, and there the steepness was welcome and exciting. Funny how that works!

She found a great "Instagram" picture point.

And good for me too! Michael: the sun element! :)

This amazing little rock plug on the way down.

One day I've got to hike over to that little peak.

I'm enjoying the limestone, too.

It's not easy, being a bit of an old man on the trail going down. I have an especially hard time where
bits of snow, ice and mud combine. Because I'm very careful with my foot, I can't abide unexpected moves.
Therefore, my security precautions on sketchy steps are rather elaborate. Once I even crawled backwards
down a slope to avoid the mere chance of slipping. So it goes!

Off-trail travel, which we had for about 15 minutes is especially hard because of the tilt of the ankle
without a trailbed. Also rocks under grass require surprising angles. But I'm learning and trying to get stronger.
I see this as completely necessary. I'm wondering what snowshoeing and skiing will be like.

Mara stalks farm cats, dodging through the ponies!

We had a great time. I won't try and recount our many conversations, plans for the future, etc. They make
a wonderful way to spend a day together.
