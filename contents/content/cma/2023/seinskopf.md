Really nice hike up the Seinskopf. I tried this hike a few years ago but
got a terrible headache on the way up and returned sadly home after climbing
up most of the steep forested ridge to the high country.

This time was better. From the Seinskopf, I stayed on the ridge crest to the
Schafskehre, then by the summit of the Feldernkreuz before navigating some
snow to get to the Schöttelkarspitze summit, which was busy with people coming
from the Soiernhaus area. The snowy north face of the Soiernspitze looked
quite impressive.

Looking across to the Soiernspitze.

On the way down, I followed the traversing trail on the side of the ridge
between the Seinskopf and the Schafskehre, then descended to the north on
a trail that a sign down at the Felsenhüttl told me is called the Herzogsteig.

I was really happy to get water in a stream near there, very thirsty! There
had been no water until this point. Continuing down, I hit a dirt road
and followed it back to where I parked. A good day out, 1550 meters up and
down.
