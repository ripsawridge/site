My
former neighbor Riki had been trying to climb up the Elmauer Halt for more
than a year, enduring bad weather, trips with folks who were scared of
heights and other woes. She enlisted me to go earlier in the summer and
finally a day arose when we could juggle busy schedules and meet up. She
drove her family's beautiful new black Nissan and we got to the trailhead
with no traffic at all. I always forget what a fast hiker Riki is, and
within 40 minutes, we were at the Gruttenhütte, advertised by trail signs
to take an hour and a half! I'd made her promise not to worry too much
about timing, but just to enjoy ourselves. (Riki and I used to only do
"dawn patrols" together, racing back to town before 10 am after hiking
or skiing). But nobody told her legs that :D.
  
  
So it wasn't much longer and we were above the hut, hiking through a boulderfield
on fresh snow, and talking about the usual parent topics of kids, kids
allowances, toys, and all that stuff only fascinating to the be-kidded
like us! It's always nice to get another perspective on the whole perplexing
thing. I told some stories about Rowan and Elijah and how different they
can be from each other.
  
  
Meanwhile, we found the trail again (I'd led us off into a wilderness
of snow and rock), then climbed more steeply to the beautiful trail that
traverses above and below cliffs almost magically to the  Rote-Rinne
Scharte ("Red Gully Pass," imaginatively named). We continued on steeper
ground, now following an iron cable to mark the way on good rock. Fresh
snow had made things a bit slippery however. We were constantly surprised
by how greasy the rock felt with our wet shoes. I would take two (_hilarious!_)
pratfalls on the descent because of this. Below the Scharte, we climbed
on loose rock rather than follow the "contrived" ladder of iron steps hammered
into the rock a few feet above the general slope. This was a fun diversion,
however, my be-velcroed camera decided to let go from my pack in here,
and say goodbye after 6 wonderful years into the red maul of the Rote-Rinne
Scharte! Goodbye camera! I...loved you!
  
  
It's time had come. I was thinking about buying a new one for a while,
and maybe now was the time. Any advice? It was a Panasonic Lumix, circa
2006 vintage.

We continued on enjoyable scrambling terrain, eventually reaching a fun
ladder. Above this, we scrambled further to the summit and enjoyed great
views in all directions. The recent snow was melting, but the great alpine
chain to the south presented a stunning sight: a broad snowline extending
along the chain showing that the mid-week snow had been quite extensive.
Would it fully melt? After all, it was only mid-September.

I tried to smoke my pipe on top, but after 5 matches in a weak wind I
gave up! Oh well. We had nice sandwiches, identified Riki's parents house
(approximately), and talked about Greece. After a good long time, we headed
down, running into dozens of people climbing up. It truly is the most popular
hike in the Wilder Kaiser. We were glad to have the mountains to ourselves
on the way up, especially because we saw herds of _gämse,_ grazing near
the boulderfields.

After my pratfall-laced descent, we went to the Gruttenhütte, having drinks,
soup and pie. It was so crowded we had to go sit on a grassy ledge away
from the hut, bedeviled only by children running around behind us. The
whole trip had a feeling of a year "summing up," and this good extra rest
on the descent reinforced that. Now we talked about jobs and all their
foibles.
  
  
Within 30 minutes we were back at the car, stopping only to buy a pumpkin
for Frederik and Heidi. I figured I'd wait until closer to Halloween to
get one.
  
  
Thanks Riki for a great hike, ca-ching, another Kaiser trip in the bank!!
(Fleischbank, that is! (this is an insider Wilder Kaiser joke (no it's
not (okay, fine)))).
