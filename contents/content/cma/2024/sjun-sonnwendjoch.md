I hiked up the Vorderes Sonnwendjoch, starting from the Grünsbach parking
lot, following a mix of road and trail. It had been raining on the highway
and the sky was cloudy, so my mood was a bit down. However, it turned out
better than I expected.

*Nice sheep near the summit.*

I stopped for a coffee at the Bayreuther-Hütte, and promised to return for
a beer, which I did later. Near the summit there were sheep, and decent
views, even if beclouded in a couple directions.

On the way down I stopped to sit in the Kniepass church. I also found that
you can go from a high road straight down along the ridge directly to the
Kniepass, on a mix of faint trail and cross-country travel. Awesome!
