I am a software engineer working on the [Google][1] [Chrome][2] [V8][3] team in Munich, Germany, generally trying
to make the system run [faster][4]. Areas of current interest are Allocation Sites, which allow us to gather
feedback for specific initialization sites in JavaScript, and [Inline Caches][5] (*wonderful article by Vyacheslav*).

This site is primarily devoted to my [longtime hobby](climbing.html) of alpine
climbing. I learned to climb in Washington State, and moved to Munich in 2006 to
explore the Alps. I enjoy the mountain activities so much that I've [obsessively
recorded them](cma/) since the very [first](cma/1997/sainthelens.html) climb in
1997.

Occasionally I write on my [blog](blog/) about music, metaphysics, politics, books, or family strolls through the
Englischer Garten. We live in [Lehel][6], a quiet neighborhood just outside the Innere Ring, and love our local
[pizzerias][7], bakery and Thursday Kuchen Markt. My wife [Kris][8] and our [two boys][9] are also active in olympic
weightlifting. She is also a master [spinner][10].
