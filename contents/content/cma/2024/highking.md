*52 images here, I must apologize but I had to include them all!*

Michael suggested the Watzmann Traverse for the weekend, which seemed like
a good idea. But as the weekend approached, we both got serious cases
of FOMO (fear of missing out!) and began arguing for more ambitious plans.
The Grossglockner, or the Hochkönig, or how about the Wieder Route and
how about a half-dozen different bivouac ideas? Finally the Hochkönig
came out on top as a kind of moderate goal between something too hard and
something too easy. The Franzlweg offered climbing to V+, while also
requiring boots and crampons. The "too hard" feeling was entirely on my
side, I must confess...I'm in winter hibernation-mode already!

At the last minute, I tossed my rock shoes in my pack. We had food for
the night and breakfast. Michael brought a sleeping bag, but I was gambling
that there would be enough blankets in the winter room...

On the way up we admired the mountain and talked of many things, too many
to list here! But the overall theme was about finding a middle way towards
living a good and productive life, between the rocks and rapids of many
competing belief systems. We strive towards turth, while admitting that
we are deceived and deceive ourselves daily. Our beliefs easily harden
into ideologies that support and enchain us. How do you possibly grow
old gracefully, remaining changeable like fire inside, while also
becoming useful to others by serving them as roads and bridges they can
rely on?

The key to growing old may be to remain young, though not the "young" the
world holds dear...a different kind of young, made of strong and flexible
material, though no longer ravaged by desire. How to do this?

Stay in the present. Be open-ended, to use Michael's phrase. Laugh at yourself
at every chance, because it washes away arthritic structure ever building
in this mind that overvalues itself.

*Michi climbs*

We talked about the moon, and wondered if it has it's own light. Or I should
say, *her* own light, for if the sun is a he, the moon must be a she...we
recognize this in an instant. But if we declare that *her* light must
express itself physically, then we build up costly side-effects. We'll be
forced to regard the astronomers and scientists as liars, and our world
darkens more than it must. On the other hand, if we discard this beautiful
idea completely, we calcify into machine-man, in whom nothing of youth is
preserved.

"How about if she bathes us in her light, and yet her light is *his* light,
reflected and changed in and through her, such that it is truly she who
graces us?" I wondered.

Maybe we can hold spiritual truth in this way. We give everyone respect,
and learn from them all. The scientist brings us his diagrams, with sin and
cosine and tangents, and we nod. The aboriginal man focuses on the moon and
forgets the sun, and declares that her light is her own. We nod at this too.
We do not need enemies. Yes, I know they are there. But now I am lost in
the beauty of the moon, and in a dream of how the light from our Father
becomes the light of each man, woman and child. And moon.

And...with these thoughts we reached the end of the trail, and scrabbled
across broken boulders and a crisp, cold snowfield with a single set of
old tracks, aiming for a light-grey cascade of rock bubbling from the
face above. We hunted for the red dot which marks the start of the route,
and found it right where we expected it to be.

We climbed in parallel for a while, useful when we aren't sure how solid
the rock is. By the absence of sound, we knew safety, and the way narrowed,
me usually right behind. Stemming between gnarled knuckles of dark gray
rock, we followed a ledge up and right to a vertical step that marked
the first real climbing move. This is the beginning of pitch 7 on our
topo of the route. Michael checked the holds, and hoisted himself up.
All good. Now 5 more pitches in a narrowing chimney before the ground
opened up again to a high, tilted plane.

"Nice!" We either got philosophical or just said ordinary things about
how good the sun felt and how glad we were the wind was content to
murmur softly instead of scream.

We'd reached the *dunkler Pfeiler* (dark buttress) marked on the topo, and
hiked up along its base to reach a small *Kessel* with steep walls, only
one of which looked climbable. We got out the rope, and Michael led up.
We only had 30 meters, and expected to make short pitches until things got
easier again.

Michael went up, clipped a bolt and tried to figure out the move. He moved
left of the bolt, placed a foot high up on the opposite wall, and delicately
stemmed until he could get hands under an overhanging flake of rock, then
commit to the face and move up out of sight. I came up, leading a short
pitch with a slung chockstone for protection, then Michael went forward
again to a belay right below a grade 4- vertical step. We were in the
shade now and getting cold. Michael got a jacket on, and I climbed right
above him for the step. It was great fun, with perfect handholds and a few
small, ledgy footholds that my boots edged perfectly on. I belayed just
below the exit to a grassy terrace. We hurried up to it because we
really wanted the sun again!

Apparently, a lot of hard routes on the vertical *Südwand* begin on the
other side of this terrace -- that's quite an approach! We'd been climbing
about 3 hours to this point.

The scenery was immense here, and the sun was very welcome. But the terrain
is sometimes loose and unpleasant. At one point we climbed light, slabby,
hollow-feeling rock that seemed like it might break suddenly. The ground
flattened a bit, and we stopped to eat and drink. "At least the pack will
be lighter!" We were roped up with about 10 meters of rope in between,
sometimes carried in coils.

Above the lunch place, we climbed some *Wasserrillen* (vertical channels
carved into the rock by water), then reached a ridge crest at the base
of an impossible-looking wall. After a short snow-traverse, Michael was
leading up a vertical step, then disappeared out of sight above. A few
minutes later, I followed up through a chimney and cracks with an old
fixed rope hanging down part of it. I wonder why?

I'd switched to rock shoes at the previous belay, and now I was glad for
it! I had a tough time getting started on the next pitch, a mantel move
felt very dicey to reach a little bathtub right of the belay. Above this,
I climbed a shallow crack in a slabby face. There was always a hold where
I needed one, but just barely! This pitch had 2 bolts and a piton for
protection, and I was glad they were there. Also for my rock shoes!

I set a belay at the base of the crux of the climb -- a stemming problem
in a large, rounded runnel. It looked like a giant had used an ice-cream
scoop to peel out a layer of rock. There is a single bolt pretty high up
in the move -- unless you are quite tall, just reaching the bolt is
committing. As I stemmed up on indistinct nubbins on the walls of the
"scoop," I was again *glad for my rock shoes!* I was able to get a foot
high on the left side, because there seemed to be an indentation for my
hands to get some purchase over there, then pushing off of that, I reached
some good holds up and left of the bolt. Whew! I exited to the right into
a little anteroom of sorts with a bolt to set a belay. Also in the
"room" was a pile of loose rocks ready to fall down on anyone who tries to
avoid the crux move via a crack on the right. As a climber sadly named
"*Inaktiver Benutzer*" said on [bergsteigen.com](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/franzlweg-jubilaeumsweg-hochkoenig/):

> *Wenn der Vorsteiger weiter oben die 5+ nach rechts umgeht, hagelt's Brocken. Also Obacht!*
> [translated: if the leader avoids the 5+ crux by going right, it will
> hail stones. So beware!]

Michael came up, having enjoyed the short but interesting pitch a lot.
And so, we were done with pitch 26! Haha, not that I'm counting...

We left our shady anteroom and came back out into the sun, but it was much
weaker now, beaten down by a thickening of clouds, like unpleasant relatives
gathering after a death. We soon saw the trail crossing over from the
Königsjodler *Klettersteig* to the Matras-haus, but Michael warned against
losing our honor by wandering over to it instead of remaining on route to
our West Summit! He is right! So we turned back to the rock for more climbing.
Right at the end there was a pretty tough 3+ section on *Wasserrillen*, and
I asked Michael for a belay. I was back in my clunky boots and it felt very
insecure. But now we were on top!

We took pictures in the waning light, then walked down and up to a higher
summit. Coming down from this one brought us to hard, icy snow on the
track over to the Matras-Haus. I stopped to put on crampons, but Michael
didn't need them. I would be amazed several times at his ability on
ice without *steigeisen*.

He continued on the ridge crest, and I followed the snow track. We met on
top just as the sunset was most beautiful. Michael had news: "The hut owner is
here and we can sit in the main room for dinner and have a beer!"

Fantastic!

We took about 3 gigabytes of photos, and talked a bit with the other people
out here. As it turned out, the winterroom was actually filled up!
The owner kindly let 2 people sleep in the house, making room for Michael
and I to each get a narrow bunk. For a while I thought we'd just have to
descend in the dark. We went into the winterroom and a man was perched
in the middle of the bunks. He told us we were out of luck -- no beds. He
said maybe it would be possible to sleep outside...

We had a great dinner of pasta with vegetables and cheese. I irritated the
hut owner by trying to use the bathroom in the house. He had explained
that they can't be used but I wasn't listening. I guess he came up and
gave a lecture to the dining room while I was away because I returned and
everyone stared at me. Such is life!

But indeed, we got a beer, and enjoyed a few hours up there while the owner
tested and repaired an array of electric or butane heaters on the floor.
This made the room really warm, which was great.

After a lot of dessert and snacks, we headed down for bed. I piled four
blankets on myself -- they are much less efficient than a sleeping bag, so
you need volume! Michael had a light sleeping bag. So we settled in for 8
or 9 hours of rest. It was indeed a long night, but there isn't much else
you can do at this time of year. I fell asleep to a cavalcade of voices
whispering in German, Russian and other Slovene languages...

## Day Two

Up and out for the sunrise!

I guess all of us in the winter room were sun-worshippers. Everyone had
their camera at the ready. After this, I packed up pretty quickly, eager
to get warm. I started down ahead of Michael, and we agreed to meet
at the entrance to the Birgkar. We might go over and hike up another
summit, or might just head down.

Crunching down the frozen slopes, I enjoyed myself. Today was Michael's
birthday...somehow I'd only remember that when I was alone and always
forget to congratulate him! I hope the climb and the sunset and sunrise
were a good present. I waited at a sunny spot, and he arrived soon
after, making his way across snow slopes. Pretty soon he had the stove
going and prepared tea and oatmeal, with fresh berry jam from his mom.
Outstanding...a long breakfast at a scenic place.

The trip down was tricky, especially in the upper third. There were several
places where the tread seemed to have been washed away by rain earlier
in the summer. Happily the most dangerous spots had some kind of cable
to hold on to. We saw a few hardy climbers on the Königsjodler above us.
Excellent...

Lower down, I put crampons on to descent a snowy gully while Michael continued
on trail to the right. "It was *terrible*," he said. Indeed, two guys
had tried going up it to a junction on the Königsjodler ridge, but turned
around after they were reduced to crawling upwards a while on insecure
ball-bearings over a frozen dirt layer. I was lucky, because descending
the snow turned out to be fun and easy, too.

We met up at the point we'd left the trail the day before for the climb,
and bombed down, stopping a couple of times to rest and take pictures.
It really did take hours to reach trail. We didn't mind at all that
we'd decided to take a "rest" day, and reached the car around 14:00.

The drive back was fun because we could see many mountains and routes,
and there was no traffic. A big thanks to Michael and to the "High King,"
and don't let me forget Herr Franzl who put in the bolts for this
interesting route!
