Barbara and I hiked up Karkopf, because the Lamprechtfels rocks were just too cold to climb!
We got above the clouds on the summit and enjoyed time with some friendly dogs.
Later, we went back to climb "Kinderspiel" (IV+), and although I got up with frozen fingers,
Barbara had no interest after her feet kept slipping on icy, muddy holds!

Oh, a man recognized us from the Br√ºnnstein hike 4 weeks before. Very interesting!

Above the clouds felt so good.

Cold in the forest...too cold to climb!
