A great hike up Wildbarren. Because of construction on the road at our preferred
parking space, we decided to take the north route, which follows the road
a long ways until able to gain the north ridge of the peak.

On the way down, we ran into a sign saying the way is closed for coming out
to the north. We had to traverse an electric fenceline for at least a kilometer.
Very strange...
