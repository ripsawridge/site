Patrick and I had promised to find time and go hiking in the fall, and our
chance finally arose. The weather was grim through most of September
(apparently the wettest in 10 years), so I hoped that an east-side destination
would provide rain-free hiking. Patrick correctly predicted general clearing, 
and when this happened even on the west side of the crest I was amazed 
(perhaps a little "crestfallen" too, considering the long drive past Roslyn 
and such places!). The hike is straightforward, although we managed to lose
the trail right at the start! "This <i>can't</i> be it, right?" Finding the
trail again, we set off at a brisk pace, and reached the pass to great
views of Mt. Daniel being slowly engulfed by cloud.

Deciding the hike was too
short for us, we scrambled up the first peak on the ridge to the south.
A foreboding mine shaft gave me the shivers - you couldn't see the bottom
beyond a latticework of rotten timbers half-suspended in the shaft. After
a quick lesson in rock climbing, we wandered higher, finding an intriguing
ledge system on the east side of the ridge with overhangs beetling above.
We finally turned around shy of the summit after I started climbing 5th
class terrain and thought better of it (Patrick was wisely dubious of the
finger traverse where a section of ledge had crumbled away!).

After a visit to a nearby lake, we started pack, a bit startled by a party
led by a visionary figure with long flowing locks of gray hair, and a hoarse
voice excitedly describing "The Cradle" to the east. Had we seen Harvey
Manning? On the way down we continued fun conversation about China, France,
pedagogy, and sports cars. Looking forward to next time!
