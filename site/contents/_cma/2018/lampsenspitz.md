## Lampsenspitz

It turns out I really enjoy winter these days! Lots of snowshoeing and skiing,
and today just continues the trend. I skinned up from the parking lot in
Praxmar in a murky cloud that I figured would be with me the whole day.
However, within an hour I was seeing hints of blue sky above, and soon I
was in bright sunshine!

My skis had a hard time gripping the skin track, but it was really just
my poor technique. When I remembered to keep my steps small and to
shift weight fully to the standing leg, things went better. There was
one guy above me, here you can see him:

Later we met on the summit -- a fellow Münchner!

I'm currently reading "[Man Swarm: How Overpopulation is Killing the Wild
World](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Swarm-Overpopulation-Killing-World-ebook/dp/B00SHUL9T6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518282083&sr=1-1&keywords=man+swarm)," and it's heavy stuff. It's very difficult to talk about the problem
of overpopulation, but it's deeply necessary. It's a problem in the first world,
where our resource use per capita is really high, and in the developing
world, where large numbers of people drive deforestation just at a time
when we need to keep our last big forests.

I've got two children, so I realize I'm part of the problem. And my boys
are learning about the problem too. We don't merely need to stabilize the
population, we need negative population growth. Lately, we talk a lot about
carbon emissions, and are faced with the difficult task of driving them down.
The problem is that by the [inexorable logic of exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZA9Hnp3aV4), greater 
numbers of people will crash through those lower per-capita emissions we
may achieve with technological fixes, and bring the total up again by
their numbers.

Argh...it is a hard problem! And it goes completely against what our economists
preach (they are really the priests of our civilization). They often argue
that we can substitute one thing for another endlessly, but there is something
special about clean water, air and space for the natural world.

You can't find a substitute for those.

Here, there is enough space...

I'd like everybody to be able to have space.


So, on my solitary way up the mountain I thought about this stuff. It's not
too late...! But it's pretty late. :)

However on the way down, S., my new friend from the summit and I skied together
and had a great time. We were separated for a while by the thickest fog I'd
ever tried to ski in. It was ridiculous! I couldn't even see my ski tips...
and making a turn was a real "heart-in-throat" exercise wondering why I
was suddenly accelerating down at an unexpected angle. After 5-10 awkward
minutes we were through, and were very relieved to be able to see again.

The rest of the way was fun, and too quickly finished, as usual! I led us boldly
down a steep forest that I slightly regretted, my skiing skills not really being
up to the task! But it's all good.

1200 meters up/down.

## Hoher Seeblaskogel

The next day, with skis freshly waxed at the shop by the hotel, I drove back
to Lüsens, parked and started skinning up for either the Hoher Seeblaskogel or
the Längentaler Weißer Kogel, I wasn't sure which I would do. But about halfway
up the valley, my skin came off the ski. And the bail at the top was broken.
ARGH! Now the skin was covered in snow, and there was no way I could get it to
stick to the ski. Cue sound of crying!

But luckily, I had snowshoes in the car. I was thinking Barbara might join me
for some snowshoeing, but she had no "Lust" for it (it cracks me up how
some words in German have a different meaning in english...). So, I skied
quickly back and changed out my gear in a hurry. I stomped back up the road
in snowshoes...they made such a loud noise that at least three parties gave
me odd or dirty looks. "Entschuldigung für Geräusche!" I would say.
No one ever replied, they just looked away. In general, I didn't experience
friendly people today, at least until the end.

Whatever. I passed by the icefall, then turned right and started up under the
_Sessellift_ taking supplies to the Westfalenhaus. In the upper valley the
wind was strong, and the tantalizing blue sky disappeared, never to be seen
again. My tracks were soon filled in with blowing snow. I vaguely followed a
duo on skis ahead of me, with another solitary skier above them. Later, the
skier in front turned right for the Hoher Seeblaskogel and I decided that was
the mountain for me. I was thinking about the long, long walk down without the
benefit of skis! The Hoher Seeblaskogel is steeper, and that makes it quicker
to get down when walking.

Occasionally, I could benefit from old ski tracks, but it was always only by
feel. Especially as the slope steepened, I'd sink deep into wind-pressed pack.
Slight sign on the surface of the snow would lure me to one side or the other,
and with my boots I'd feel humps and ramps that were remnant tracks. Mostly,
they angled low, left and right across my direct way. But sometimes I was
beaten down enough by the bottomless wind-pack to try following them. It was
never worthwhile -- a thin skin-track at low angle across the slope is merely
demoralizing on snowshoes. Too often, the wind-driven snow on top is slippery,
and you slide beneath the track, especially with the outside foot. So always,
back to the grind of direct ascent.

Truly, I aged a few years in the journey from the valley floor to the lower edge of
the gully that cradles the Grüne Tatzen Ferner. I stopped for tea above this point
and took a bleak picture that reflected my bleak, worn-out state of mind! 

The going was easier up here, much less steep. And soon I was traversing the left side
of the bowl that (I guess) holds the remnant glacier. I was startled to see a party of
5 up in here, and another party of 3. What had they been doing the whole time?
Anyway, they left. A young man and woman were climbing up behind me on skis, but I
thought I had a big lead on them.

However, the final slope below the summit was pretty rough. Deep wind-pack over a
slippery, slidy base. It felt like two steps forward, one back many times. Finally
I moved off the main slope to the ridge crest, though with some worry about
cornices. This was a little better. Though, as I grunted and groaned my way up the
pair behind caught me, skinning gracefully like Elves in humorous contrast to my bulldog
performance. Yep.

I tagged the summit in light snowfall and strong wind, took a listless picture and
started down, just missing the couple, as I descended a different way from the
summit cross.

Without snowshoes, I plunge-stepped quickly down...snow up to my hips, but how nice it
felt to descend! I used snowshoes to traverse the glacier, then removed them again
for the steep descent to the valley floor. Just the sound of my breathing, the 
gray and murky peaks, the snowfall and my warm core.

The couple caught me and stopped to chat. I told my woeful story of the
morning.  They were sympathetic, but couldn't imagine why I'd rather just go
ahead and climb with snowshoes rather than come back another day with better
equipment.

"Can't waste a day, folks!" I said, or something like that.

Can't waste a day.

1700 meters up/down.
