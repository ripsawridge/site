I'm changing my life in a big way in the new year -- leaving the safe job,
embarking on a multi-month hike, either in Europe or the USA. Everything is
is in the air. It's been interesting to see my reactions to things. I set
all this in motion, but there is a tendency to get annoyed with one aspect
or another. I've caught myself fantasizing about arguments and show-downs.
For example, I've read that flight attendents throw people off planes if
their mask is down a second too long while putting a chip into their mouth.
I'm jogging one day, and find I've spent the last five minutes with a
scenario where this happens to me, I end up stranded in Iceland with a
40 thousand dollar bill for an unscheduled airplane stop. No one cares,
injustice is maximized. Tears of recrimination, hurt, Twitter flame wars...

*What is happening?* And then I see.

My ego fears the unknown and doesn't know how to control what approaches.
It is trying out scenarios in which it prevails against enormous odds.
When it faces emptiness, it can only fill it with war.

And so it is that I would step into a New World, and find it essentially the
same as the Old. The walls have already been painted by that which lurks
within...which lives by my assent. That which I cannot entirely disavow,
ever. My protector...and my destroyer.

Here, I must be the adult. For each withdrawal from the bank of the future
it makes with the energy of my consciousness, I must put double the amount
back in -- in visions of hearty adventures, of struggle overcome...of
friendship, of summits. Of love. Of nights of cold stars, and fierce warmth
within.

This I will do.

The first stop on my path is to reach out to Tamara and see what her friends
and high countanences on the astral plane have to say. My specific question
was: "should I pursue the more ambitious hike in the USA?"

## The First Row

Tamara draws 6 cards, laying them out as the first of 4 rows. Subsequent
rows normally enlarge on the idea presented in the first row. The first
row came from her **Archangel Michael** cards. The first card was:

**Go Forward Fearlessly**

What a message! The angel sits on a throne, holding a sun-like orb. He
occupies the beautiful center of Tiphareth, the highest center we can
ascend to as men. This is the place of beauty, imagination and justice.
The prayer beneath is one of gratitude to the Great Benefactor. It is
the psychological location that brings tears of joy to my eyes easily,
and fills my legs with the desire to walk across a golden land.

My name is Michael, and a Higher Michael tells me to walk. So I see it,
so may it be.

**Shield Yourself** is the next card. Tamara talked about holes in the
penumbra of white light around me. I think that this is what I'm doing
to myself -- out of fear that a glorious future may disappoint, I'm
tearing it down already. Doubts are, I think, "holes" on a higher
plane. Remember the "ozone layer hole?" It makes perfect sense to
me that it came in the 1970s, when we became newly conscious of our
role as stewards of creation...and began to doubt that we were doing
so very well. The answer here must be to continue and increase
positive signal radiating from the core. A strong offense is the best
defence, methinks.

**Spend more time outdoors** is next. Well...yes. I almost feel like this
was a small joke. I mean...how could I not? :)

**Self respect**. This theme was continually enlarged in subsequent rows.
I spent most of my life as a "people pleaser," and it's been hard to unlearn.
I still find myself agreeing to things that are not the best for me. At least
now I return to the people, hat in hand, and beg off. Easily saying no
to things that dilute concentration of my energy is my task.

**Detach from the situation** is necessary advice. I often feel in a
small, cramped room with two hairy problems: the permits for the hike and
my ability to walk long flat distances. It's easy to get desperate. The truth
is, whatever happens, it will be 100% okay, and I'll learn throughout.
I have a big goal, and a big goal is one that you don't know for sure that
you can complete. There is uncertainty. To take that ride...the ride of a
big goal, you must be "tall enough" to detach from fear. To detach from
dependence on outcome. All outcomes are flowers in the Lords garden.
The important thing is to be in the Lords garden! Not to crush one flower
out of that all-too-human admixture of fear and love of self.

**Focus upon divine and perfect health**. And so ends the top row -- the
conditioner of all that comes below. Here is good advice. Here I'll channel
Neville Goddard and deny the trickster evidence of my senses. I will form
the future with my own "hands." With my imagination, which is the spark of
Christ given into my care. This I can do, because this I *have done*.

## Second Row

**Play** is the first card. That I can do.

**Time to Go** is the second, with an angel flying rapidly across the frame.
"He who hesitates is lost," comes to mind. I've carved out space in life
for this hike...perhaps the angel is right. There may not be a better time.

**Reward yourself**.
