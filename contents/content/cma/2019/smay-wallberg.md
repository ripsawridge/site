### Wallberg

_May 26, 2019_

I made a quick hike up Wallberg in the evening. I never saw the area looking so beautiful.
The late-lying snow is pretty impressive when combined with rich green of late spring,
and the evening sun lent a golden cast to every element in the environment -- making even
the outbuildings of the upper lift station romantic.
