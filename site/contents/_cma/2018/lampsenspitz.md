It turns out I really enjoy winter these days! Lots of snowshoeing and skiing,
and today just continues the trend. I skinned up from the parking lot in
Praxmar in a murky cloud that I figured would be with me the whole day.
However, within an hour I was seeing hints of blue sky above, and soon I
was in bright sunshine!

My skis had a hard time gripping the skin track, but it was really just
my poor technique. When I remembered to keep my steps small and to
shift weight fully to the standing leg, things went better. There was
one guy above me, here you can see him:

Later we met on the summit -- a fellow MÃ¼nchner!

I'm currently reading "[Man Swarm: How Overpopulation is Killing the Wild
World](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Swarm-Overpopulation-Killing-World-ebook/dp/B00SHUL9T6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518282083&sr=1-1&keywords=man+swarm)," and it's heavy stuff. It's very difficult to talk about the problem
of overpopulation, but it's deeply necessary. It's a problem in the first world,
where our resource use per capita is really high, and in the developing
world, where large numbers of people drive deforestation just at a time
when we need to keep our last big forests.

I've got two children, so I realize I'm part of the problem. And my boys
are learning about the problem too. We don't merely need to stabilize the
population, we need negative population growth. Lately, we talk a lot about
carbon emissions, and are faced with the difficult task of driving them down.
The problem is that by the [inexorable logic of exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZA9Hnp3aV4), greater 
numbers of people will crash through those lower per-capita emissions we
may achieve with technological fixes, and bring the total up again by
their numbers.

Argh...it is a hard problem! And it goes completely against what our economists
preach (they are really the priests of our civilization). They often argue
that we can substitute one thing for another endlessly, but there is something
special about clean water, air and space for the natural world.

You can't find a substitute for those.

Here, there is enough space...

I'd like everybody to be able to have space.

So, on my solitary way up the mountain I thought about this stuff. It's not
too late...! But it's pretty late. :)

However on the way down, S., my new friend from the summit and I skied together
and had a great time. We were separated for a while by the thickest fog I'd
ever tried to ski in. It was ridiculous! I couldn't even see my ski tips...
and making a turn was a real "heart-in-throat" exercise wondering why I
was suddenly accelerating down at an unexpected angle. After 5-10 awkward
minutes we were through, and were very relieved to be able to see again.

The rest of the way was fun, and too quickly finished, as usual! I led us boldly
down a steep forest that I slightly regretted, my skiing skills not really being
up to the task! But it's all good.

1200 meters up/down.
