I had an idea this morning during meditation (always a bad idea), so to
get rid of it I wrote it down. Then I thought I'd try and present it
artistically so I put a fresh ribben in my 1971 Hermes Baby typewriter
and wrote it up!

It occurred to me later, reading over it, that after saying the climber
will give up his life, I'd like to pencil in by hand the thought that
it wasn't his life after all, it was always a gift from the Father,
and can only be returned with the same attitude with which it was
accepted: gratitude and joy.

*Special thanks to our family friend Fouad who inspired me to think
on these things!*
