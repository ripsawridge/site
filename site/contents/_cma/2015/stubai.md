I decided to try and repeat my long multi-day in one day hike in
the Stubaier HÃ¶henweg from that cold summer day in 2006.
However, I had some new shoes and they became very painful somewhere
along the way. I was also carrying a somber burden, and life
was about to change catastrophically. Maybe that had something to
do with it, too.

The mountains were wonderful, but I think I could only half-hear them.
