### Morning hike up Ettaler Manndl
_April 7, 2007_

I hiked up the Ettaler Manndl, and the Laberjoch (just a ski lift and restaurant there, not very exciting). For the Manndl, I took an easy rock climbing way, about 1.5 pitches called the Weiblkante. Good fun!

The route marked in green on the left is the Weiblkante (IV). The red route on
the right is a marked variant, rated UIAA VII. The blue dots mark bolts.
