From the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/world/middleeast/23jerusalem.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin) today:
  
  
... At the recent talk and discussion session, one man stood and said
Mr. Manekin and his friends were hurting Israel, especially its image abroad,
in order to salve their own consciences. Many in the audience nodded in
agreement. Tall and dignified, about 45, the man said that he, too, had
served in the West Bank, "and I'm proud of what I did there to defend Israelis."
  
  
It is crucial to intimidate people at checkpoints to keep them cowed,
he said, his voice shaking a little, "because we are so few there, and
they are so many."
  
  
Then he said: "These people are not like us! They come up to our faces
and they lie to us!"
  
  
That was enough for Uriel Simon, 77 years old, a professor emeritus of
biblical studies at Bar-Ilan University and a noted religious dove.
  
  
"As for liars," Mr. Simon said, then paused. "My father was a liar. My
grandfather was a liar. How else did we cross lines to get to this country?
We stayed alive by lying. We lied to the Russians, we lied to the Germans,
we lied to the British! We lie for survival! Jacob the Liar was my father!"
he said.
  
  
As for the Palestinians, he said: "Of course they lie! Everyone lies at
a checkpoint! We lied at checkpoints, too." ...
