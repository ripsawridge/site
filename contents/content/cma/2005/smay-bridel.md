### Bridel Veil Falls, May 7, 2005

Carlos and I took the boys for a hike. The babies were very good, just
complaining when the harness straps chafed their neck. We had hoped to go
all the way to Lake Serene, but after thinking about the total time, and
how much milk I had brought, it seemed prudent to just go to the upper falls
lookout instead (we also visited the lower falls). Unfortunately, things
went poorly here: the milk had de-homogenized radically in the chilly, damp
air, and was not fit for drinking. Then, Elijah started shivering! Oh man,
I felt terrible. Carlos was doing a great job keeping Rowan comfortable,
but I was keen to hurry home and let them have some proper milk. Also Elijah
needed to be warmed up in the "Baby Bjorn." The babies were quiet until we
got near Duvall, then the hunger made them cry the rest of the way home.
I learned a few painful lessons today! Big thanks to Carlos for coming along,
he'll be a great dad one day.
