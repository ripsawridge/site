## About me
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/portrait2.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm a software engineer working on the <a href="http://www.google.com/en">Google</a> 
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chrome</a> 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> team in Munich, Germany, 
generally trying to make the system
run <a href="http://arewefastyet.com/">faster</a>. 
Areas of current interest are the TurboFan optimizing compiler, and 
<a href="http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html">Inline Caches</a>                    
 (*wonderful article by Vyacheslav*).

This site is primarily devoted to 
my longtime hobby of alpine climbing.
I learned to climb in Washington State, and moved to Munich in 2006 to explore the Alps. 
I enjoy the mountain activities so much that Iâ€™ve obsessively recorded them since the 
very first climb in 1997.

Occasionally I write about music, metaphysics, politics, books, or strolls through the
Englischer Garten. I've got amazing family and friends, and one very special lady, Barbara.
