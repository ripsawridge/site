### Hochplatte hike
_September 17, 2006_

Daniel could go for a quick hike Sunday morning. We left Munich around 6:20 and
drove to the Ammergau alps, just near the Austrian border. We thought it would
be rainy, but above low clouds we could see the peaks in sunshine - yes!! We
had a great time hiking up, talking about Seattle, politics and all kinds of
things. Shortly after reaching the ridge crest, we were in sunshine, with a
dramatic "cloud sea" below us. We followed a neat narrow ridge to the summit of
Hochplatte, then descended to climb another summit (Kr√§he) on the same ridge.
Geiselstein was peeking out of the clouds from time to time. That summit has
some great multipitch rock climbs that I can't wait to visit.

As we came down from the ridges to a pass where we'd turn back to the south in
order to loop back to our car, we saw our first people of the day. A large and
friendly group. They immediately offered us a drink of schnapps from their
flask. I couldn't turn them down of course! I believe it was Williams (Grappa).
With a hearty thanks, we jogged and walked down to the car, and had a good
plate of Kaiserschmarm at the restaurant where we parked the car. Delish!!
