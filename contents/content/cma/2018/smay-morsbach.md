### Morsbach climbing

_May 21, 2018_

Barbara and I climbed at Morsbach. It's hard to be absolutely certain, but we think
we climbed:

 * Nobody (4+) - I believe this was our first climb.
 * Mini-Flipp (6+) - I only top-roped this.
 * Dreierweg (3+) - with the ending "Direkt zur Terrasse (6-)". But Barbara chose
the ending "Zustieg zur Terrasse (4)."
 * Max (5+) - really nice route on the far right side of the climbing area. This was good
training for me and Barbara both.
 * Unnamed (6-) - it's the route just right of Fingerbeisser (7+), and according to
[Markus](https://www.stadler-markus.de/sportklettern/oesterreich/klettergebiete/news/morsbacher-klettergarten-bei-kufstein.html),
it should be called Mug. In a guidebook I have, the name Mug is given to what should be the
"Via Angela Direkt (5-)." Quite confusing! Anyway, this route is very good, but quite hard,
especially as it's got some real polish on a few footholds you wish didn't have it. Barbara
top-roped this as a great learning project.
 * "Via Angela (4+)" - really nice climb. Barbara top-roped it twice, as she was confused
at the beautiful overhang...it was hard to find the fantastic grips on the top of it!

I wish we could have stayed longer...this place is fantastic...
