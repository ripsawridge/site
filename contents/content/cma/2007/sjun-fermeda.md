### Kleine and Grosse Fermeda attempts
_June 11, 2007_

I road the lift up to Seceda from St. Ulrich at the ridiculously late hour of 8
am. The weather was beautiful for the moment. First I tried to climb a grade IV
route on the Kleine Fermeda, but the wet grass and mud on the first 3 pitches
scared me away. It was truly scary, as everything was slippery from rain the
night before. I had to leave two slings on horns to rappel down.

Discouraged, I thought I'd hike up the Sas Rigais instead. But then I realized
the back side of my Kleine Fermeda topo had a tiny line drawing of the normal
route on the Grosse Fermeda. At grade III it should be easy. So I found the
approximate starting point, and worked my way up gullies and short faces for
about 1000 feet. The weather was getting worse, and I especially debated
continuing when I had to traverse a long and very exposed grade II-III slabby
face. At one point I went up too soon, and found myself on probably grade IV+
terrain in tennis shoes. At that moment it started to rain. Beautiful!

Moving quickly left I got back on route, where I was right below a black face
that needed to be climbed straight up to then continue on to the summit. I
guess I was about 3/4 of the way up. But with the rain, it would be a race
against the rock getting slippery to get down. I descended, then made a
descending traverse to get back to the relative safety of the chimneys and
gullies that made up the lower half of the route. 

On the climb I came across two nice ring bolts, and three slings around
Sanduhrs here and there. I never used them because the rock still wasn't
completely soaked and I could go faster downclimbing. Finally, in very heavy
rain I used the last ring bolt for a rappel in the first grade III chimney.
More downclimbing, then a long walk back up to the Seceda lift to get back to
town.

I kept hoping to go back and finish the route in the following days, but it
never worked out. It was a fun, easy, but exciting climb all the same. It tests
your routefinding skills gently.

AIRY VIEWS ON THE GROSSE FERMEDA. Look down on the steep scrambling of the Grosse Fermeda. Or don't!

Unpleasant traverse. The clouds roll in as I traverse left and up on the normal
route of the Grosse Fermeda (YDS 5.5 here). Oh great, now it's raining :-).
