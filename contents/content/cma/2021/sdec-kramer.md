Really enjoyable hike, up and down in the usual loop way that I do.
I used snowshoes on the ridge and the traverse around the north side, taking
them off during the steep shortcut down unmarked way that avoids going all
the way to the alm. Wow, this trail felt very steep today! It was slow
going on the one-foot-width way down!

Look, the Father, the Son, and Mary. Three crosses, facing the son.
