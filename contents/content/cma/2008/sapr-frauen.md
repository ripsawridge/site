### Frauenwasser Wand
_Late April, 2008_

Daniel A. and I climbed a few pitches in the morning. I again tackled the 3
pitch line of VI, VI and VI grade pitches. This time I led them all without
resting/hanging/etc. Really enjoyable slab climbing here, and the middle pitch
overhang is exciting. I top-roped a VII slab, which was impossible! Moved to a
VI+ line which I mostly got, but leading would be different! The season has
definitely started, because when we left at 11 am it was a knotted cluster of
people, which is hilarious because there is a neighboring crag with some good
routes. Next time we'll visit that crag (Nasse Riss, etc.).
