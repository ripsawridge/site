<h3>Little Si, September 21, 2003</h3>

I went with Ren and Kyle, two great small fellas for their first 
mountain climb. We took the scramble route up the peak, complete with
some 3rd, 4th and even 5th class climbing to the summit. It was the
classy, sassy way! They were excellent fun on the trail, and cheerful
climbers as well. On the summit I drank all of Kyle's water, so he
had to borrow some from Ren. I had been irresponsible and forgotten water
of my own! On the way down, we consumed as much sugar as possible, eating
all the candy in their backpacks. A great day out!
