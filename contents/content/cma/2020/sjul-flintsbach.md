### Flintsbach climbing
_July 5, 2020_

In the evening, we went and did several climbs.

  * "Nur Fliegen ist schöner" (7-)
  * Top-rope on the 6- unnamed route just to the left
  * "Felsrowdy" - pitch one (5), and pitch two (6+/7-). I had to try a few times in the
    middle of pitch two. I wanted to follow the line straight up instead of going
    to the easier left side. Finally I was satisfied to go left for two moves, and then
    back along the line.
  * "Früchte der Saison" (6+/7-) - I'd forgotten the tricky traverse move that gains the
    upper wall of this climb. I did some aid tricks to get a top rope and try everything
    until finally I figured it out. Top-roped it again.
  * "Miles Davies" (6-) - Jong led this very nicely. I re-climbed with the draws in
    place but I lost my nerve at the 3rd clip -- I hung on the rope and worked out the moves.
    I did manage to do the overhang "direct," which is supposedly 6+ but it didn't seem that
    difficult to me.
  * "Kinderleicht" (6-) - I did the slabby 6- section, though it can be avoided with
    chalked-up holds to the left. Great climb.
