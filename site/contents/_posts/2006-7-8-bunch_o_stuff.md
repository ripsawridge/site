Hi all, sorry to write so little. Days are just so full. I really lean
on Kris's blog to tell everyone what's going on with us. But here is some
wierd stuff that happened yesterday.
  
---
  
So I went to Kindermusik with Kris and the kids. I had to leave work at
10:30 to make sure to make it there by 11 with time to spare. I rode my
bike and it's a few miles away. As I was leaving my boss needed to talk
to me for a few minutes. That was fine, now it's like 10:36 and I'm going
down to my bike. Next I'm pedaling along the bike lane, getting just north
of Karlsplatz in front of my very favorite store: the little Berlag Rother
book/map shop that I wish I could just have. Suddenly a black mercedes
swerves into the bike lane and stops! I didn't even have time...I slammed
on the brakes, but the bike hit the car and I took what felt like a slow
motion ride over the hood. I felt everyone on the street watching me. Just
a little shaken, I picked myself up to find I was a-ok...not even a bruise
or scratch! My bike was ok too. I felt bad for the driver, he looked really
worried. It was his fault, but I think I should have been riding slower
too. No harm done...on my way again.
  
  
Now I waited to cross a light, and a nice fellow wanted to know where
the university was. He asked me in German and I am so polite, I felt compelled
to try to point him in the right direction. That duty done, I had to wait
for the next light.
  
  
Okay, ride, ride, ride. About a mile away, a nice woman asked me the way
to Theresienwiese. Okay, I had to help her too...then wait for the next
light. Jeez...I did my quota for the day!
  
  
Finally I arrived breathless just as the class was starting. I had to
wash the grease off my hands from fixing the chain after I hit the car.
Suddenly with no time to adjust I was singing various songs and stomping
my feet. The boys do better each time there. Elijah even "hopped" on cue!
  
  
I walked Kris and the boys back to the U-bahn station, and bought 2 sandwiches
to eat at work. It was starting to rain, so gripping my sandwich bag tightly,
I pedalled away back to the office. Pretty soon I was getting really wet,
but at least it was warm rain.
  
  
Sploosh! Oh no...my bag has disentigrated from the moisture and my sandwiches
spilled out all over the road! "Crap!" I said aloud. It's just not my day.
I had to stop and buy lunch all over again.
  
  
Then I got back to the office and the 2 weeks of excitement that took
place in 2 hours came to a close...everything back to normal. Til next
time!
