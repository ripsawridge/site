Up steeply, but this time traversing around to the west and the dramatic sub-summit.
From there, the ridge is easily followed (game trail?) to join the trail to the summit near the small pretend-chapel.
Down the secondary steep way. Difficult, muddy time in the forest on steep, icy slope with ice under leaves.
