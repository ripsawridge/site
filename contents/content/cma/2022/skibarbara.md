## Friday

We skied up the Kreuzjoch from the road just before the Kühtai
skiing area. I mistakenly thought we were at the saddle near the
Rietzer Grieskogel, however my memories of that mountain were too hazy!
We enjoyed the view up here, then skied down. Southern slopes were
not great, but we eventually found some shaded powder regions.

We enjoyed watching a guy ski up to the saddle west of the Kleiner Mugkogel,
then enjoy a fantastic powder descent after a rest.

Afterwards, time for sauna, dinner, bed!

## Saturday, a run on the Sulzkogel

We skied up rather tiredly below the dam of the Finsterbach. "Do you call
this fun?" asked Barbara at a particularly annoying icy switchback. "Yes!"
I said.

Hee hee...but seriously, I found that if I allowed myself to ask (myself)
that, eventually I would answer "no," and then where would I be? I'd either
have to turn around, because by posing the question, I indicate to myself
that fun is apparently the goal. Or somehow "fix" the problem and go on.
But there is little chance of that! The only reason the question was asked
was that all attempts to fix things already failed. So it must simply
be endured. And how hard it is to suffer...to "endure" when the lack of
fun is uppermost in mind.

Since I don't want to suffer, I won't ask myself if I'm having fun.

When track is icy, I am icy-track.

Basically, I don't micro-manage the self. I let it run as it will.

Higher, we had to traverse the side of the great lake, though we enjoyed
the blocks of blue and green ice below us. I felt that Barbara was pretty
slow today. I realized that she didn't know how to get a little bit of glide
with each step on (fairly) level ground. It's amazing how much that gives
you, even if it's only a few centimeters per step. So this day was a real
hard one for my darling.

Eventually we were climbing, up into the valley southeast of the summit.
Some people turned around here, giving us a bit of worry about the time.
We knew we had to cross above the lake again, and that was quite long.
This place felt remote. Barbara had a slight headache, but was ambitious
for the summit too (she knew it was over 3000 meters, and had never been
that high!). We pushed on to the final slope. About 200 meters below
the summit, it was, however, enough. Fighting with an icy track and by
now a pounding headache, it was time to turn around.

I showed Barbara that we could transition our gear even in a steep slope
like we were on now, simply by stomping out a kind of "home." This worked
well, and soon we were zooming down. Barbara, a bit too tired to enjoy
the fairly decent snow, which meant she really was tired!

At the lake, we watched a couple guys write in the snow and ski across
the frozen lake. We opted for the less comfortable shore however, having
been warned that the water level could be lower than an ice shield that
forms across the lake. We made it across as the sun disappeared (very, very
cold in the shade now!). Quickly down to the car...

## Sunday, an old friend

Sunday we drove partway home and hiked up the Kranzhorn in hiking boots.
Oh, how easy...how fun! This was a great way to end our long weekend.
