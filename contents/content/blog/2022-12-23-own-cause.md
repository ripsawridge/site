*Everything is self-caused...*

According to certain spiritual teachers (I'm thinking of [Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisargadatta_Maharaj),
but there are many). It sounds very strange...but I have thought about it
for a while, and I think it works better as a model of reality than
the one we use. I think it creates a very interesting world.
This is not a "factual" knowledge, for which you can find evidence in a
scientific paper. This is something different, and uninteresting to most folks.

So, whoever remains...let's go!

**Suppose this is true.**

Look at some hikers walking into a wilderness. Already, we construct an
obvious cause-effect chain. The hikers are there on that trail because they
loves nature and desire to hike in it. Cause = love of nature, effect =
hikers on trail. You can come up with many other plausible causes, sure.
But either way, you've got a chain, and all the agency is on the side of
the hikers. Nature itself is passive.

How to break the stranglehold of this idea?

Let's assert that the event is self-caused. How can we construct that?

Perhaps, to the land itself, hiking on it feels something like love. The
way scratches behind the ears feel to a dog. The mental state of the hiker
likely matters. If he is full of appreciation for his surroundings, then
the land feels love.

So we reach one idea: **nature desires to be loved**. Beautiful places long
to be walked.

Now, we can see the appearance of the hikers not as something whose cause
rests only in them, but as evidence of relationship between one locii of
consciousness (the individual hiker) and another (the land).

The appearance of the hiker now signals:

1. The desire of the hiker, yes, *but also*
2. The desire to be hiked on.

Land that desires to be hiked on must be singing. The song is especially
well-heard by the hiker. He answers the call more often and more
quickly than others.

So the event in time is now seen as the **visible manifestation of a
relationship**. I've given some kind of "agency" to the "inert" component.

I hear your objection ("But that is not self-caused! It is still only caused
by 2 actors, one real in my view, and one imaginary, and *don't think I'm
going to grant you life to the imaginary one!*").

I grant you the first objection, but must detour into a defense of
something like "[panpsychism](https://iep.utm.edu/panpsych)"
(consciousness in all things), because you need a working understanding of
that model in order to weigh my response to the first objection.

Summing up: *the event is evidence of a partnership. It is a culmination,
long desired. And the chief actors in the manifestation of that desire may
not be the human ones.*

## In which I try to get you to grant consciousness to all things :)

I'm going to try to convince you but I know you are a hard nut to crack
and will probably walk away unconvinced. But here goes:

**Whenever we can imagine a name, there exists a consciousness called into
subtle being by that name.**

We give energy to that locus point, and the energy that is able to (chooses to?
I'll return to that below)
identify with the formulation responds by identifying itself with that
name. I use the technical word "formulation" to mean the delicate confection
of ideas you hold behind the name when you say it. The formulation can be
simple ("Metallica is BITCHIN!") or complex ("Nature is beautiful...holy even...
but dangerous too..."). The name is shorthand for that formulation.

You are only one of millions of namers. And your work continues across
time and space. So you can see that the locus point of a "great term" like
Nature is enormous, fuzzy, planetary in scale. That locus point attains
gravity...spiritual gravity. This is why many "seekers" love nature. So
many beings have named it with formulations of beauty. They have worshipped
it by walking in it.

It is full of power. Like the bones of saints in Russia (same principle here).

So...the consciousness that accepts identification with the locus point does
so willingly and freely. **This must be so by induction**. Reflect into
your interior and pose the question: does my heart go into anything which I
don't choose at some level? **Can** my heart and will unite behind an
activity or mode of being with which I do not agree?

The answer is no. **Never.** It never did. It never will.

Because you are sovereign.

The Christian religion especially highlights the freedom of God's creatures
to choose the good or to turn away from it. And God does not coerce them.
Were this God to show his face on the street, on the television, in the sky,
that would be a kind of coercion.

The Christian God is no bully. He hides from you until you will Him into your
life.

He allows you to die believing He is not there. He trusts that your nature as
His child will lead you to truth ultimately, though it may require geologic
time.

Ultimately, I have to leave the working out of the proof that consciousness can never be enslaved to you.
I go further and assert that no matter how **humble** the consciousness
is, that principle remains. I mean that a tree is no slave, nor a rock.

Because **if you disagree**, then I pose this question: **where is the dividing
line in reality?** Where is the "highest slave" consciousness, and where the
"lowest free born?"

I am a systems programmer by profession.

I know that every creation of a boundary without firm reason leads to bugs.

If I cannot posit a reason with my mind for why some forms of consciousness
should be bound and others free, then it has no place in my model.

I'm aware that my model is not reality. But I am striving to model reality,
and must use Occam's Razor to avoid unnecessary complexity. A division
between bound and free modes is unnecessary, therefore it is tossed out.

You object: "but the horse is kept in a pen, and led with a harness! He
is not free.".

My answer is that there are always teachers and students. And there
are good and less good relationships between them. Perhaps the horse is
gaining the discipline to follow a human existence by years of association
with humans. The tradeoff for this association is that he must do useful
work for the human. Doing work involves submitting yourself to a discipline,
but it is not slavery. True, some employers abuse their workers. I think we
all agree that the mass factory farming of animal life and industrial
slaughter is some kind of abuse. The relationship is broken. There, yes,
it approaches slavery. But we can all see it. We know it is wrong, and on
some level, restitution should be made. At least we imagine this, and I
do not scoff at our imagination as a guide for what is really real. Because
our imaginations are a thing that grew out of this world, and therefore must
have some basis in truth. And, in our power as namers, we know
justice. We name and designate out of our sense of truth and justice and
beauty. And so we will cast out those aspects of ourselves that are doing
wrong, and enlarge the good. So. I am not completely off-base to think that
restitution will come.

Another objection: "the rock serves me by being carved into a path. I can't
even know if it regards itself as a slave or free! I am the only actor,
it is passive!"

Good point. I'll grant you that the rock appears to do nothing. But once
you were a child. You fell asleep in the back of the car, and your father
carried you into the house and put you in bed. You "did his bidding" though
you weren't aware of it.

Are you so sure it is not this way with the rock? Perhaps some consciousness
is highly focused...very much "here" (wherever the observer is).
But even you are not always highly focused, and you regard yourself as the
"most focused thing" on the planet. Half of the time you are "not here,"
though your body lies on the bed! Perhaps the rock is like that. Perhaps it is
not fully born yet into the world. "Rockness" is crude, "first entry,"
let's say. It is appropriate that such simple, sleeping forms be carved
usefully. There may be a kind of learning in that. Actually, the willingness
to be carved by conditions into something greater is
a principle that we highly admire:

We call it the building of character.

Can you deny the rock the same process of character forming which you
know has benefited you to a great degree? Yes, the time-scale and nature
of the "work" is different. But seen psychologically, there are great
similarities.

So, where are we? I've argued that consciousness is everywhere, and
that free will is necessary for consciousness. Therefore if consciousness
does form around locus points shaped by the "naming angels" of existence
(that would be us), it
must form there freely.

Additionally, because I'm arguing that there are more actors in the event of the
hiker-in-nature than we think, I need to show how communication is made with
the other actors. There
is a "blank space" in the reasoning process of the hiker in which a
*conversation* between the hiker and the nature-consciousness may occur.

## Desire

Why does a free being do anything?

Desire.

The desire may be for the good or the less good. Selfless or selfish.
A good desire may have catastrophic ill effects on an environment, and a
selfish desire may be repeatedly satisfied without anybody noticing ill-effects.

So desire is complex.

Add to this complexity, the complexity of our inner state, with a mix of
conscious and unconscious motivations for action. So there is a chaotic
spiral of complexity in the contemplation of why a being does some
particular thing.

Are you aware of the research that states that we make decisions before we
are mentally aware of them? It suggests a kind of "floating up" into the
mind of the results of a decision which was actually made at some deeper
level. The mind then quickly rationalizes why that is the right decision,
which is a humorous picture! I see Roald Atkinson as an administrative
functionary making important sounding noises that justify departmental
policies.

When something is very complex, we don't solve it rationally. We "sleep on it,"
we allow our "gut" to help decide. We look for signals in the exterior
world, or we pray to God for help in illuminating the correct answer.
We are, in fact, **asking for a peer-to-peer communication with the
object or mode of our desire**.

I posit that such questions receive answers. That we do get help. The fact
that we rail up and down that we don't, that we *never* do, that such help
*never* comes is because of our curious cultural conditioning. We stand
on a peculiar peninsula which views the world as clockwork without a God.
We can make these assertions all we want. Other cultures wouldn't blink
so hard at the idea that prayers are answered in some way.

Anyway, the choice of model is up to you. I'm saying that after close
internal introspection, I found the idea of such communication not implausible.
Not "outrageous."

In the fruition of your desire there is communication. At levels beyond
the mind. And because free will is bound into the universe, that communication
is between free beings and therefore it is essentially polite.

Are you unhelpful without a cause? Maybe on your worst day. But not your
average day. So it is reasonable to conclude that communication with
entities of consciousness is both polite, and well-meant and well-received.

To sum this up: *your desire sets off a chain of communication with
locii of consciousness suited to fulfill your desires. This mechanism is
hidden from your objective consciousness for various reasons, one of which
is cultural.*

## Returning to the narrative

I've offered a worldview of panpsychism, and a mechanism by which commmunication
is made from "you" to the rest of this field of consciousness. Let me now
return to the story of the hiker and nature, and hopefully I can finish this
up without taxing your patience too much (you have already been very
generous to me!).

The hikers in our image are a part of the stream of humanity that names and
loves what it has named.

Nature has taken the identity of the named, and cavorts in delight at
the attention paid.

In the meantiime, the hikers "make themselves ready" for Nature.

The hikers imagines Nature as residing in a particularly far and beloved place.
Nature gets a name like "[the Gila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_River),"
or "[the Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marshall_Wilderness)," or "[Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marshall_Wilderness)."

The hikers do not enter the temple without appropriate sacrifies. They
train to be strong in the eyes of the beloved.

They arrive with mighty works of protection to signal to Nature how grand,
real and even dangerous she is. We call these things

* "Bear spray"
* "Warm, synthetic layers"
* "Water purification tablets"

So...if you are the hiker, you have **named** her, this Nature you adore.
You have described her attributes and made them real through your response
to them.

Think of it now from her point of view. She is likely not a focused, human-style
consciousness. She is aggregate, dispersed, yet powerful through the tide
of feeling rippling through a vast unconscious hinterland which is her body.

She wants to please you, for you have played a role in creating an aspect
of her being.

As you approach, she *knows* your steps.

As you huff and puff over passes, she *holds* her breath.

And now you are here.

But so is she.

It is more realistic to say that you and Nature together set the table of
this moment long before. And now you both dine at it.

Do you see the celebration, the possibility and the **naturalness** in this
mode of thought about events in time?

How does it compare to the model your teachers drilled into you, in which
agency is confined to bodies of meat with sufficiently sized brains?

Are you not always trying to escape the dominion of that mode of thought?
Isn't that mode "the city" or "the valley" which you climb out of?

I therefore bring you this other way of looking at things.

Meditate on it and if it plants fruit in you then you can call it good.

This here is an event, which we've certainly planned together.

## P. S. I forgot to grant the event agency!

So Nature and the hikers conspired, then met on a blue-sky day. But I said
every event is its own cause. Well. It is like this: there must be a place of
meeting. The event is the "place."

Just imagine if you could hold a historic meeting between Israelis and Palestinians,
with a great chance for peace between them. You would **run, not walk** home
to set the table and light the candles.

You would submit yourself as "a place" in which two entities can meet.

Now. Who caused the whole thing? Did you not create a **vacuum in space**
with your desire, which already existed, to serve God by improving the life
of His creatures? Your desire was there. The Israelis were there, and the
Palestinians. Your house was there. The food was there.

And this event...since you can only partially understand your desires, how
much of that desire is wholly your creation, and how much of it exists in
you because you agree with a particular idea of peace and harmony through
**communication** with some entity?

Is it your house, after all? You know it is not solely your event.

In fact...where is the cause?

Where is the single cause?

**Therefore: it is closer to the truth to say, events are self-caused. And
the self that causes the event has all of the sensitivity, the subtlety,
the agency that you imagine for yourself.**

*Thank you for listening...send me an email with any objection or idea...I
will add it to this and continue a thread...for I wish to be a meeting
ground, too.*
