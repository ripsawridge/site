### No ice left
_February, 2013_

Georg and I went to climb one of the falls around Ettal (I forgot the name). We soloed a couple of pitches, then after one belayed pitch we came to a steep and almost completely hollow column full of streaming water. Didn't look safe. We decided to return to Munich and catch up on work instead...my god...what is wrong with us?!?
