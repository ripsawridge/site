"Casara" Route (IV+, 7 pitches)
----------

In the morning it was raining. So much for one of the hard routes. It
was also very cold. Finally, around 11 weather lightened up enough to make
the hike back over the Col-de-Medo Pass for the Torre Comici. It was an
easy climb, but at least a chance to get something done with my last day.
We endured a long and tiring scree climb to reach the base. Jesse was pretty
tired, and I definitely understood where he was coming from!

I had the first lead, up a IV+ dihedral and chimney. Near the end of the
pitch, my fingers got really cold. With the wind whistling, me blowing
on my fingers, and trying to negotiate the crux moves, things didn't look
great for continuing. I reached the belay and Jesse said his motivation
had just crumpled away. Realizing that we were looking at some only moderately-enjoyable
hours of cold and mediocre climbing, I had no problem with leaving. I rapped
and cleaned the gear, we zoomed down the scree and like that, my trip came
to a close. Jesse would do some hiking and then continue a grand summer
of climbing that is still going on.

_The way beyond. Ech. Not very inspiring!_

_At least the anchor was good! (Yes, for the Dolomites, this is "bomber")_
  
  
It had been great fun. I was really happy to meet and climb with Jesse.
We had many great conversations and saw totally "eye to eye" on the meaning
of and practice of the climbing game. I'm eager for him to come back. I'm
positive we'll bite off some big chunks of our shared bigger goals. Including
Saturday's Totenkirchl climb (described in another report), we'd climbed
more than 70 pitches in 9 days.
  
  
Berg heil!
