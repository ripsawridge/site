This report was written while in a groggy-eyed state, high on pain killers. I'd also been reading "The Guns of August." The references to right and left flanks shouldn't surprise anyone who read that before. Take with a large helping of salt. Peter also wrote a report 
<a href="http://www.alpenthyme.org/alp/chairnebuttress/chairnebuttress.htm">
here
</a>.

As I was tying in to lead the first pitch, Aidan's ice tools boxed me in the
ears. "Oh I'm sorry Michael, here, let's get you out of that rope". Before I
knew it, I was mumbling "on belay", utterly confused but increasingly sure I'd
had a great lead stolen from me! Peter and I watched the boy on thin ice with
baited breath. Possibly feeling bad about the whole affair, Aidan delivered many
icy souvenirs of the climb, which I caught with knees and knuckles. We saw him
one last time as he delicately eased over a short rocky overhang with good
sticks in the ice above. Finally the rope came tight, and we dismanteled the
belay (an ax and a picket). Two guys from Bellingham climbed a left variation,
making inspiring moves on thin ice over rock. "So that's how it's done." I
comforted myself with the idea that I had just learned a lot.



Peter and I climbed about 15 feet apart. Right away, the climbing was exciting
as the ice was thin, the snow was useless, the rock was holdless, and I mentally
congradulated Aidan for the lead. "CRANG!" went my ice ax on rock under the
snow. A large serving plate of hard snow broke free and menaced Peter. My foot
held it in place until he could get his face above it. After that, it became
excitement for the huddled masses below. I wondered what they were doing. I felt
like a top-roper at Exit 38 out here, jeez! The little overhang was fantastic,
and when the gully curved back to the left I was sold on this mixed climbing
thing. Even the waves of spindrift and chunks of ice from the upper party didn't
bother me. "'Sup?" I said nonchalantly. Peter the Alaskan came up, wishing for
more ice but glassy-eyed from the great climbing. "Is there frozen snot in my
beard yet?" he asked wistfully.


I wanted the long steep snow climb above our tree belay, but to my surprise I'd
been stumped. Peter had neatly severed both legs above the knee! "On belay"
smirked Aidan. Oh well. I took pictures of the Alaskan struggling in the
spindrift and giggled for warmth. <i>"How do you like me now, MOTHER
NATURE?"</i> was my hysterical cry, which set Aidan to giggling too. At this
point the route really was crowded. The Bellingham pair was speedy, and
converged with Peter below an icefall. The party with the orange pack were also
converging just below him. I thought of Pete Shoening. "Am I a Pete?", I asked
Aidan. "You look like an Art," he replied evenly.


In time, new legs grew and we followed Peter, still climbing to a hoped-for
belay. Gullies and cliffs of the north shoulder appeared and vanished in the
clouds. A weak prehistoric sun cut through the gauze, and the wind died in
synchronicity. I admired our position. What elan we displayed! The larger the
right wing, the easier to smash through the center! We waited while Peter tried
to get some good ice screws in. Every time I looked up, he was screwing one in,
so the impression was one of "grid bolting." Then he climbed higher, and Aidan
and I got nervous about our exposed position. "One shouldn't entirely overlook
the defensive," I lectured. I imagined ants connected by string, and the top ant
falling. Then we were climbing and I was an American again: simple and virtuous.


At Peter's ice screw belay, we got things sorted out, and I crunched up to the short ice cliff.
I placed two screws in mediocre ice at the base to back up Peter's belay, and carefully climbed up.
The ice was too thin over the rock to place gear in, but was solid for crampon and tool placements.
I remember looking straight down at Peter and Aidan, and the sweep of the route thus far. I really
wanted to take a picture, but was hanging from my tools, and needed to finish the move. 
I emerged onto crusty snow, placed a picket, then kept going up a steep snow slope that accepted
good kick-steps. It took a long time to find a reasonable belay anchor. I finally settled for a
knife-blade, pounded halfway in, and a slung block. Every other crack I tried to get a piton in
turned out to be between two moveable blocks! On the other side of the gully the climber with
the orange pack ("cracked"), had found a belay anchor, and was bringing up his partner.
I really enjoyed belaying and looking at the incredible view which came and went in clouds.



Aidan kept going from there up easier slopes placing occasional protection.  We
unroped at a saddle and crunched across some snow up to the summit. Aidan had
carried an earring in his pocket by accident. Luckily for him, he didn't lose
it, otherwise a particular young lady would have been rather miffed. We took a
picture of him and the earring so everyone would know that whatever happened
next - the golden treasure made it this far. Peter had a small thermos of hot
tea, and the portioned out sips were delicious.


After a long rappel from a lower saddle (isn't that an amazingly Byzantine
anchor?), we downclimbed hard snow covered with a few inches of breakable
windpack. Down to Thumb Rock, then the best boot glissading ever. We were making
turns, jumping off steep things, it was fun. After a while, we met a party of
snowshoers who invited us to what they called a "safety meeting." Once we
determined the nature of said meeting, we departed somewhat hastily. "Scared you
away, huh? Meetings over, huh?"  they called as we skied away on our boot soles.


We ate at a new BBQ place at the Middle Fork Road exit. It was really good.
Thanks to Peter and Aidan for a perfect climb!
