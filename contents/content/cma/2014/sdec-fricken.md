### Hoher Fricken
_December 28, 2014_

Nice snowshoe hike up the KÃ¼hflucht. Near the top, I met another party and I
helped them out by making tracks with snowshoes. They had plans to go down
another way to the south, and I was game to try that too. I went off ahead
because I was cold. I heard them behind me, but after a time, their voices
receded. I went through quite deep snow, and I wonder if they turned around?
Plus, it was snowing steadily. I emerged on a road with a fine sledding track
which provoked feelings of envy. 1300 meters up and down.
