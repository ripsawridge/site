Whew, more exploration of the Brandenberger Alpen! I was back on the trail to
the Ascherj√∂chl, and this time I continued up to the Plessenberg summit. In
answer to a small prayer, the cloud obscuring the summit all the way up
disappeared as I approached. Yes! So I could see the Inntal and all around. I
tagged the Heuberg summit too, just for fun. Looks like this was about 1400
meters up and down.

Back down to the car, then I drove to a shady meadow to make some delicious
salami, Kaiser Max cheese and Dijon mustard sandwiches. After about an hour of
taking it easy, I was ready for the second hike.

Clocking in at about 890 meters up and down, I followed a road from Embach up to
the Buchacker Alm, making my high point a little hillock shortly after the
division of the Hundesalm and Buchacker Alm roads divide (also marked by a bench
on a small hill). That bench was occupied by a cheerful biker, so I continued a
bit further hoping for expansive views to the north (partially successful). This
is a very beautiful high Alm which has a very "in the sky" feeling because it's
not dominated by still-higher looming peaks. I think the road walk is a bit
unfortunate, but at least it's very steep. On the way down I took some trail
short-cuts, but my god, they were nearly vertical tree-roots at times.

So, grand total of 890 + 1400 = 2290 meters, or 7513 feet, whew! What a nice day.
