Jong and I climbed "[Logic Line](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/logic-line/)" on the Schärtenspitze (2153 m)..
The conditions were cold and cloudy, but happily it didn't rain!

The first pitch was wet, which woke me up pretty nicely, however
the rest of the route was dry. The first four pitches maxed out at
grade 3+. We got a bit mixed up with the belays, but were in the
right place for the exciting pitch 5 (rated 4+/5-), which featured
some steep slabby moves at the belay anchor then a steep
"Wasserrille" climb. Really great!

From here it was easy climbing to the trail. We decided to tag the summit,
so we walked up for about thirty minutes. On top there were occasional
good views to snowy walls around us. We chatted with two climbers who
planned on doing a technical traverse but were stymied by weather.

The Watzmann from the Hochalm.

We walked over to the Eisbodenscharte and descended into the neighboring
valley. This was a bit harder than just descending the trail back the way
we came, but I was keen for the extra exercise, and to see this mysterious
second valley. Jong was worried about snow, and indeed, there were about
10 meters of odd/difficult downclimbing with one foot on steep snow and the
other on crumbly rock. After much fairly easy snow descent, we were
wringing out our socks on green hillside looking over to the Watzmann in
the distance.

We followed the "Schärtensteig" back to the road which led to the car.
Man, this was tiring! A very long walk around the hillside, seemingly more
up than down. We distracted ourselves from our tired legs with hearty
conversation about trumpism, nationalism, globalism, and all the other
tendencies of people in the mass. I'd started a big discussion about the
use of scientific models to advise government policy, and we had a great
time exploring the corners of that subject. The many possibilities for
bias and misuse on the part of not only the politicians, but individual
scientist-advisors, too.

I'm really feeling sad that an individual can hold a tool in a very
deft way, operating very skillfully and subtly, but that humble and
inquisitive spirit-of-use rarely finds expression in the domain of
mass communication and politics. Hmpf!

Thanks Jong for a great day, and thank you Schärtenspitze for not spitzing us
off! a-Ha! A Ha ha ha!
