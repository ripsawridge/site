### Hirschberg
<i>December 30, 2011</i>

I skied up Hirschberg, an old favorite. It was snowing hard, and I was there in the middle of the day so the lift skiing area I go through was full of people. That was a new experience. I didn't bother with the true summit, not wanting to go on a long flat walk to just gain another 20 meters in height. The wind was fierce on top. I quickly switched to downhill mode and skied the heck out of there. Super great skiing!
