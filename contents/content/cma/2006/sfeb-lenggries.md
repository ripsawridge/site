### Lenggries skiing, February 15, 2006

I took the day off and we got a baby sitter so that Kris and I could go skiing together
for the day. It was tons of fun...it definitely sped by too fast! Kris had learned so
much in her lessons, we could go down all kinds of red (blue in the U.S.) runs together.
She found a few things difficult, like skiing on roads that populate this small ski area,
and the narrowness of some of the runs. But overall she was teaching me how to ski better.
We had a nice lunch, and then had the great fortune to run into Kris's friend Vivian
from the ski class. She was there with her friend from Birmingham, England. We talked
on the train home. It was a great day!
