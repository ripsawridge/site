## Music

I've been a musician for a long time. I played violin, clarinet, saxaphone, piano,
then finally guitar which continued the rest of life. I wanted to be a
composer, or a rock star, or something like that. My teenage life was all
about music, and it was difficult to transition away from it. I wanted
financial security and didn't understand how I might get it in that world.

But through the years I made things. I used to have this stuff on Soundcloud,
and someone would pop by now and again to give a like. But they kicked
Andy Ngo off their platform and I removed my stuff right when I found that
out. We've got to let bullies go their own way. I'm sure they are "fine,"
but I feel much better knowing my music is here and not with them.

The order is somewhat random. I think the best song is at the top. Then,
songs I wrote for or with my boys, so I'm proud of those. Then a song
about Barbara. And then the rest is stuff from my life, here and there.

* [Dawn Treader](/assets/music/Dawn%20Treader.mp3) - This is my most recent music.
I wanted to capture the slow, golden dawning of bliss in meditation. It works
for me. I like the architecture provided by the horns in the last part.

* [Aliens in Space](/assets/music/Aliens%20in%20Space.mp3) - I roped the boys into
recording this one day around 2009 or 2010 or so. Rowan got so excited in
the battle scene, he was really worked up I remember!

* [Rowan of the Hills](/assets/music/Rowan%20of%20the%20Hills.mp3) - The idea was
that Rowan was once a great norse hero who gave his life to protect the
village. I had fun with the guitar solo here.

* [The Elijah Song](/assets/music/ElijahSong%20Vocals.mp3) - Elijah was **so
crazy** for Legos when he was little. This song tries to capture that moment.

* [Barbara](/assets/music/Barbara.mp3) - My beloved Barbara...my vision is of
us living out here, walking the land always. How we found each other and
will always be together. I guess I recorded this in 2017 or so, overcoming
my fear of singing just enough to record this one song!

*  [01 Stars and Fire](/assets/music/01%20Stars%20and%20Fire.mp3) - an improv session
with a delay pedal. This style of music makes me think of landscapes of the
American west...just playing it makes me want to walk and walk...

* [Those Grey Eyes](/assets/music/02%20Those%20Grey%20Eyes.mp3) - the melody here
is from a guy on YouTube, I'll have to find that information again. I embellished
it and this was the result. The guitar is my baritone acoustic guitar.

* [04 Cave within the cave](/assets/music/04%20Cave%20within%20the%20cave.mp3) - more
improv clean guitar sound.

* [WinterProject](/assets/music/WinterProject.mp3) - and still more! I love that
stuff.

* [Alone](/assets/music/Alone.mp3) - my friend Charles once made a music
video for this piece, really cool! I made this in 2016 or 2017.

* [Asein](/assets/music/asein.mp3) - In 2008 when I worked at Avid, there was
some political situation at work and it inspired me to delve into LBJ
White House recordings and piece together this ominous-sounding thing.

* [Network 23](/assets/music/Network%2023.mp3) - My cover of the Tangerine Dream
original. My sister Tamara introduced me to Tangerine Dream in the early 80s,
and I was hooked on that space-age synth sound. This song always stuck with
me.

* [At the End](/assets/music/At%20the%20End.mp3) - probably my best "guitar
instrumental." So many overlaid guitars. Really enjoyed making this and I'm
proud of the result.

* [Bruchtal](/assets/music/Bruchtal%201.mp3) - this is a 15 minute long story
that I wrote in 2015 set to music. Nobody gets it, lol. I think it's about
the sweetness of death, at times. Eventually, it will be necessary to die.
And I hope that we all come into relationship with the "monster" as the woman
in the story does.

* [On The Nature Of Daylight](/assets/music/On%20The%20Nature%20Of%20Daylight.mp3) -
I transcribed this beautiful piece by Max Richter, then recorded the parts
on guitar. His version with strings is better...I just wanted to emulate.

* [Panzerwasch](/assets/music/panzerwasch%201.mp3) - a precursor to the film
Charles produced in 2021...he sent me footage of frogs in a pond (a former
tank-washing station), and I recorded this.

* [Grandma's Birthday](/assets/music/Grandma's%20Birthday.mp3) - my mom loved
it when I improvised on piano around her. For her birthday one year, I
made this and the boys added a message, too.

* [Murphy's Law](/assets/music/murphys_law.mp3) - Made on my 4-track recorder,
age 19, living with my mom and stepdad Tom in Huntsville, Texas. Tom gets a
mention in the song. It's a kind of origin story for what we call Murphy's Law.
That was such a happy time living with them.

* [New Stabba](/assets/music/newStabba.mp3) - I forgot his name, but this was recorded on
an 8-track at the house of a friend in Hillsboro, Oregon in 1997. I was so impressed
with his production skills. We wrote the tune together, I came up with the
guitar parts. It was a great evening.

* [Samwise](/assets/music/Samwise.mp3) - Kris and I had a wonderful orange
cat named Samwise. This was before we had kids -- we had energy to make songs
to our cats!

* [Saucy!](/assets/music/Saucy!.mp3) - once I entered a guitar "shredding"
contest. I was such a big fan of that music as a teenager!

* [Smithy](/assets/music/Smithy.mp3) - I played hooky from work one day to
write and record this. I called it Smithy because I was listening to the Smiths
a lot at the time, and I thought it had that kind of sound.

* [Sleepless City](/assets/music/Sleepless%20City.mp3) - okay, this is a strange
one. It's a poem by Lorca that captured my imagination, so I wrote this
music around it. Sometime in the early 2000s I think.

* [Sundown](/assets/music/Sundown.mp3) - I worked on this piece from 2018
to 2020 or so...it took a long time to come up with the second part. What
I like about it is that the melody is the same throughout, but the chords
underneath the second part become much darker and more dramatic.

* [Thank you (remix)](/assets/music/Thank%20You%20\(remix\).mp3) - I made
quite a few pieces of music like this after 2015. I was discovering meditation,
and had lots of emotional trauma/drama to deal with. My headspace was one
of sadness and perception of beauty at the same time.

* [Time](/assets/music/Time.mp3) - This is from 1990, when I was studying
music composition. It was part of something like an opera I was making
on the "Martian Chronicles" by Ray Bradbury.

* [Walkin](walkin.mp3) - Just a happy song from 2019 or so.

* [Which You, Which World](/assets/music/Which%20You,%20Which%20World.mp3) - for
about 4 years I was really into the "Seth Material," these interesting
documents channeled from the beyond by Jane Roberts. I tried to capture the
energy released on thinking about the possibility of multi-dimensional life...
the many worlds you may inhabit.

* [Who Are You Today?](/assets/music/WhoAreYouToday_.mp3) - 2016. A happy
piece of music, with a bit of mystery at the end, which I called "death."
It's a recognition that life is an adventure, and great mystery awaits, too.

* [Yesterday](/assets/music/yesterday.mp3) - I'm playing the guitar and
singing the Beatles hit. I include this only for honesty, not because my
singing is any good. I became less afraid of my voice, and didn't mind to
sing, as homage to this wonderful song.

* [You're my DAR](/assets/music/You're%20my%20DAR%20master.mp3) - I used to call
Kris my D.A.R., short for darling, clearly, but I turned it into an
acronym like the movie D.A.R.R.Y.L. The joke was along the lines of
unnecessary acronymization. We always laughed, so it worked for us! Anyway,
I was trying to make better songs. This was recorded on an iPad, maybe 2013
or so.

## Zwölf Monate - Background Music

My friend Charles made a film about a nature preserve to the north of here.
I wrote the following music for it, some of which can be heard quietly
in the background of his film on occasion. Written from 2020 to 2021:
