### 2 days with Timo

Timo and I skied up the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel in the Sellrein. Fun day! We broke trail for the first two-thirds
of the route, then stronger people came! Beautiful deep powder. We stayed in Gries that evening with a nice old
fellow. The next day we climbed the Bafflfall, good fun, then went to the Martinswand to climb the via ferrata.
I got freaked out with my slippery gloves, and ended up on a hiking adventure in the forest on the left side of
the Martinswand, following game trails up cliffs and steep forest. By the time I got back, Timo was waiting at
his van, like, "what happened to you?" Oh well, it all worked out on this nice day.
