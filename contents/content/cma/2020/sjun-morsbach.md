### Morsbach climbing
_June 24, 2020_

Jong and I spent the morning climbing at Morsbach. Did a number of routes from 5+ to 7-,
not always successfully! First in the middle part of the slab, where I also hoped
to climb the 6- corner "Verschneidung," but it was extremely wet. Then on the left side.
Feet and fingers sore -- very good!
