Saturday morning I was skiing up from Galt체r at 7:30\. I made it to just
below the Jamtalh체tte at 9:45, had some tea and cookies behind a rock where
I hid from the wind. I think that was pretty good time because the guidebook
says it should take 3 hours. I continued in the valley for a few more minutes
then turned right on tracks leading up to the Totenfeld Glacier and the
Haagspitze summit. The wind was strong, blowing down from the valley head
and the impressive Vordere Jamtalspitze. Talking with my friend on Friday
about the proposed trip, we worried about hot, wet, avalanche-prone slopes.
But I actually had the opposite problem! The wind prevented the crusty,
icy, skied-out slope from unfreezing.

The Totenfeld Glacier has some impressive icy walls, which I skirted on
the right. A short steep slope facing south led to the summit. No worries
of avalanche today. A group of 5 french-speaking folks came awkwardly down
the frozen slope. I made new tracks to get up as my skins were slipping
in polished tracks. Stashing my skis in a semi-protected area, I clambered
to the summit, holding my breath for the final dash across a rooftop in
violent wind. I hunkered down behind some rocks and started alternately
taking pictures and warming my hands. The sky was blue and the sun was
out, but the good weather was coming to an end. Clouds scraped by Piz Buin
and the Dreil채nderspitze, peaks I'd climbed 2 years before with Christian.
Clearly, the bad weather in the south was coming to get us!
  
  
I scraped gracelessly down the summit-slope, then found decent conditions
on the glacier. I would search out wind-protected pockets where I knew
forgiving powder snow was hiding. I continued this behavior all the way
down to the valley floor, at one point running into the worst "breakable
crust" (_bruschharsh_, in German) I'd ever seen. I simply couldn't
turn in it at all. My light Dynafit ski setup was at a disadvantage here...I
would go clattering off the wrong way. Ei yi yi...
  
  
In the hut I met a nice older fellow named Heinz. He told about his love
for these mountains and his grandkids. Meanwhile the wind and clouds built
outside...
  
  
The next day I hoped to make a big traverse and bag three peaks. I skinned
up and to the south to the Chalausferner (a glacier), along with two other
guys named Michael and Berndt. We seemed to be the only ones trying to
get out today. We traveled in a murk of cloud and light snowfall, sometimes
swirled up into icy blasts from unexpected directions.

On the glacier I pulled ahead, and then waited for Michael and Berndt
because I wasn't sure if I was right below the pass or needed to continue
on steeper glacier to the right. Getting out the map wasn't an option in
the screaming wind. In fact, rocks peppered the white slope around me,
having been flung here from 100 meters away! After a few minutes I skied
down to them, and they confirmed I was at the pass. We had a brief pow-wow,
and I decided to do whatever they did for the moment. I wasn't going to
go off into Italy by myself in a cloud with these conditions. We figured
to hit the pass and hide in some rocks Michael knew about on the other
side. Then we could decide if we wanted to ski the Augstenspitze or just
turn around.
  
  
But after a few minutes of skinning back up to my high point, it was clear
it would be crazy to continue. We could barely see the pass in swirling
snow, though it was only a short distance above (50 feet?). We organized
for descent with freezing fingers, then got the hell out of there. Again
a mix of good snow and breakable crust on the way down, though ending in
an unexpectedly nice wind-protected gully with decent snow.
  
  
I said goodbye to the guys, who were going to the hut for tea. I pointed
my skis down-valley for the 7 mile ride to Galt체r. It went pretty fast,
but there were some tiring sections where I had to skate to make it across
some flats or up a short hill.
  
  
Out at around noon, I tried to figure out what to do with the rest of
the day. 1000 meters of elevation gain just wasn't enough! I drove back
over the Fernpass (getting in a 45 minute long traffic jam...grr.), then
decided to hike up the good ol' Kramerspitze in Garmisch. I just carried
car keys, an iPod and 5 euros up the hill. I reached the hut in 30 minutes,
and the high pass in something like 1.5 hours. Another 1000 meters gain.
It was enough. I only had tennis shoes and no gloves, so making the snowy
traverse to the main summit didn't seem wise. On the way back down I had
a cappucino in the hut, then headed home.

So, I didn't really find the great skiing I expected for such a long trip.
But I saw some interesting mountains and got some exercise. Good enough!
