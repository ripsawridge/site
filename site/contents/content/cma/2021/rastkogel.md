Timo and I had a fantastic day in the Zillertal, hiking up the Rastkogel and
down a meandering ridge.

We had about a dozen different jokes going on at once. For example, we
were going to pass by a couple of lakes, and Timo would exit after the
first one to grab another peak south on the ridge. "It's likely, sadly
for you, that the Lady of the Lake will deliver the sword to me at
the second, larger lake, Timo," I said.

"Yes, and she'll ask you to warm up her from the cold water!" he said.

We went on like this, eventually ending up with the scenario that
this Lady would probably rather be in the smaller, warmer lake that he'd
pass by independently, while I'd have the unsettling task of entertaining
an old, naked faerie-man along my way. Most unpleasant!

We talked about how socialism always "creeps" forward, and because it
always has a tearful eye for the "oppressed," it loads burden after
burden onto the back of the rule-abiders. Timo mentioned that in the
European immigration regime, those Afghans who come here and fill out
all their paperwork dutifully are sent home posthaste, because they
are the easy ones to find and catch. While those openly hostile to the
rule of law are somehow everywhere and nowhere, and the enforcement
regimes throw up their hands and declare nothing can be done.

Besides, they are likely oppressed peoples as well.

Ach, so it is!
