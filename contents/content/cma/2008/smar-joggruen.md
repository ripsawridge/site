### Jog to (near) Gruenwald and back
_March 16, 2008_

What, am I turning into a jogger? My neighbor Riki convinced me to run to a
bridge near Gruenwald and back and so we did that and it was pretty fun. I
normally give myself plenty of walk breaks, but she made me run the whole time
for all but 3 1 minute walk breaks which I had to beg for. Pretty sore today!
12 miles.
