*From my diary. Meditation does something to you, slowly, as the flame
changes the candle.*

I begin to understand the holiness of **objectivity**.

----

In the space between subject and object is the Ground of Being. Here resides the
One, my master, to whom I cleave. To one side is the personality, the "Michael."
To the other, and towards which his gaze is directed, lies the object of his
consternation. His infatuation, his fear or desire.

Objectivity is holy because it is already a movement in the direction of God.
For God is everywhere that Ego-Self is not. By saying goodbye to a locus of
consciousness *inside* the personality, you move to a more useful location.

Before, I translated objective to mean "loveless," and therefore found nothing in
the idea to encourage me to move towards it. I always want heart and mind together.
I may leave my mind at home and follow my heart. But I never do the opposite.
I'd rather be wrong for the right reasons than right but without love. Other
personalities may do the opposite and that's fine.

Now, I see that the objective space is full of love, only improved by losing it's
fraught quality, it's claustrophobia when experienced inside the shell of
personality. Since the personality is unavoidably aware of it's fragile nature,
bound in time, it can only love what makes it feel safer. In this sense, it will
eventually hate the truth, because it's truth is death.

The greatest truth that it can ever know is run from.

We've been running since our consciousness awoke. All of my work is about the
stopping and the slow turning. All of [my music](https://soundcloud.com/ripsawridge/dawn-treader).
All of my words, and my mountain
climbing. They are not special. They are the universal experience of every human,
given enough time. I should say it differently: given enough experience of time
to perceive the sameness of it.

To the fugitive speeding away from the law, all of the country outside the car window
becomes the same.

While typing in this diary entry, and looking for a nice image for the post
I stumbled upon a picture that describes this truth. A long time ago I
was friends with some guys who started a band. One of those guys knew secrets
about existence way beyond what I knew, anyway. I don't know how he made
this album cover, or if it even is an album cover, but this is the truth.
The monster approaches. But it is no monster:

There is such intelligence and compassion in the unfolding of a world as a series
of contextual situations in which the personality comes to knowledge through
confrontation with the objects of its thoughts.

In the end, that knowledge will propel the consciousness out of the personality
towards the center space, and this motion is itself willed by the personality, who,
yes!, has been enlisted in the search for truth. Led to a place by its investigations
that ultimately reduces its importance to the level of a tool (though a well-loved one),
it joyfully participates in the final step: the goodbye and the well-wishing.

The birth, in fact, of something new.
