It was great to see Pete again! I drove to Geneva, a little worn out by heavy
traffic around Zurich, but my spirits were restored by a wonderful, healthy
dinner with his family. In the morning I read a story to the small fellow of the
house, and we played with some wooden toys I brought. Pete and I set off in the
late morning, semi-exasperated with poor weather reports. It was raining.

We decided to head to Ailefroide, and fought bizarre traffic jams all the
way. But no matter, by the evening we'd picked an excellent rock climb for the
next day. Sadly, I don't know what it's called, but it was fantastic! Rated 5c,
and about 14 pitches, it was a long and moderate romp up bolt-protected granite
slabs and corners.

We slept at the Ailefroide campground, a pretty unique place. Saturday night we
hiked up to the base of the route which had a great view down to the
tents. During the night it rained a bit (the bivy sack was a bit problematic but
still adequate, at least for today).

A crux pitch at 5b



We hiked up and swapped leads the whole way, enjoying the moderate ground
tremendously. We talked about all the vagaries of modern life, raising kids,
vacations, whether to live in Europe or the USA. All good problems!

Then, I think we started the rappels a bit too hastily. Another party sped up
behind us, and we walked to the obvious rappel anchor and made our first rappel,
which should have been 50 meters. Hmm. I blew past that with no sign of an
anchor, and made it to a strange tree-based anchor system at the exact end of
rope stretch for a 60 meter rope. In fact, I had to clip to a solitary bolt on
the face, release the ropes for Pete, and then solo a couple meters across to
the anchor. This was strange, and it worried me!

Our route


Pete came down and we saw on the diagram a big "NO!" marked at the little tree
island on the cliff where we were. Awesome. Har.

I was inclined to grumble about the whole thing, but Pete didn't see a huge
problem. If we could just traverse off right we could rejoin the rappel
line. Indeed, this worked despite my premonitions. I realized I was kind of
replaying some previous rappel mistakes in my head, "resonating" with various
past conditions.

So we got back on the line and anchor system with two rappels, only one severely
diagonal. I left quick-draws to hold the line, and Pete was able to retrieve
them since I could hold the rope below him. Natch!

The rest of the descent proceeded normally. It was early afternoon, and we still
had some energy. So we went over to an impressive 70 meter high slab on the
other side of the campground. Pete and I both led a fairly difficult 5c. Then I
tried to lead a 6a, but my gosh, it was hard! I resorted to aid to clip a bolt
above me, then tried to get the moves properly with limited success. After the
crux, the terrain eased. All good learning!

We had an excellent pizza dinner in the campground. Later, somewhat tired, and
stressed by the ever changing weather reports (sun? rain! No? Sun again? Really?
Rain!), we started to wonder if we'd driven too far south and should have waited
somewhere else for rain to stop. I started to get the idea that a persistent low
pressure system is an almost living enemy of climbers: it corrodes confidence,
sends you on fruitless missions and feeds on dashed hopes!

Rappelling



But we read the tea leaves of the forecast, then checked our own motivations and
abilities, finally deciding that making a break back north for high country was
the right idea. We readied for an early morning departure to the neighborhood of
Arolla for a run at the Dent d'Herens.

* * *

The type-A portion of my personality was happy with an early morning departure,
and the empty roads felt nice. Later, there was no traffic around Turin which
was a relief, too. We had some great baked bread along the way.

At the trailhead I was attacked by an upset stomach, eventually finding relief
at a restroom near the dam. Whew! Terrible how such mundane problems can loom
large...

We made a long walk along the lake, then stopped at a restaurant at the far end
for an excellent spaghetti lunch. Mmmm. In muggy heat, we kept hiking into a
long boulder-filled valley. It started to rain, then kept raining quite heavily
for hours. I had taken off my shirt before, and eventually my arms were so cold
that they hurt. Pete was off up ahead, and he found a nice boulder to switch
into rain gear. I did the same a little behind. Grr. Would the weather improve
for the morning?

Pete on the West Ridge of Dent d'Herens



A final steep moraine led to a traverse of boulder-strewn slopes, then a short
descent to the hut, where we tried to dry wet gear. I napped for an hour, and
then the weather started to get better. We had a kind of strange dinner. Pete
cracked me up with some jokes about the sausage we were eating. "Climber
fingers," he called them. "Fresh from the glacier," he said, pointing to the
roiling wall of ice cascading over a cliff out the window. The thing was, he was
exactly right. The shape, texture, and even the rather foreign taste of the
sausage was...conducive...to outrageous interpretations!

But if this was strange, we were even more scandalized by breakfast, which
consisted, basically, of two packages of Saltines formed to look like cute
little pieces of toast. Which they weren't. Don't get me wrong, the hut was
nice, the people there was wonderful and friendly. But gosh...maybe it's an
Italian breakfast thing. Or actually, the lack of (any) thing!

Comically, we departed the hut in the 3 am darkness (thankfully with a sky full
of stars!), and didn't know which way to go. I asked a Dutchman, and he pointed
in the opposite direction we expected to go. Finally enough people set off that
way (back down the approach trail for a ways, then left up a moraine) that we
had to conclude this was correct!

We walked through the darkness a long time. We put on harness, crampons and rope
as we reached the glacier, essentially going on autopilot for hours of what was
a pretty standard ascent. We thought we should climb the West Ridge, but if
conditions were poor we would do the Southwest Face. In fact though, it seems
that the West Ridge has really become the normal route now, unlike when my buddy
Georg climbed the peak some years before.

We got into a line of guides and clients for a fixed rope/chain that led up
rotten rocks for about 60 meters to the ridge crest. We climbed through them,
being a little bit aggressive about continuing to move among people who are
standing around a lot. I don't *like* this attitude or atmosphere of stress in
regards to 4000 meter mountains, but I don't like to be stuck either.

The Matterhorn on the right



But once past that, the ridge crest offered excellent climbing! I enjoyed this
part of the climb the most. We moved together, protecting as needed. I was in my
own world a little bit though, because Pete was thinking we should remove
crampons and I just kept going. It's no fun to do moves that feel sketchy and
I'm sorry to have been so oblivious! At least I got some payback later! On the
descent we reversed the ridge without crampons and gosh, it was my turn to feel
sketched out! Everything felt so...slippery?

Once the various ridge towers were completed, we began an interminable climb of
uncomfortably angled snow (45 degrees?) to a final selection of rocks just below
the summit. We commiserated with banal phrases like "...it's so long!", or "Man,
I'm tired!" We were feeling the altitude as this was our first high tour.

The weather began to close in, with strong wind and a long horizontal sweep of
cloud obscuring the summit of the neighboring Matterhorn. The final rock climb
and a few dicey moves on narrow ridge crest were done in strong, cold wind. We
took one or two pictures and started down as quickly as possible.

We kept looking for a turn-off from our long slope onto the Southwest Face and
glacier, but we must have missed it. So we descended the ridge, as mentioned
already, without crampons. Down here the weather was good again, even sunny for
a while.

The sun had the ability to make us smile, and momentarily forget the difficult
weather environment. Looking back a month, I can see this was only the beginning
of a difficult emotional period regarding the weather, and it finally forged a
new understanding in me on how to deal with the problem.

Goodbye, high country!



But while we could smile and laugh, we did!

Cleverly, we'd brought everything with us, so we didn't have to return to the
hut, but could continue straight down the moraine to rejoin our valley
trail. This was a pleasant journey, despite heavy packs and tired feet. We
reached the restaurant of the day before, ordering another lunch, which was
almost as good, but it seemed they'd learned about me and there was now a
rationing policy on the Parmesian cheese.

It started to rain as we made the long mostly flat walk along the lake. I was
dreading this section: mountain boots and long flat roads don't go together very
well! But listening to good music (Family of the Year), and a overt decision to
have a positive attitude worked wonders. By the end, Pete and I were moving very
fast, and if not entirely happy, we at least successfully outraced our fear of
tedium and pain!

Congratulating ourselves on having *fully used* a sub-24 hour weather window, we
now drove back to Geneva through the Mont Blanc tunnel, arriving late and
committing to a wonderful rest day.

* * *

Pete had an excellent day with family, and I enjoyed myself exploring Geneva
(mainly exploring the interior of a coffee shop, actually!). During the day,
continuing to look at more poor forecasts, I resolved to go on a multi-day hike
as a way to exit this antagonistic relationship with the weather. It was taking
away the joy of mountains! Pete and I chatted, and it seemed best to send me off
on this hike, while he would enjoy some family time and then hopefully get some
technical climbing in on the weekend when the weather was slated to improve.

Another wonderful dinner and breakfast with lively conversation, and they sent
me on my way, with a few packs of granola cookies that would fuel my next
adventure with pleasure!

Thank you Pete, thanks Alena! Y'all are great. Until next time, with blue skies
and enough high-pressure weather to give us nosebleeds :).
