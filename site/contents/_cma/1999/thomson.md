With the good weather forecast, I was hoping for a weekend bursting with
mountain climbs! Sadly, Steve was detained at work, so our planned climb of the
West Face of Sloan Peak had to be canceled (this climb *always* seems to get
canceled!). I searched for something I could do on my own, perhaps some
scrambling and rappelling.  I settled on the Snoqualmie Pass area, with a nice
walk up to the Kendall Katwalk, and a climb of Mount Thomson. The Beckey
"Bible" stated I could access Red Mountain from the area, and I hoped to climb
Huckleberry Mountain too. I packed for overnight, needlessly bringing a bivy
sack against non-existent wet weather.


I had also purchased 50 meters of 6 mm static line, for a primitive rappel
setup.

Kris dropped me off at the PCT trailhead at 7:15 am, where I got some 
information
about the old trail to Red Mountain. It was easy to find, and after only
one mile of walking I reached a point that took 2.75 miles to reach had I
taken the long, switch-backing PCT. Happily, I moved along, rising and eventually
working around Kendall Peak on the PCT with great views of Mt. Rainier and
local peaks such as Guye, Snoqualmie and Lundin. I really enjoyed the
stretch of trail from the Kendall Katwalk to Ridge Lake. It looks down on a 
green valley, with bouldery meadows on either side of the trail. Great
views of Mount Thomson.


I got water at Ridge Lake, easily found Bumblebee Pass, and was soon descending
into Thomson's protected basin. Edd's Lake seemed very mysterious and remote
in a hanging valley below. Descending into the basin was difficult due to
fresh snow and ice coating the boulders. Time consuming! But soon I was
back in the sun and marmots eyed me warily from only 5 feet away.


There were two obvious gullies leading up to the east ridge of the peak. The
book advises taking the left gully. Hmm. The left gully looks loose at the
bottom and 5.hard for 20 feet before hitting the ridge. The right gully
looks cleaner, and features a steep heather slope and no rock climbing.
But it seems like you might get stopped by a cliff break in the ridge.
Anyway, the book says to take the left gully. So reluctantly, I took it,
climbing rock, heather, and dirt slopes. Everything was loose, and I
accidentally sent a few loud volleys of stone crashing down into the basin.
Oops!



I moved out of the gully into a low-angled chimney cleaving the right wall
where the rock was more solid. I could see a tree on the ridge 35 feet above.
Switching to rock shoes, I started up a side of the gully wall (the top of the
gully was blocked by a huge, overhanging chockstone), and immediately
realized I wouldn't/shouldn't do this. The rock was vertical with occasional
bulges to navigate around, and a fall would send me into the gully on
a brutal descent. I carefully climbed down, said "forget it, I'm looking
into the right gully whatever the book says!" and began the tedious
work of down-climbing the entire gully.


I was doing this, and noticed a climber in the basin looking up at me.
As I got closer, he waved and suggested a line on the left side of the
gully. I traversed to it as he approached, and started up an exposed
3rd/4th class ramp angling towards the west ridge. Somewhere in here we
introduced ourselves, and David went up to yet another line in the
gully. I gave up on my ramp, as it wound out of sight with dramatic
exposure. I was already a little frazzled!


David was stumped at a 6 foot difficult move that appeared to lead
to easier ground, and I didn't want to try it either. Finally, we both
agreed to down-climb and take the right gully.


This we did, and lo! This gully led to the ridge easily, and then a trail
on steep heather took us to a bracing viewpoint of the north side of the
mountain, complete with snowy ledges and a 1000 foot vertical drop.
Past this, we had more heather, then easy rock scrambling. The route
wound around to the south, then ascended steeply on good rock with an
unneeded handline. We reached a rappel station, then grandly walked
the final 20 feet to the summit. Yes!


We took pictures and reveled in the view. It was good to have a partner
on the scary stuff below, and the additional energy two people can muster
may have helped us persevere in spite of those difficulties. Hey David,
if you are out there, that was fun!


We didn't break out the rope at the rap station, comfortable with the
down-climbing which was nothing like what we experienced in the gully.
I lost points for cracking and grabbing the handline near the bottom of
the stemming crack! With each step down the steep heather I regretted not
bringing hiking poles, as David had wisely done! Monday, my thighs still
ached...


Once in the basin, my ambitious plan to climb Huckleberry Peak seemed
ridiculous. I was pretty beat, so I sat for a few minutes, eating and
drinking water from the trickling snowmelt. It was about 3 pm. I decided
to go ahead on the PCT around and camp below Chikamin Peak, and climb
it the following morning.


Foolishly, I cached my rappel/climbing equipment at the top of Bumblebee
Pass. With lowering energy, I continued on the PCT, finally working my
way around Alaska Mountain to a view of Huckleberry across the valley.
I was low on water, and didn't see how to get any for miles without a
lot of effort. Here, I also realized that the distance to Chickamin
Peak was far greater than I thought! I had to meet Kris at Snoqualmie
Pass at 5:30 pm the next day, and wasn't too sure about walking 14
miles after climbing Chikamin and making it on time!


So, with heavy heart I turned back. My choices for the next day were
now limited to Red Mountain or Lundin Peak. I picked up my cached
gear (the climb up to the Pass was exhausting!), and tiredly built
a camp at Ridge Lake. I was sleeping by the time it was dark.


In the morning I felt much better, and was walking back to the Kendall
Katwalk by 7:15. I met a climber who started from the parking lot at
2:30 by the lake. He headed for the east ridge. Later, I met a pair
going to the west ridge. Shortly before the Katwalk, I left my gear
and headed up steepening slabs and heather, coming to a grand view of
a snowy basin on the other side.  From what I could see, moving along
this ridge to Red Mountain was going to be tough. I climbed down then
up again to a tri-corner ridge crest, then carefully followed the
ridge down towards Red Mountain. The exposure was incredible on the
snowy, shadowed side, where I edged around small gnarled trees. Eventually,
and with some relief the left side angled back, permitting walking on
steep heather. Finally I had to step up to the ridge crest again, and
here learned that I wasn't going any farther. The ridge dropped off to
a low saddle, and there was no way I would try and descend that alone.


Oh well, so for like the 3rd time this weekend I wimped out, working
my way back, and slowly down to the trail via heather and boulders.
It was only 10:30 am, but I realized I was probably done! There weren't any
other grand mountains for me to climb, so I walked back, scrambling up
a subridge of Kendall Peak on the way. Later, I called Kris from the
cell phone, so she could pick me up at 1:15. For the way down, I just
concentrated on the awesome view, stopping to rest often and prolong my
visit to the wilderness. I ran into a thru-hiker, almost finished with his
long journey from Mexico. Lots of people with dogs crowded the lower reaches
of the trail, and the "city-trail" phenomenon occurred. This is when people
start looking straight ahead on the trail and not acknowledging you when
they pass! I make sure to give a hearty "hello" which just irritates them!
I wonder, do they think it increases the "wilderness experience" to bring
city rules to the trails? The eye that perpetually seeks to avoid contact,
hmm. I've noticed that 2 of the 3 need to be satisfied for the effect
to fade: 

*  Greater than 1 hour drive from town
*  Greater than 3000 feet hiked up
*  Greater than 4 miles in

So Kris picked me up, and we had a hilarious evening at the final Almost
Live! taping, a great (now defunct) Seattle comedy program.

Lesson: trust your instincts, not some book, even if it is the "Bible!"
