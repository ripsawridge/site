### Morning hike up Buchstein
_March, 2007_

Josef and I took advantage of some sunny weather to go hiking in the morning
instead of the boring ol' climbing gym. We hiked up Buchstein in 1.5 hours. I
consider that pretty good, even though it's fifteen minutes more than my time
last summer. You see, Kris and I ate at a restaurant called *Geniessen im
Dunkeln* the night before (in English it means "Enjoyment in the Dark"), and
even though it was pitch black all around me while eating, I managed to drink
many glasses of wine! So despite shaking from the DTs, it was worth getting up
early for the amazing scenery. It doesn't look like winter at all up there!

Josef took a nice picture.
