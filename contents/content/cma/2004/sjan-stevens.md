### Steven's Pass Skiing, Jan 18, 2004

Kris and I went skiing Sunday. It was snowing moderately, probably
good because conditions were icy before. We did the green run a few
times, then a blue run (Broadway), then she had a lesson while I went
to the "backside." I went down Gemini, then Orion, which was my
first black diamond run by myself. No falls! Although it tired me
out. I screamed back to the front because her lesson was over. We ate
lunch, then I skied down "Showcase" - I really like that run, I
think it is my favorite blue run, as the angle is constant and steep
enough for a great view of the area below. We did Rock n Blue and then
Skyline together, which was really fun - she had already improved! But
now she was beat, so she skied to the car and I got in two more quick
runs. First "Parachute 1," this was too steep and narrow for me to
do well. I nearly fell on a broken beer bottle in the middle of the
run! Then I did the black diamond variation to "International,"
which was great.
