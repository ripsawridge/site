Ptarmigan Ridge
-----------

Kris and I spent the weekend hiking at Mt. Baker in beautiful weather. 
We arrived at Artists Point in late afternoon, and hiked to a viewpoint 
on Ptarmigan Ridge. We watched the sunset and took pictures, having lots
of fun sitting around waiting for the sunset, playing with rocks
and hugging. I think my favorite picture that Kris took is of the
valley in the evening light. Pink sky above, dark valley below, but
with a magical mist hovering in it.

Descending 
in the dark was interesting, especially crossing a snowfield. Kris was
worried at first on the near-frozen neve, but the angle was low enough
that we could hop from bulge to bulge on the steeper parts.
We had the moon to keep us company. At the parking lot, a consortium
of astronomers were setting up telescopes and drinking alcoholic
beverages. They invited us to look at Saturn and a few other things.
That was awesome! We left them to their revelry and drove back to 
Bellingham to find a cheap motel room.



Skyline Divide
-----------

The next day, we hiked up 
the Skyline Divide. I had been entranced by pictures of the long ridge
in the hiking guide book. We drove up a steep gravel road to reach
the trail-head. The hike up out of the timber seemed long, but we
were visited by the most outrageous band of "camp robbers" we'd ever
seen. If they saw us at a higher switchback, they would zoom up through
the trees, twittering and convulsing with anticipation 
they were nearly driven mad! We finally reached the glorious
meadow country, and let the birds land on us for some snacks.
Kris was sleepy, so I left her to a nice, sunny nap in the grass.
I jogged 
along to the high point of the ridge. Nice shots of the north side 
of Mt. Baker were available. Of course, on both of these hikes, I wanted
to continue straight to the mountain and climb it. Ptarmigan Ridge
would be an especially nice approach. (Doxey Kemp did this summer 2002,
but the bergschrund was too wide to cross on the upper mountain).

I rejoined Kris and napped with her awhile. Warm
sun, high meadows and dry ground are an especially delicious combination
for denizens of western Washington!



At the car we discovered a flat tire. "Easily fixed," I thought as
I began removing the bolts. One of the bolts required a
"key," which I affixed between the tire iron and said bolt. 
With a bit of muscle to turn the bolt and key, I heard a snap,
and saw a portion of the bolt fall to the ground. With the bolt broken,
there was no way to remove the tire!



How could a steel bolt break? What a disaster!



We called a tow truck driver in Bellingham. He said he could tow us for
$250.00, and we'd have to stay overnight in Bellingham and miss work on
Monday so a repair shop could bash the bolts into pieces.



A bystander (we now had a small crowd, most of whom would watch sadly
for a minute, shake their heads and walk away) suggested a can of air
which could fill a tire. Good idea! Someone else had one! But it was
mostly empty, and didn't fill the tire enough to make it down the gravel
road.



So now we asked people coming out of the trail for canned air. No such luck.
As we were getting ready to sadly call the tow truck, a huge white pickup
truck drove up. The driver had canned air! With the 7 inch buckskin knife
strapped to his belt, he gave us his can of air and drove away a hero,
because it was sufficient to get us all the way home to Woodinville.
