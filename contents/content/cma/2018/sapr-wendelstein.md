Barbara, Mara and I hiked up and down on a leisurely Sunday. It was great! But wow, pretty
crowded. We had a nice talk in the meadow after a drink at the house. We left the summit alone
this time, as the vast hordes of people were a bit much. Mara was maximally cute, and so was
my girl.

Mara just found some water.

Barbara didn't like this wet terrain.

Magnificent Mara, in the prime of her life.

Tired ol' Mara, sleeping all evening.
