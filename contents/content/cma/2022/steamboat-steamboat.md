First a walk on the highway for a bit, then into the trees on good trail
heading north.

I'd figured out the bus system, and was happy that I could spend a last
night in town and know that I'd have a cheap bus ride in the morning to
Muddy Pass. I was also excited to be travelling north again. The Giardia
infection seemed to be under control, too (sort of).

Soon I was walking the road for a few miles, then left it for a smaller
road leading to Rabbit Ears Pass, next to a campground and lake (Dumont
Lake). I was able to use a privy at the lake, what a luxury!

Looking back south on Lake Elmo, one of many attractive lakes here.

From here, the trail goes through pleasant if somewhat nondescript country
in a meandering way north. I passed many lakes, like Round Lake, Little
Lost Lake and Grizzly Lake. The land slowly climbed higher, finally
reaching parkland above thicker forest in the afternoon.

I passed a powerline and radio tower, then reached Buffalo Pass and
Summit Lake with aching feet in the early evening. I thought about
camping at Summit Lake, but it seemed quite troublesome, with a system
of monies, envelopes, notices, deposit boxes. So after filling water
at the stream, I wandered up and into the Mount Zirkel Wilderness
to spend the night. I found a relatively flat spot between snow patches
in the forest, and quickly zipped myself up in the tent to escape
the evening mosquitoes.

It would be my last night sleeping out of doors.

A beautiful journey over Lost Ranger Peak.

I was up early and on my way in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness.
It was nice that it hadn't rained during the night, a nice contrast with
the weather in the previous stage.
The crest is also called the Park Range. It was nice to walk along it, though
there were quite a few snow patches, sometimes rather thick. Climbing up
onto a patch then back down reminded me somewhat of the San Juans.

An early morning walk along the crest. Mount Ethel is in the distance.
I'll skirt the summit on the right side making for the still higher Lost
Ranger Peak.

Circle-K is out early, too.

Dropping into a shallow valley, now facing somewhat west.

Circle-K and I.

Circle-K passed me in here. She was planning to walk all the way to
the Wyoming border today. Wow! I'd last seen her in Salida at the interesting
little garage where hikers are allowed to sleep. I made sure to get a
picture with her, because I was becoming increasingly sure that I was
going to leave the trail.

There were a mix of reasons. I wrote about them on the blog (["I'm going
home soon"](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/07/im-going-home-soon.html),
and ["What was it?"](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/07/what-was-it.html)). The bear problem
loomed really large for me at the time, but really, I was
simply exhausted and missing my meditation practice. I just wasn't looking
forward to the upper half of the trail.

If I were to do it again, I'd say two things:

1. Plan for periods of no enthusiasm, and have a few strategies to deploy
   that help. Probably something like a longer town stay with some luxuries.
2. Hike less per day to ensure meditation time. In fact, just never skip
   meditation. Once you lose the habit, it's very hard to regain it. But
   the habit itself keeps you happy, so it's a serious requirement.

My problem was that I'd simply never encountered 1., and it was so tempting
to use every hour to move north, that by the time I realized the importance
of the loss of meditation, I just wanted to come home to repair the deficit.

Regarding the bear concern, I think you just have to trust the odds, provided
you never eat where you camp. I'm simply too near to a long hospital stay
(2 years before) to be sanguine about those odds. Long hospital stays are
no fun, and even the slight risk of that happening again felt like too much.

So, as I walked I realized it was a kind of goodbye hike. The country was
gorgeous. Granite domes and alpine parks. Not very spiky, rather a broad
and forgiving high country whose big elevation changes are masked by their
slow approach and diminishment. Lost Ranger Peak and Mount Ethel looked very
far away, but very appealing.

A nice view of Lake Elbert, with an unnamed mesa-like peak behind.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220710_112752_MP.jpg %}
Somehow this country reminds me of the Trinity Alps in California (I only
know it through pictures).

Looking southwest to the country of Horse Thief Park and Steamboat Springs
behind in the haze.

Looking ahead to the giant of the region, Lost Ranger Peak.

On the slopes of the giant, with the snowy northern tresses of Ethel Peak
on the left.

Looking generally east, with the peaks of my previous stage getting some
mid-day showers.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04787.jpg %}
Into the mysterious north. The viewshed here is enormous, with Mount Zirkel
and the small but sharp Sawtooth Range, avoided by the CDT which sticks
to lower country on the left (west) side.

Truly, the country was gorgeous. Maybe the name influenced me a lot,
but Lost Ranger Peak was a special place. Looking down to the parks in the
north, the thin spruce trees gave me a wistful feeling, and I thought of
winter up here.

I'd finally become part of this sort of continental landscape I always
wondered about. I knew it. And now it was time to turn decisively home.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04791.jpg %}
I'll leave the crest in the green snow-bespeckled park to turn west into
the valley.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04793.jpg %}
Still, the crest beckons...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04795.jpg %}
I took a lot of pictures here. I liked the way the green parkland slowly
became more defined/detailed.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04797.jpg %}
Getting closer...

A look back up to Lost Ranger.

Now I'm down from the parkland and into a section of burned forest west of
the crest.

Lush and Pecarino came hopping along the trail. We walked together for
a while. I was flagging in afternoon heat in the burnt forest, and Lush was
a good conversation partner to keep me moving. I was enjoying myself, but
when I think back on our conversation I see that I was constantly raising
questions like "why shouldn't we live at depth instead of skimming the
surface?" And getting answers back like "I don't think so much about it,
I just live." And those answers didn't sit with me.

In truth, I was arguing with myself and Lush was (sorry!) kind of an
observer to the process. I was deciding that it is better to live at depth,
and that depth required me to leave. After an hour or so, I was pretty sure:
reach the Seedhouse Campground, and make my way back to Steamboat Springs,
which will be much easier than trying to get a ride from Encampment Wyoming
back to Colorado. Some people walking by had told me that. I don't know
if they were correct, but my mind siezed on that.

All at once I was sick of sleeping out. In fact sick of the whole thing...

So when a car drove by on the road about 2 miles from the Seedhouse Campground
I stuck out my thumb. Let's go, I thought!

The couple in the car had to arrange things a bit to give me space in the back
seat, but soon we were underway.

They brought me to their campsite. I said thanks and went back to the road
wondering if I should sleep here tonight and try to hitch further in the
morning. I even toyed with the idea of continuing. I'd reach the border in
early afternoon of another day of walking.

Nah! When a truck drove by, I hitched.

This got me to a little restaurant on the road to Steamboat. I ate some snacks
here, probably bought some ice cream. Then another hitch got me to town.

After one more stay at the same hotel, I was up early for the bus to Denver.
The next day I was on a plane to Oklahoma City to visit Cathy and Tamara.

Back to regular life with my sister, the local game warden, and an
embarrassed cow.

"Well, I'm back."
