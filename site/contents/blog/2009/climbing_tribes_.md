Somehow I missed this funny article a few years ago in the NYT. The author,
Will Gadd, is a really amazing ice and mixed ice/rock climber. Here is
a segment on "my tribe:"
  
  

>   
> The Trad tribe (short for traditional climber) believes that the bolts
> common to sport climbing are sacrilegious. A common trad bumper sticker
> reads, "Sport climbing is NEITHER!" Trad climbers use only removable or
> "clean" safety equipment. Beards, wool, third-hand clothing and Volkswagen
> vans are still common among the most holy of the Trads, but these climbers
> are not to be confused with mere hippies, although the priests of Trad
> climbing use the term "climbing bum" as an honorific. The Trads are the
> most evangelical and fundamentalist with their beliefs, which are well-documented
> in frequent ranting letters to the editors of the climbing magazines.
