### Tiger Mountain, February 11, 2005

I hiked up the Cable Line Trail to West Tiger 3 this morning. A friend told
me it was a good route to train for trail running. I mostly walked it, and
still emerged really weak at the top 42 minutes later. Still, that was the
fastest I'd ever hiked up 2000 feet! Muttering softly to myself and drooling
somewhat, I descended quietly.


I decided to quit writing up Cougar Mountain stuff here, it is just too
close to home, and I guess Tiger is too. I am not going to the mountains
lately (or for a while), so little will happen in these pages. I'm just
getting to know the local hills and trails around Issaquah, Bellevue, Redmond.
