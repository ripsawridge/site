A fun hike up the steep way from the road. New blowdowns on
the leaf-strewn trail which feels quite abandoned. However there
was a fench around an enclosure shortly before the trail meets
the road. On the way down, I took the other steep way further
south by the Felixalm. That trail is becoming extremely
unmaintained...I only followed it by memory and a slight
indentation in the run of the dry leaves underfoot.

4.5 hours up and down.
