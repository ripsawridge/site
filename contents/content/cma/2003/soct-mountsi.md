<h3>Mount Si, October ??, 2003</h3>

Carlos P. and I hiked up Mount Si for an early morning exercise. It was really neat,
because on top of the haystack we were far above the clouds. A great "cloud sea" lay below us.
It was Carlos' first trip up there, I'm glad I could share this popular hike with him.
