### Naunspitze
_June 11, 2023_

Hiked up with some water and a helmet to climb the grade II+ Southwest Ridge,
a nice little alternative to the normal way on the Naunspitze. To make up
for hiking with such a light pack, I resolved to leave the poles at home.
My goodness, this makes my legs work so much harder, but I know it's good
for me. I really have to balance time hiking with poles with time hiking
without poles. My legs are much stronger this way. Though, if I did it all
the time I suppose my knees would hurt.

At the hut below the summit, I finished the fantastic book by Andrew Klaven, "[The Truth and Beauty](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Beauty-Englands-Greatest-Understanding-ebook/dp/B09MH85H3S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1686563086&sr=8-1)."
