### Schafreuter hike
<i>June, 2011</i>

I hiked up Schafreuter, taking 1:40 from the car to reach the summit. Really beautiful view from this peak! I looked at the northern ramparts of the Karwendel Range as clouds slowly gathered. Lots of sun too. I went up on the north side, and down to the Tölzer Hütte on the south, then doubled back north on a mostly level trail on the west side of the mountain. Oh my god, there were so many flies on cow pies that I thought I was in a 1970s Italian horror movie (ever see Gates of Hell?). It was disgusting. Glad to be done with that side trail! Hiked down to the car for a 3.5 hour trip, 1200 meters elevation gain/loss.
