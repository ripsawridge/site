Christian and I climbed the Jochberg Right Gully (WI3), an entertaining
set of N pitches (N=6? something like that), on a mountain I'd wanted to
explore for a while. We soloed up the first steps, then used about 25 meters
of the rope to belay sections, and also travel in coils for the bits of
walking in between ice steps.

Near the end was a long section of climbing up a 30 degree snow couloir
with interesting rock walls. Then an interesting "mixed" step on ice and
rock to get above it. Finally, the climb ended with some more mixed moves,
including fun frozen mud hummocks to reach the ridge crest. I dropped my
pack here and we made the hike up to the summit in brilliant sunshine.
The views south into the Karwendel were great.

The hike down was extremely icy, but we suffered only a few prattfalls.
Thanks for a great time, Christian!
