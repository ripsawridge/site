### Schüsselkarspitze attempt
<b>May 24, 2010</b>

Finally, good weather in the Alps! Alexander had an ambitious plan to storm the
high "kamm" of the Wetterstein. We hiked up the Puittal to find heavy snow at
the base of the mountain. Another hour of step kicking got us to the base of
the Messner/Sint route. Along the way we were entertained by dramatic falls of
snow, including a big chunk of cornice from the summit. Gulp.

Alexander led out on a mighty attempt to storm the first pitch. But the rock
was weeping with water from many snowpatches, making things very insecure. The
climb was completely on gear and there were a few tense moments. But he was
able to downclimb from his high point. We skedaddled out of there before more
avalanche and rockfall could ruin the rest of the day.

Oh well, we got some good hiking in, and the route does look super. Here is
