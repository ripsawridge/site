### Heuberg
_March 13, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up on a beautiful day.

### Wildbarren
_March 6, 2021_

With Jong on a snowy day.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

Night hike to the summit and back.

### Wildbarren

Wonderful day, up steeply and down the secondary way to the same trailhead.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

With Barbara and a small dog -- much fun!

### Wildbarren

Up steeply, but this time traversing around to the west and the dramatic sub-summit.
From there, the ridge is easily followed (game trail?) to join the trail to the summit near the small pretend-chapel.
Down the secondary steep way. Difficult, muddy time in the forest on steep, icy slope with ice under leaves.

### Heuberg

Night hike to the summit and back, thence to sleep in mountains.

### Kranzhorn (partial)

I hiked up on the german side of Kranzhorn. Very interesting trails!
