### Zwölferkopf recon
_July, 2006_

I had a few hours one Sunday morning to check out the start of a climb on the
Zwölferspitze which rises above Garmisch. I hiked up through forest to a long
steep trail in scree to reach old snow below the ridge. One couloir went left,
another right. I was searching for the start of the rock climbing, but made a
mistake and roughly followed the couloir on the right. Continually, there were
little plaques embedded in the side of the mountain, and I thought "ah that
must be the start of the route." But no, they were markers for when someone had
died. Many were very old. After more scrambling, I realized my route would
reach a saddle, with still a long ways to the top. So I descended carefully. I
met and warned another party heading up, but they roped up and seemed to be
making the same error I did. Oh well, they had the full day to puzzle it out. I
meanwhile hastened away.

Some fellows looking for the start of the Northeast Ridge rock climb. I could
tell them it's not to the right, but they went over there anyway. :D. July,
2006.
