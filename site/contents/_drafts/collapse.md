_A friend of mine wrote me a letter, sharing thoughts about the climate and how worrisome it all is.
I agreed completely. I've also been thinking about this for a couple years now._

_I've listened to many voices on this topic. I'm nobody special, my only qualification to talk is that
I have made a lot of time to learn about this, and I publish my own blog so ya can't stop me, hee hee!_

## WARNING! This information can ruin your day, week, month or year!

If you want to learn about this topic, then recognize that you are entering a zone where you may not
understand your own reactions. The [Kübler-Ross Stages of Grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kübler-Ross_model)
provide a good model of what to expect within yourself. You may well already be in one of these stages,
because information about collapse is all around us. Many of us are already worrying about it without
really being able to put our finger on what's wrong. I believe I spent years in *denial*, and I could only
begin to exit that stage when I began to cultivate a spiritual life. It was essential that I confronted
my fear of death. Only then could I consider facts more clearly.

I say "more" clearly instead of clearly, because as a human being, I'm riddled with biases, and will
always be. Some of my more important biases in this space are likely to be

1. White male, hence priviledged in many ways that still remain hidden to me.
1. Well into middle-age, and now separated from my wife. This represents a significant failure in life.
I am definitely primed to see "the down side" of things. This is, I feel, the strongest reason to
discount what I have to say, and I wouldn't blame you. If you read further, remember that a man who
failed at something big may well take comfort in the idea that _everything_ is going to fail. It's
been pointed out that many of the people harping about collapse are older white men!
1. I have a nervous disposition...I'm often scanning the exits of any situation and thinking about
how to be safe. I was bullied a lot as a kid, and I became distrustful of people. This may lead
to a constrained view on the possibility of people in general to amaze us.
1. There are many more, doubt it not!

Despite our biases, we need to think our way forward. So, back to the stages of grief. I expressed *anger*
for years, primarily against what I called über-capitalism, or unapologetic neo-liberalism. I read
plenty of Chris Hedges and nodded along enthusiastically. Now, however, I see that our corporations are
just the front line of our fundamental shared belief: *that we can "grow" as much as we want. That
the sky is the limit. That we are free, that we can do anything once we put our mind to it, and that
we are going to the stars!*

The moment we, _en masse_, moderate those beliefs into a form that accepts the truth of limits
and of connection between all things...then the character of our corporations will lose the "sharp edge"
that we can so clearly see is destructive.

We spend a lot of time blaming them. And then we go to work and "become" them.

Other people might express anger from the _right_ instead of the _left_. Whole books are being written
about that too, of course.

Ask yourself this: why are so many so angry people right now in the world?

I believe that what we see in the culture is the messy swirl of processing these emotions. The next stages
are a bit quieter, those of *bargaining*, *depression*, and *acceptance*. Personally, I've made it
through, at least for today.

### Another problem

This information is dangerous for another reason. Some people are very conspiracy-minded, and many of
the details of the collapse argument can serve as off-ramps into tin-foil-hat land. We are
seeing the internet do a great job right now of amplifying and legitimizing such ideas ("chem-trails,"
the Rothchilds, etc.). But collapse is multi-causual, it's expression
involves complex tipping points, feedback loops, retrenchment, restoration, and just a whole slew
of effects that rebound on each other through time. It's bad enough without getting hung up on
the notion that some group of evil busy-bodies are in control of the whole thing.

Nobody can control this. What is happening is emergent from the scale and complexity of what we create
all together, from our deepest motivations. If someone was in control, that would actually be good
news.

It means this great evil busy-body just might change his mind and put us on a better track, _amirite?!_

## An important note

I want to communicate with love for anybody who is listening. If my words hurt you, then I am sorry...
it is my fault on some level. I have failed to speak with sufficient love, empathy and respect for
you, who are reading this. You, who are listening to me.

I am a flawed human being, but I like who I am. I think it's probably similar for you. I think you
are more capable than you know. If anything good comes out of this situation we are in, it is likely
to come from you.

I am honored that you came to sit here, and listen to me.

This thought is far more important than any of the information that follows. This thought is the
melody and the chords. If you lose the thread of empathy when reading, then I have grown tired and
I have lost you. Don't read further. What flows from love is trust and humor. I would rather you
know me only as someone who smiles and says nothing than as a man full of facts which he uses to
hurt others and himself.

## Limits to Growth

In the early 1970s, scientists built the first rigorous computer model around our use of
finite and renewable resources, combined with projections of our growing population.
The news was alarming, and created a real stir. The "Business as Usual" of their model predicted
major problems around 2030. The authors who are still alive, and who have continually
revised the model say we are right on schedule. The work, published in "[The Limits to Growth](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)"
in 1972, was heavily ridiculed and only recently received
a more thoughtful reception. In an article from [_The Guardian_ in 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse), 
we read:

> The task was very ambitious. The team tracked industrialisation, population,
> food, use of resources, and pollution. They modelled data up to 1970, then
> developed a range of scenarios out to 2100, depending on whether humanity took
> serious action on environmental and resource issues. If that didn’t happen, the
> model predicted “overshoot and collapse” – in the economy, environment and
> population – before 2070. This was called the “business-as-usual” scenario.
> 
> The book’s central point, much criticised since, is that “the earth is
> finite” and the quest for unlimited growth in population, material goods etc
> would eventually lead to a crash.

The article gathers current data and concludes that it checks out very closely with the
original predictions.

There are many reasons to dislike these conclusions. To talk about the danger of overpopulation
risks going against religious beliefs and raises the spectre of totalitarian population
control and even mass murder or genocide. To talk about the need to limit growth goes
against government and corporate policy and invites ridicule from all sides. But not talking
about uncomfortable or delicate subjects is a sure way not to solve your problems, but to
pile them up for later.

We are now in the "later."

## Our inability to understand exponential growth

> “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand
> the exponential function.”
> --Albert A. Bartlett

I was born in 1971. Since then, our world population has doubled, from [3.78 billion to 7.4 billion people](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/).
This doubling occured with a "moderate looking" growth rate of between 1 and 1.9%. How can this happen?

Math.

Al Bartlett was a physics professor at the University of Colorado, and dedicated the latter part of his life
to explaining the nature of exponential growth in an accessible and good-natured way. He attacked the mindset
of constant, steady growth in all human endeavors, and believed that population growth in the USA was leading
to misery, both for the people and their environment.

"Prove it," you'll say. I suggest getting a pencil and paper and watching his famous presentation. At the
very least, it'll remind you of university and some of your better instructors.

It's also the case that the earth has lost [half of it's wildlife](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf) since
I was born. I don't even have to recite the facts about the depletion of ocean life and the warming of the atmosphere, because you already
know these things. I don't have to point out that our political systems are
getting more volatile as they whipsaw between pro- and anti- immigration
policy, with charges of racism on the one side, and people getting used to
being called racists on the other.

Population, both in sheer numbers and in their multiplicative effect on
resource use when that population lives in a first-world country is the
driving issue for all the rest. In fact.

## Climate Change is just a side-effect

We know that burning fossil fuel is heating up the planet.
Why, then, are we burning fossil fuels? Because of evil oil companies? Partly, I suppose.
But the primary reason must be that we consider fossil fuels useful as a society.
I am surrounded by plastic, which come from fossil fuels. I'm in a warm building
in the middle of winter, wearing a t-shirt. This likely comes from coal, or maybe
Russian natural gas...piped over long distances and maintained with an infrastructure
of trucks, heavy equipment, and roads.

For lunch today I ate salmon and a fresh salad. Neither of these ingredients come from
anywhere close to me. It takes a vast global built infrastructure to make this
happen.  This is great -- we are marvellously ingenious! But it's unlikely to
be able to change away from fossil fuel dependence very quickly.

The size of the population matters, and the size of their impact. Someone in America
uses twice as much energy as someone in Europe, due to more driving and air-conditioning.
And someone in Europe uses still many times more than someone in Africa.

Often, if people finally reach agreement that population is a thing worth talking
about, there is a turning away from it again based on the idea that it's impossible
to talk about without endorsing hideous and coercive "solutions."

Some people say the problem is in the third world, where population growth rates are higher
than 1%. Other people say the problem is in the first world, where the growth rate is
much less, but the impact of each person is many times greater.

Like many things, the answer here is "yes, and." That is...they are both right.
As a first-worlder, it makes sense for me to "care more" about getting to zero
growth in the first world. People in the third world are paying disproportionately for the
emissions from the first world, anyway. I'd probably better leave them the heck alone
as they have many problems to deal with!

At the same time, what I would say to people who live in the third world is that their
populations are growing and aspiring to a first world lifestyle. They will end up in
a difficult situation in which they can't adequately care for their populations anymore
due to constraints on water and fuel.

Secondly, in all parts of the world, fights can break out when shared resources are no longer
enough. Growing populations side by side along a national border might have no problem with
each other at all, but when access to a key river is important for life, competition and
conflict can change things very, very quickly.

I am talking about this problem of population not because I like to make people uncomfortable,
but because I don't want any human being on this planet to end up sending their children
to be soldiers in a war for water.

Better to talk about having less children, now.

Notice how quickly we got away from climate change here. Now, that is an enormous looming
problem! But it's clear to me that even if we didn't have that problem we'd already be
victims of our own success.

Where do problems come from?

From solutions.

## We won't be able to turn this ship around

Our monetary system is based on debt, which requires profit to pay back.
The "weight" of existing obligations put a very real brake on changes
to that system, despite growing misery caused by unjust distribution.
That would have to be fixed.

The oil-based food and transportation system would have to be overhauled
in order to stop burning fossil fuels. In places like Europe there is
plenty of goodwill and excitement about this, but we'll need coal for
electricity for a long time. Happily, many cities were built before the
age of the automobile so they are walkable/ridable. But a "just-in-time"
inventory system prevails and is profitable. Whereas, in the USA, there
is active hostility to any measure that "looks like" something hippies
would like to do, and therefore such measures won't be taken while the
culture war rages. Tribalism is already impeding the chances of progress
there.

It's been suggested by Kunstler that riverine economies of barge and tugboat
can reappear in forgotten towns of the northeast and middle-west.
This is a post-collapse notion, but it's worth thinking about now because
collapse may be long, slow and uneven. Events may transpire that convince
people to begin shifting to wood and water for fuel and transport. However,
our current population would swamp any such systems should they try to
crowd in. I think this is an idyll that may or may not occur after populations
dropped by half.

For me, Zen study grew out of that realization. When the news is so bad, it's important to let go and really hold onto the present.
I'm not talking about fatalism, but about being relaxed and not tense as we drift down the stream.
To retain honor for life and resist hating anyone --> we were born into this, and sure, we deserve some guilt, but it's not our fault as individuals.
I want to keep my honor until the end and be ready for death when it comes.

But this is a process you have to go through...here are the facts as I see them:

* Scientists are conservative, and they know that the news they have threatens
  our economic model. So they become very deferential about speaking truth to
  power.
* Our unsustainable growth in population is behind all of this. First world
  people outstrip the carrying capacity of their environments more from the
  large impact each individual has. And third world people outstrip it due to
  high numbers. Governments should have had free family planning and birth
  control pills available 30+ years ago to have had any hope of saving the
  global civilization. It's nice to think that it's not too late...
* Oil is very important in this story. It's the fuel for the incredible growth
  we've had. It is now too expensive to extract, and oil companies are losing
  money. But if they raise prices, then people park their trucks, and then more
  money is lost. If they lower prices, they go out of business. We are all in a
  trap.
* Our food is effectively made of oil...the fertilizer, the trucking the crops
  to stores, the global supply chains...will we succeed in changing to locally
  based organic food production? That production will have much lower yield,
  and we already struggle to feed people.
* "The problem isn't the amount of food, it's the distribution of it." People
  like to say that...and there is truth to it. But let's say that is the whole
  truth. In our political climate, what chance do we have of coming together
  and building a world where food goes exactly to those who need it? We didn't
  manage this so far. How can it be wise to think we will in some "future"
  date? Distribution will always be unfair and distorted by greed and
  complexity. The solution? Don't participate in vast and complex distribution
  networks. Have your food nearby, in your garden, or the woods.
* Scientists estimate the carrying capacity of the earth to be between 1 and 2
  billion people. We are almost 8 billion, and now we use up 1 "whole" earth
  every 6 months...we are cutting deeply into our reserves with water, mineral
  resources, oil, ocean life, and the remaining carbon budget. In my lifetime,
  the population of the planet doubled, while the mass-by-weight of wild
  animals was cut in half. The takeaway? We are only a part of a whole system,
  and what happens to the system happens to us. We only like to think we are
  apart from it and special.
* Our economic system is actually insane. It pretends to offer infinite growth
  on a finite planet. The monetary system is a pyramid scheme that creates debt
  out of thin air, and then asks that it be paid back "with interest." That
  interest is profit, and profit has to come from somewhere. It comes from our
  rivers and lakes, from our dead forests and polluted oceans. From people
  without power or knowledge who work like slaves. Anyone who speaks against
  this system, against "growth," will be discredited very quickly.


## Joseph Tainter's work

Joseph Tainter wrote a great book about civilizational collapse. His theory is
interesting. He says that civilizations grow by solving their problems.
They solve them by adding complexity. For example...people live too long and
run out of money. No problem, we create a retirement system. This is quite
complex! But then new problems arise. One by one, we solve the problems...but
there is a cost --> things get too complex and expensive, and ultimately it's
harder and harder to live *inside* the system. People start falling out in
large numbers. But then the burdens of the complexity fall more on those
remaining inside. Which causes more to fall out. It's clear that we are
experiencing this with rising levels of homelessness and drug addiction. For
the first time, it's a *global* civilization. As a civilization goes over the
cliff, there is a mad scramble for resources that destroys everything within
reach. The good thing is, books are not valuable, so they'll be left alone if
they aren't burned for fuel.

* The civilization can never again reach the same height of technology on this planet. We've mined all the metals...to reach them now requires big technology and machines, all of which require massive amounts of fossil fuels. The remaining fossil fuels are deep in the ocean and very hard to get. Therefore, whatever comes after will be much less technical. Economies based on wood fuel, scrounging for scrap metal and (one day far from now when the oceans recover) fishing...that is the "best" we'll achieve. Personally I think that's fine. We've proven that if we get more power than that, we fail to understand how to use it. For example, we built enormous ships that scraped the ocean floor for profit, and now we wonder why there are no fish.

* Humans will survive, but in small bands. Civilizations are made of stone, of books, law and organized violence. It'll be a long time, if ever until that returns.
* In some places on the globe collapse will be fast, and other places much slower. If you have a simple lifestyle f, you don't "fall" as far. You also are more likely to live in a lifestyle where you know your neighbors, where your family is closer, and where people are poorer, therefore used to asking for help and sometimes getting it. Those of us (like me) high in the "tower" of civilization have little chance because our networks of community and family are threadbare. We became individuals first, and members of a community second, third or even at all.
