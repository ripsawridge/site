### Index Climbing, June 3, 2004
Carlos had never been climbing outside, so I took him to Index to climb
Great Northern Slab. He did very well on the climbing. On the last pitch, I
chose to follow a line of 3 bolts on the left of the slab rather than my usual
"pilgrim's progress" up a shallow crack on the right to the trees. The bolts
were fun, probably about 5.7 or so in difficulty. For Carlos, untutored in
slab climbing, this was the hardest part. He worked mightily to master the
moves, eventually arriving at the little forest that marks the top of the climb.
We met cc.com friends "Greg W" and "Snugtop" here, teaming up for a double
rope rappel down Velvasheen to the iron bolts. Alas! the ropes were stuck
fast somehow. We executed some shinanigans to eventually free them and
continue our descent. Another great evening at Index!
