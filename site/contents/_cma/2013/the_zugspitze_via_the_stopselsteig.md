Danno and I had the day free, which was cool, despite a somewhat miserable
forecast. "Be prepared to hike in drizzle!" we told ourselves. Among several
different ideas, we chose a moderately ambitious one: to climb the Zugspitze
from the west, passing the Wiener Neustaetter Huette and getting on the
Stopselsteig to the summit. This is a fairly easy klettersteig, as long
as the snow isn't too troublesome.

We were hiking around 8 am, in dense fog. But it didn't take long to get
above it, and we already felt rewarded to climb above a "cloud sea" and
have wide visibility of the cliffs above us. We were on roads and ski trails
of the Zugwald, stopping often to verify our location on the map. It's
so easy to get lost down low on hikes without good signage and several
junctions, especially when most of the journey is on roads in dense forest.

But eventually we climbed into a _latschen-gurtel_ above the mature
trees. The _Riffelwaende_ cliffs were above, and we were making for
the line of the Ehrwald Zugspitzebahn, which occasionally sent a cable
car up or down. The trail climbed through cliffs with cable protection
and we entertained ourselves by resurrecting a character from previous
hikes, who we now gave a name: Silas Ezikiel Monroe. This guy comes from
southern aristocratic stock and is loosely based on the sniper from _Saving Private Ryan_,
one Private Daniel Jackson, Charlie Company, played by the actor Barry
Pepper. Especially when he offers obscure bible quotations! We had great
fun developing this character further, finding that it's easy to put words
in his mouth. He has a curious habit of praising before he damns, for example:

> I am not unsympathetic to the aims of the new immigrants to our great
> nation, coming as they do in vast number across the sea from the stinking
> cities of Southern Europe. Indeed, their desire to rise above the squalor
> to which they have long accustomed themselves bodes well for their future
> in this country.

_Ouch_.

Silas lives in an indeterminate time, probably coming into his prime between
the World Wars. By the time they are finished, he sees decay in all directions.
He admires grit and determination, but will see it in places that have
fallen out of fashion today, such as imperial adventure. He is an unabashed
racist, damning huge swaths of humanity with the language of discrimination
that "merely" seeks a higher ideal. It goes without saying that his own
race is atop the heap through countless civilizations (but he says it anyway).
Key terms for him are:

* Hubris
* Deportment
* Pride of place
* Unease
* Disgust
* Benevolence

and so on, ever alternating disgust with the soiled world around him,
with expressions of nobility and tolerance for that which nonetheless is
unpleasant to his taste. Silas hunts of course, but honorably.

Anyway, it's fun to flesh out a character.

We were surprised to find the Wiener Neustaetter Huette open, but that
didn't stop us from buying a coffee and some cake. 30 minutes later, we
continued up in a vast _Kar_ (basin surrounded by walls) to the beginning
of the _Stopselsteig_ on the left (north) side. Another party was negotiating
the great crevice and cave that marked the start, following the cable and
ladders up to a broader realm of terraces 200 meters above.

Danno and I started up, enjoying the climbing moves. The "crux" of the
route seemed to be on the last of several ladders, squeezing you rather
awkwardly into a crack on the left which is finally escaped with a move
to the right on a broad ledge. From here we walked and occasionally scrambled
up towards the great object of mystery on this route: the abandoned lift
station!

Like something out of _Lost_, it hulks, looking oddly out of place:
a 4 story building with boarded windows, suggestive of a vast complex in
a wilderland of scree, snow and cliff. What sort of classes were held within,
lo on 50 years before? Why would a lift station rest below the penultimate
cliff of the ridge crest? It was in the wrong place, and the cables which
once reached it were now removed. We stood on a terrace of strangely sound
wood, remarking that the building was somehow maintained. A new steel door
(tightly locked, alas), and a new roof from the last 20 years protected
it. We didn't know what to call it, so we opted for a kind of default from
our twelve-year-old selves with "the Nazi compound."

We gained the ridge crest and looked down on the beclouded and wintry
Zugspitzeplatte, a great plateau that was once glacier. A dozen sledders
were screaming and enjoying themselves far below. We saw the other summits
along the ridge, though those to the south were continually disappearing
in cloud. Another cloud bedeviled the summit, and we made our rather tired
way up through deepening snow along ledges. Suddenly in the vast summit
complex, we moved through the trinket sellers to climb down the north side
to reach the true summit. A friendly crowd was here, everyone marvelling
as usual at the contrast between a pointy, windswept summit and the vast,
semi-crowded viewing platform 30 meters away. We took some pictures then
headed back for a beer and Germknoedel. Saving our knees, we took a lift
down to the car and returned home, driving away just as the storm truly
set into the region around 3:00 pm.

We had admired the W. Welzenbach West Wall route from the cable car, and
prepared vague designs to climb the route he did on the right of the great
wall...the ridge. Rated IV, it should be safer from stonefall. Of course
it's **very** rarely climbed!

Thanks Danno for a fun day!
