### Granite Mountain, 10/27/04}
Carlos Pessoa and I took advantage of the great weather this morning
to get in a "Dawn Patrol" hike. Somewhat delayed by his fascinating
guitar and keyboard setup at home, we eventually were hiking at 6:00
am. The trail was dry, the air was crisp, and there was hoarfrost
pushing up on the edges of the trail like crystaline entities. Once
above the trees there was a dusting of snow on the trail. Golden
sunrise found us in a frozen bog with the Lookout building visible
above. We took a time-consuming steeper line up deep snow drifts on
the final slope, discovering the much better "real trail" on the
descent. We felt like free men standing on the balcony of the Lookout,
sipping drinks and admiring a snowy group of peaks. Hiking down, we
encountered three parties going up. Most wise we all were on this blue
sky day!
