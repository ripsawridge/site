### Mount Si, January 14, 2005

Kris and the babies gave me the morning off for a hike. I took the old trail
up in cold, clear weather, running into icy trails above 2000 feet. I ignored
the frost-feathered Haystack today, but managed to endure 5 minutes of bone-chilling
wind at the park bench looking down on North Bend. Made it down without slipping
on the trail, quite a feat! 3 hours round trip.
