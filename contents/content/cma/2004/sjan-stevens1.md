### Steven's Pass Skiing, Jan 25, 2004

More skiing for me n' Kris. Kris really got out on the blue runs
today: Rock n' Blue, Broadway, then Hagen Hill and off to the
backside. Conditions were tougher there, as the Gemini run was
ungroomed. She fell and we couldn't get her skis back on, until I
realized that this contraption had to be locked down. We bailed from
the lower part of Gemini for a fun road ski on Outer Limits, which was
a good idea. Then we hurried back to the front on Skid Road and
Promenade. She was almost late for her lesson! I kind of wore her out
with that ambitious itinerary. Sorry dar! While Kris took a lesson, I
skied down Orion, much like the week before. I was getting excited to
ski down along the long lift, but a look at my watch convinced me
otherwise, so I did Aquarius Face, which was pretty "skiied out,"
and difficult for me. I fell and lost a ski in the deep snow!  After
10 minutes of searching in the deep snow, I found it. I then
re-connected with Orion and Gemini to the base, then screamed down
Crest Trail to meet Kris. We rested a good while and ate. Then off to
International, then Skyline. I took a steeper line down that, then did
the black diamond Exibition variation, which was great. We were now
very tired...
