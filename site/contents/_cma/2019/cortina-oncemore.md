## Saturday

Barbara and I drive down in the afternoon, taking the way through Kitzbühel and the
tunnel to Lienz in order to see more scenery and avoid the highway.
We climbed a few pitches of fun rock at the Falzerego Pass, then went to
our cabin in Pocol.

## Sunday

I learn to make coffee with Moka Pots.
Climb of the Kleiner Falzaregoturm by the Guide's Route (IV+).
Then a climb of the *Westwand* on the Großer Falzaregoturm (IV).

## Tuesday

We climb the Pyramide des Col dei Bos via the *Alpini*-kante (IV). We descend
the *klettersteig*, which is not without stress!

## Wednesday

We sleep in, then take a lift up to the Cinque Torri where we climb the
*Bergführer Weg* on the Torre Grande West Summit (IV+). Then we climb the
*Normalweg* on the south side of Torre Romana (IV), a wonderful chimney climb.
We hike down, having missed the last lift!

## Thursday

We sleep in, then drive home. One of Barbara's shoes was missing. I went on a hike
looking for it and found an interesting wilderness nearby. Then, as we prepared to
drive away, Barbara saw the shoe sitting in front of the car. This meant we had to
retrieve the *other* shoe from a trash can!

A leisurely drive home and a stop at Maxlroa for *Schnitzel*.

31 pitches of rock, 9 rappels, and endless, endless love.
