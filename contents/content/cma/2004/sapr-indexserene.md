### Index/Lake Serene, April 18, 2004
I hadn't been out in a while. I went to the Lower Town Wall and
quickly soloed the first two pitches of "Great Northern Slab." It
started to rain, so I rappelled down instead of climbing the last
pitch. Next I went to the Lake Serene trailhead, and made the hike up
to the Lake. There were still good local views, but the rain increased
steadily. I took the old trail, amazed at how icy-slick the roots and
logs become in the rain. Walking through a bit of snow at the top, I
reached the lake then accidentally poured Gatorade all over my pack. I
thought I put the cap back on. The Norwegian Buttresses looked pretty
amazing, what a great and horrible climb they would make! On the way
down I wished for a rain jacket, or maybe crampons for the icy
logs. It took me 35 minutes on the climb, then 2.5 hours for the hike
up and back. A great afternoon was had!
