### Monteneu

_November 2, 2017_

The boys and I were staying in Schruns for the second half of the
Herbsferien week. I took some gloves and my walkman, and hiked quickly
up the Monteneu above town. The elevation gain was about 1200 meters,
reaching a height of ~1850 meters, with only a dusting of snow near
the summit. Mostly, it was warm and wonderful as the Bartholomäberg
mountain faces south, providing a network of road and trail to the
summit. Pictures available <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/albums/72157665823748489">here</a>.


### Flintsbach Night Climbing

_September 30, 2017_

Barbara wanted to climb at night sometime. So we did! It was great fun.

### Wendelstein Night Hike

_September 4, 2017_

Barbara, her dog Mara and I started up the Wendelstein in the evening.
We walked from Bayrischzell to the house below the summit, going in
and buying a coffee for her and a beer for me, yeah! Mara got a
bowl of water. Technically they were closed, but Barbara used her
charm to win us a place while a couple guys who worked there talked
on the phone. I was cold so I'm wearing her sweater in the picture.

Mara was a good dog on the way down, sticking close to us in the dark.

### Kramerspitze (yes, again)
_March 4, 2017_

I didn't want to fight traffic, so I took the train to Garmisch.
I went up the usual way, and again had to break the trail around the
north side. Snowshoes were great here. For some reason, nobody uses
snowshoes in Germany (I'm being hyperbolic, but you know...). I pointed
the correct way to three people wading around up there.
On top I ran into a guy who slept in the forest the night before,
it sounded great.

On the way down I took a different way that was pretty fantastic.
I'm learning that this mountain is absolutely covered in trails.
Like in other areas of my life, I seem to like revisiting the small,
the under-appreciated, the tame...and then finding a whole world
in these "undramatic" places.

### Company ski-day
_February 24, 2017_

A fun time! I skinned up on my touring skis to the Hoehe Salve summit,
about 1100 meters up from the base at Söll. I ran into Yang and Ulan
on the way up, which was fun. Later, at lunch I couldn't find anyone
from the group. Oh well! I decided to spend the afternoon hiking down
and back up from Brixen im Thale. Since I had tennis shoes in my backpack,
I was able to hide my ski gear then walk about 500 meters down a road
and snow-free slopes. I did some meditation in the sun.

After all this, I hurried back, somewhat worried that the lifts would
close before I could make it to the Stocklalm on the north side of the
peak. Happily I just made it! The black runs coming down from the summit
were really excellent -- the snow good _firn_, very much spring conditions
(in the old days).

Hilarious dinner with the team. Lots of funny philosophical discussions.
Always tinged with the absurd, the way I like it best. :)

### Wallberg
_February 14, 2017_

Hannes, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg tonight. Well, they managed to
keep skis on. Hannes used ski-crampons to deal with the really icy
slope and I don't know how Camillo managed! For me it was at least
700 meters of hiking up with skis on my back, and very uncomfortable
side-hilling on the ice in ski boots. Ugh! But I kept up with those
guys on skis and heck, it was good exercise.

This time we went to the true summit for a great starry view down
to Tegernsee. It was strangely warm. We skied down in surprisingly
good conditions. Only the steep/icy bit near the bottom gave me trouble.
I essentially skidded down most of it. Beer and schnitzel at the
Bräuhaus after -- very nice!

### Kramerspitz
_February 4, 2017_

I snowshoed up Kramerspitz on a nice day. Slowly clouds scudded in
and by the end there was a light snow. The deep snow on the back side
was exhausting to make steps in. I nearly turned around before then!
But I continued on, running into just one person for the day, a woman
approaching the summit from a post-holing ascent directly up slope
from town. On the way down I saw her tracks diverge left and down --
very interesting! I'll have to try that way sometime.

### Wallberg

Jaro, Marcel, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg after work. It was very cold,
and we had lots of snow. Fun! Jaro wanted to skin right up the steepest
part of the slope, and we did this (though I lost patience and made a
boot track). Above this initial steep section, the skinning up was perfect.
On top there was a strong wind. There was a beautiful light in the distance,
where a cloud spilled over a ridge with a lighted hut on it.

We really enjoyed the ski down. We saw many parties coming up.
W00t!

### Brauneck
_January 7, 2017_

I was back two days later; high avalanche danger kept me out of the higher
mountains. It's simply because the uptrack is such an enjoyable trail, I didn't
mind skiing on a commercial ski mountain. I repeated what Jaro and I did
exactly, but on the way down I stopped at a strategic point where the uphill
track has two variations. The one Jaro and I did was to skin steeply up
along the east side of a hill and the left side of a little-used piste,
and then follow a steep and narrow trail in forest until making a long
traverse west near the crest of the hill to a saddle above the Florianhütte.
But the other route traverses below this hill on the south to reach the
hut itself, climbing very slowly, and then rejoining the other route at
the saddle. So I applied my skins again (elevation here is 1100 meters)
and went to the Florianhütte and from there to the summit.

This gave me a total elevation gain for the day of 1300 meters, which was
fine. I was in fact, well-pleased.

### Brauneck
_January 5, 2017_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck today from the Wegscheid Draxlhang lift. Kris
and I taught the boys to ski here, it brought back memories. Today, Jaro
and I followed the ski touring trail, which was excellent...it largely
avoided the piste in favor of quiet trails in forest. Also, they were
trails and not roads, which I really appreciated.
