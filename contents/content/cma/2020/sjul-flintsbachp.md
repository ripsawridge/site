### Flintsbach climbing
_July 9, 2020_

Uli and I climbed in the morning.

  * Led the 6- unnamed route just to the left of "Nur Fliegen ist sch√∂ner"
  * "Felsrowdy" - pitch one (5), and pitch two (6+/7-).
  * "Steinlaus" (6-)
  * "Miles Davies" (6-)
  * Normal route first pitch back on the slab side. I tried a couple harder
    things but got scared before the second bolt. Time for a stick clip!
