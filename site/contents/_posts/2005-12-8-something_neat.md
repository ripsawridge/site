For some reason, I've really liked certain paintings in this rough period
and have been seeking them out for rich colors. Maybe after a month of
eating "bachelor-like" I'm missing some mineral, whose need can be fed
by visual stimuli? Or maybe the first actual cold winter I've been in since
that season in Connecticut 17 years ago is responsible.
  
  
The things I like are by a couple of folks who lived around here: [Franz Marc](http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/marc/overview.php) and
Kandinsky. This painting ["The Unfortunate Land of Tirol"](http://siteimages.guggenheim.org/gpc_work_large_560.jpg) by
Franz Marc is my current favorite. He has another picture that I like called
["The Dog Before the World."](http://www.angel-art-house.com/upload/ProductImg/marc-63%20The%20Dog%20before%20the%20World,%201912.jpeg)He was killed in WWI. Kandinsky is pretty
famous. I just like the combination of rich colors with little cubes and
gadgets, and the sense of depth. I think my friend James Brown prepared
me for this stuff with his paintings that used even richer colors, and
more elaborate bio-mechanical automatons populating a desert landscape.
