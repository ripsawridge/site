### Alpspitz (attempt)
_May, 2013_

Hiked up from the car, but above the lift station hip deep snow and lack of
gaitors were demoralizing. It took 30 minutes to break trail across what should
be a 10 minute walk. I reached the ladders of the via ferrata, and started up,
hoping that steepness would help with the snow depth. But it's a pretty ledgy
route, and the ledges held deep snow. I went up about 50 meters and called it
quits. Hiked back down.
