### Jog to Gruenwald
_February 17, 2008_

Sunday late afternoon I jogged to Gruenwald from home while the kids were
napping. The run along the Isar was really enjoyable. I add it here because it
was kind of like a "mountain trip," at least in my mind. Beautiful sunset from
the cliffs above the river. It was 10 miles including doubling back to meet
Kris and the boys at McDonalds in the town.
