### West Fork Foss River, 12/23/04}
There are only trace amounts of snow to Trout Lake, and increasing
snow to Copper Lake, although a boot track exists to there. Snowshoes
would be desirable beyond. The weather was good, with great views at
Copper Lake. I would have loved to continue on to Big Heart Lake! 4
hours car to car.


### Granite Mountain, 10/27/04}
Carlos Pessoa and I took advantage of the great weather this morning
to get in a "Dawn Patrol" hike. Somewhat delayed by his fascinating
guitar and keyboard setup at home, we eventually were hiking at 6:00
am. The trail was dry, the air was crisp, and there was hoarfrost
pushing up on the edges of the trail like crystaline entities. Once
above the trees there was a dusting of snow on the trail. Golden
sunrise found us in a frozen bog with the Lookout building visible
above. We took a time-consuming steeper line up deep snow drifts on
the final slope, discovering the much better "real trail" on the
descent. We felt like free men standing on the balcony of the Lookout,
sipping drinks and admiring a snowy group of peaks. Hiking down, we
encountered three parties going up. Most wise we all were on this blue
sky day!

### Mount Dickerman, 10/24/04}
On the spur of the moment, I left the house for a hike up
Mount Dickerman. It had been a few years since I was there, and I thought I'd
see what the first big snowstorm had done to the high country. I started
hiking at 1:30 pm, through damp but pleasant forest. The sword ferns looked
exceptionally dark green and healthy. Once above the dense forest slope I
saw patches of blue sky, and unobstructed views across the valley to
Big Four Mountain, Vesper Peak, Sperry and Del Campo, the latter partially
shrouded in cloud. The light was quite dramatic, because a dense gray band
of cloud over those mountains shaded and blackened them, but enough
sun could peak through to bath me in sunshine. The snow became deeper, 
and I appreciated the packed-in trail as depths reached two feet below the summit.
A quick look around at peaks to the south (Sloan looked especially nice,
though beshrouded), then it started to snow on me. Clouds engulfed the upper
slopes and I hiked away, back to the deep valley at 5:15 pm.

### Granite Mountain, 10/14/04}
I went for a quick hike up Granite Mountain in the morning, but I took my
natural history book to try and identify some plants. Where the forest opened
up to brush, I got out the book and started trying to identify things.
Before long, I knew I wouldn't be going any further: there was too much to
name! I saw Red Alder and Braken and Swordfern and Maidenhair fern and
Mountain Lover and Snowberry and Cascara and Big Leaf Maple and Vine Maple
and Western Red Cedar trees and Douglas Fir trees and Salmonberry.
Now if I can only remember all those names! I ran down the trail with
a better appreciation of the woods I usually tromp through unthinkingly.

### Index Climbing, 10/02/04}
Robert Meshew and I went for a quick morning climb. We warmed up on the finger
crack pitch of Aries, then I got scared trying to lead the chimney (which seemed
so easy last time!). Both of us backed off of that, so Robert led around a
different way, and I finished the climb with the cool undercling traverse
to the chain anchors. I eventually realized the mistake in the chimney: we needed
to place some gear high in the back, then come back down and start chimney-climbing
well out in the wide slot. It feels really insecure trying to begin climbing
it when you are lodged deep in the back. Oh well, next time! After this, Robert led
the first pitch of 
Princely Ambition, doing a great job on his first time.
I led pitch 2, dirty but still fun. Then Robert led 
Godzilla and I followed.
A great morning at Index!

### Index Climbing, 9/21/04}
Carlos's brother had never gone rock climbing before, so the three of us
headed out early in the morning for a quick jaunt up Great Northern Slab.
He did really well, and is probably hooked for life! I know I was...

### Index Climbing, 8/29/04}
Mardi had never climbed at Index, so Bob and I took her out there for
a fun climb of the Great Northern Slab route.  She did super well! Actually, it
seemed like Bob was more inclined to feel wierd about the exposure
while rappeling and stuff like that than she was :-). We did the usual
three pitches, climbing the bolted slab variation on the last
one. Then just for fun we climbed the 2nd pitch of Aries: the 5.8
stellar finger crack that leads to the chimney. On the way home Bob
said "so are you going to put this on your little web site?" He can
be such a mom sometimes!

### Index Climbing, 7/22/04}
Rudy and I were back (3 weeks later?) for a quick morning climbing fix.
He led Japanese Gardens to the mid-pitch double bolt anchor as a warm up.
I top roped it, found it fun and fairly easy - a great warm up. Leaving gear
in place, he re-led, then reached the first crux after a tricky lieback/offwidth
section. Getting good gear above a bulge, he set off on shallow cuticle jams (5.11b),
and lobbed off just as his right hand reached a great fingerlock. It was
an exciting 20 foot fall, which woke him up nicely. The tiny TCU he placed
in a finger pocket held. After sending the move, he reached the second crux (5.11c)
and had a similar problem, again overcome after one fall.

Now I had to somehow climb it, yikes! I repeated the first section,
finding it harder now that the sun was beating on the crag. I had some
trouble moving from lieback to offwidth, but got it on the second
try. The first crux was incredibly hard I thought.  I flailed around
greatly, eventually "grokking" the 2-3 moves required to reach a
great finger pocket. A bit tired, I climbed a hand crack up to a big
stem, then positioned for the final crux - a real monster! I made the
first moves but never did figure out the next two or three needed to
get into a solid crack above. Once on the ground Rudy could explain
the kind of dynamic nature of it - hands on a shallow ledge, walk your
feet up quickly and lunge for the crack. Sounds so easy now! (yeah
right). A few more moves reached the anchor. What a great climb,
something to work on for me definitely!

The wall was baking even at 9 am, so we repaired to the Inner
Wall. Rudy gave me beta for Toxic Shock (5.9), and I climbed up, a
little frazzled from the previous hard climb.  Nonetheless, I found my
kidneys turning yellow from the shock of steep liebacking, then an
awesome, bomber vertical hand crack. Rudy climbed it, then I scrambled
the variation 5.8 start to the route. Halfway up Rudy tossed me a rope
to tie on to so I wouldn't hit the ground if I fell. Good idea, oh
wait, that was my idea! It's a great variation, definitely do both.

Off to work, sad to leave the granite planet!

### Index Climbing}
Rudy R. and I went to Index for a few quick hours before work. Rudy
led Sagittarius (5.9), a climb I'd wanted to do for a while but was
intimidated by. It was really fun: a few lieback moves to a hand
crack with good gear, then easy face climbing under the long roof to bolts.
Then an awkward off-width crack/chimney that leads to more hand cracks
and a lieback to the bolted belay. Awesome!

After this, Rudy gave me some beta for Roger's Corner, and I led
the short 5.7 first pitch and 5.9 second pitch as one. The second pitch
went through a section of grainy rock, then reached a stellar series of
cracks below a tree anchor. From here, Rudy led Breakfast of Champions (5.10a).
I followed, enjoying the insecure opening moves and bomber hand-jams above.
We thought it was getting late, so made rappels to the ground and drove
away. But we actually had time for one or two more climbs! Next time
we'll bring a watch to the cliff. A great first climb with Rudy!

### Mount Si, June 17, 2004}
Went for a quick hike up Mount Si after work. I made it to the top of the
Haystack 1 hour 35 minutes after leaving the car, and back down in 45
minutes (after a nice long rest on top!). There is a lot of work being
done in the first 2 miles of the new trail, many new steps.

### Index Climbing, June 3, 2004}
Carlos had never been climbing outside, so I took him to Index to climb
Great Northern Slab. He did very well on the climbing. On the last pitch, I
chose to follow a line of 3 bolts on the left of the slab rather than my usual
"pilgrim's progress" up a shallow crack on the right to the trees. The bolts
were fun, probably about 5.7 or so in difficulty. For Carlos, untutored in
slab climbing, this was the hardest part. He worked mightily to master the
moves, eventually arriving at the little forest that marks the top of the climb.
We met cc.com friends "Greg W" and "Snugtop" here, teaming up for a double
rope rappel down Velvasheen to the iron bolts. Alas! the ropes were stuck
fast somehow. We executed some shinanigans to eventually free them and
continue our descent. Another great evening at Index!

### Snoqualmie Mountain, May 22, 2004}
Needing some exercise but unable to get inspired by the health club, I
resigned myself to a rainy ascent of Snoqualmie Mountain. I walked
into the fog and clouds via the old trail near the Snow Lake
trailhead, taking a left turn 1000 feet up for Snoqualmie rather than
Guye. I was surprised to see a guy on his way down near here. The
clouds were thick but it wasn't raining, which was nice. About 400
feet below the summit, I met a party of two. We sat on rocks at the
summit and talked about climbs and hikes until it started snowing
hard. They went to climb Guye Peak, and I trundled my way down snow,
slick roots, rocks and trail.

### Exit 38, April 29, 2004}
Josh and I unwittingly hiked past the Amazonia and Club Paradiso walls, failing
upwards all the way to the Peannicle. We saw a few sad rocks along the way, all
dripping and unattractive, so I guess it was just as well. We climbed
"Peanut Brittle," finding it a bit harder than the 5.6/5.7 rating it gets in
the guidebook. Then "Killer Bob," which had enjoyable juggy holds to escape an
overhang (5.9). Finally, we climbed "Gallivant (5.10a)," which was the longest
route, with interesting moves on a steep slab to a vertical headwall. I belayed
Josh from the top of this one, which provided a great view of the fertile valley
below. A rappel, then nice jog back to the trailhead. "Be gentle, but be
vigilant" was the catchphrase of the morning, invented from a meaty stew of
conversation about public servants, irate laypeople, a lack of toilet paper, and
egregious affronts to propriety.

### Wallace Falls, April 26, 2004}
I went for an evening hike/jog to the Upper Falls. It took me about
50 minutes to reach it. I enjoyed the pleasant forest trail with 
scenic views looking down to the river. The falls had a huge volume
of water. At the middle falls on the way down I looked out at the golden valley.

### Index/Lake Serene, April 18, 2004}
I hadn't been out in a while. I went to the Lower Town Wall and
quickly soloed the first two pitches of "Great Northern Slab." It
started to rain, so I rappelled down instead of climbing the last
pitch. Next I went to the Lake Serene trailhead, and made the hike up
to the Lake. There were still good local views, but the rain increased
steadily. I took the old trail, amazed at how icy-slick the roots and
logs become in the rain. Walking through a bit of snow at the top, I
reached the lake then accidentally poured Gatorade all over my pack. I
thought I put the cap back on. The Norwegian Buttresses looked pretty
amazing, what a great and horrible climb they would make! On the way
down I wished for a rain jacket, or maybe crampons for the icy
logs. It took me 35 minutes on the climb, then 2.5 hours for the hike
up and back. A great afternoon was had!

### Lake 22, April, 2004}
Carlos told me that this was a great easy hike with spectacular views from
the lake, so when Kris and I had the afternoon free, I jumped at the chance for us
to go there. We started hiking around 2 pm, and after a long walk through
scenic forest, found ourselves switchbacking up an open hillside. Kris named
a mountain across the valley "Mount Cous-cous." I approved heartily. Once back
in the forest, we continued on packed snow to the lake outlet. Indeed, the
cliffs were spectacular, with a few waterfalls cascading down to the lake.
Kris saw her first avalanche here, when blocks of snow fell away from a high
portion of the wall. The rumbling and roar continued for about 30 seconds.
A family teetered across a log to a trail on the other side of the outlet.
The sun was warm, and Kris enjoyed her packet of "Corn Gone Wrong." We headed
down, talking about all sorts of things. We stopped to rest on a bridge over
the raging river. It was a fun trip!

### Index Climbing, April 2, 2004}
Peter Chapman and I got up early for a morning climb at Index.
We decided to climb 2 pitches of Princely Ambitions (5.10a).
I really enjoy this climb. For me it is a little scary, especially
early in the season. The individual moves are not strenuous, but
require balance and a willingness to commit. The step-to-the-right
move below the hand traverse, and then the hand traverse itself are
the mental cruxes. This time, I placed a very good medium nut at the
start of the hand traverse - Peter almost had to leave it while cleaning.
I'd never placed anything there before successfully. Here goes!
It's amazing how the vertical wall begins cutting away beneath you
as you traverse. A patch of running water made for some damp rock
and some anxiety midway. It was great to pull up and place an
orange Metolius cam on the other side. Peter enjoyed his first time
on the great pitch. He continued for the lead of pitch 2, rated 5.8.
It climbs a crack and shallow chimney for 30 meters, the rock kind
of grainy near the top. He found it instructive and very satisfying.
The sun felt like like summer on the peaks around, crisp in the
still, cool air.

### Vantage Climbing, March 20, 2004}
Peter, Kim and I went out for some climbing. We narrowly escaped a car
accident on the way when a truck cut off a car in front of us. That car
wildly swung across the interstate, barely escaped rolling, and came
to a stop after 360 degrees in the median. We rode right through their
path, also coming to a gentle stop in the median. I helped push the
guy's car out of the median where it had dug itself in. He was lucky,
we were lucky - the truck that cut him off should feel lucky too.
So anyway, Peter led "Chossmaster" (5.7) as one long pitch, a good
warm up, but Kim was disconcerted by the different character of the
rock from her plastic medium of the last few months! Then I got fired
up to go crack climbing, so I led "Tangled up in Blue (5.9)," having
to rest on the rope twice, not used to the complexity of placing 
gear and actually climbing! That tired me out, so I rested while
Peter and Kim climbed "Vantage Point (5.8)," a great arete climb they
both enjoyed. Then I led "Crossing the Threshold (5.8)," a considerably
easier crack climb, but really fun. Kim followed it, maybe it was her
first 5.8 crack climb? The exit was really loose and ugly, we had to
be very careful getting up to the plateau. Theron and Justin stopped
by to say hello, and we finished by Peter leading "Party in your Pants
(5.8)," aka "Twin Cracks." I followed it. I'm always giving him a hard 
time for his hexes, but he made some great placements with them I must say.
Alas, we had to go home early for a dinner appointment. Really fun
time though, thanks guys!

### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, March 12, 2004}

Friday night Kris and I skied for a few hours at Summit West. Pretty fun, but
kind of icy too.


### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, March 7, 2004}

I came back with Kris Sunday afternoon. Despite constant rain (yuck), we had
a good time. She improved her skiing technique dramatically, and learned to
go faster yet relax more. Finally we quit at 5 pm, totally soaked but pleased.
We stayed at Summit West.

### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, March 6, 2004}

I had from 8 until noon, so I decided to visit the Snoqualmie Pass ski area.
I started at Summit West, and gradually worked my way over to Summit East,
skiing some runs multiple times for fun. The most crowded lift was at
Summit East, so pretty soon I started back. Fun time, and I thought Kris
would like these slopes better than Crystal Mtn since there are more
uniform beginner slopes. Pretty nice weather, including some sun. The
views of Guye Peak, Commonwealth Basin and the Gold Creek valley were very
pretty.


### Oahu Hike - Lanipo Ridge, Feb 27, 2004}
I had the morning free to hike, so I hiked/ran up the Lanipo Ridge
trail in a strong wind. There was supposed to be a big storm
coming. The trail was beautiful, with a steep drop-off on either
side of the narrow ridge for it's 3.5 mile length. There were many
ups and downs. Eventually I entered a cloud, so my views of
windward-side Oahu were obscured. I hiked down, then the downpour
arrived: horizontal sheets of rain got me soaked. Good trail!

### Cougar Mountain Run, Feb 22, 2004}
In the evening I went for a run from the Wilderness Cliffs trail up
to Anti-aircraft Peak and back. It was a nice sunset as I returned
to the car.

### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Feb 20-21, 2004}

Kris and I stayed two nights at Crystal Mountain for skiing. I bought a
new book about it and learned some great new techniques. Kris had her
new skis, and they were taking some adjustment to learn about. She also
took a lesson, but it was disappointing. Also, snowboarders bumped into
her and knocked her over twice on one run, so we were both kind of unhappy.
The next day I got up early and skied, doing better at making many short
turns. Then Kris came out and again had a challenging time. We decided
to go home a day early, as she was really sore. Oh well, better luck
next time!

### The Tooth, Feb 14, 2004}
I will move this to a larger page when I get pictures. Theron, Peter and
I had an adventurous day near the Tooth. First breaking trail up there,
then climbing a steep gully to the notch (Theron's fingers froze painfully
as he led the way near the end), then the first pitch of the Tooth.
I climbed with crampons and ice tools in a cold wind and snow. About
40 feet up I came to an impass I could only protect with a #3 Camelot,
but I didn't have the gear. The moves (torqueing my tools deep in a crack)
felt sketchy enough that I couldn't do it without some protection.
Without the requisite rucksack full of courage, I was spent. Theron and
Peter were cold standing in the wind, so we rappelled down the gully
and went for some ice climbing on the other side of the bowl.
Peter led a great pitch (WI3+ by his lights) up vertical bulges of yellow
ice to an awkward snow/brush topout. We all top-roped the pitch once or
twice, it was really fun. On the way down, Peter set off a small but scary
slab avalanche. We saw the slope crack all around him and the top layer
slid down. Luckily, he wasn't caught in it!

Here are the pictures for now:

### Mount Si, Feb 13, 2004}
Theron and I hiked up the old trail to Mount Si before work. It was
his first time on that trail. I was worried about missing an important
turn in the dark, but it was light enough for me to see. We had fun
hiking up, then on a whim decided to climb the haystack. Neither of us
had ice axes, but I had "instep" crampons (for icy streets and
sidewalks!) and Theron had his full alpine crampons. It was a good mix
of dry rock and crusty snow. It took two hours to the summit, where we
admired great views of Seattle and Mt. Rainier. Getting down was
tough, the footing on icy ground was kind of insecure without front
points. Theron kicked a few steps for me on the lower section. Anyway,
the "instep" crampons were really great for the icy upper mile of
the trail.  We headed down, exciting about some climbing for the next
day.

### Cougar Mountain, Feb 5, 2004}
Ran 7 miles this morning after meeting Robert here. He is in much
better shape, left me in the dust. But we met later near Wilderness
Peak. I continued to near Doughty Falls, then went through this "Shy
Bear Marsh" to get back, in a big figure 8 loop.


### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Feb 1, 2004}

Robert, Josh and I went skiing (snowboarding for Robert). It was
great. I did some more black diamond runs, and Josh taught me about
skiing down the fall line more aggressively. I think I got the message
near the end of the day, and am excited to work on it more. I added it
up, we descended over 12,000 feet and skied 10 miles!  That is really
neat to be able to cover so much ground. We saw Bob and Mardi in a
freak meeting. We also saw Mark Haley, which was awesome. Aidan was
off shredding the backcountry or somethin'.


### Steven's Pass Skiing, Jan 25, 2004}

More skiing for me n' Kris. Kris really got out on the blue runs
today: Rock n' Blue, Broadway, then Hagen Hill and off to the
backside. Conditions were tougher there, as the Gemini run was
ungroomed. She fell and we couldn't get her skis back on, until I
realized that this contraption had to be locked down. We bailed from
the lower part of Gemini for a fun road ski on Outer Limits, which was
a good idea. Then we hurried back to the front on Skid Road and
Promenade. She was almost late for her lesson! I kind of wore her out
with that ambitious itinerary. Sorry dar! While Kris took a lesson, I
skied down Orion, much like the week before. I was getting excited to
ski down along the long lift, but a look at my watch convinced me
otherwise, so I did Aquarius Face, which was pretty "skiied out,"
and difficult for me. I fell and lost a ski in the deep snow!  After
10 minutes of searching in the deep snow, I found it. I then
re-connected with Orion and Gemini to the base, then screamed down
Crest Trail to meet Kris. We rested a good while and ate. Then off to
International, then Skyline. I took a steeper line down that, then did
the black diamond Exibition variation, which was great. We were now
very tired...


### Cougar Mountain, Jan 22, 2004}
I'd long wondering about trail running, and a gut-busting Indian Food
meal the night before with Kris and Theron convinced me it was time to
step up to the plate. I forgot my headlamp, so I had to wait until
7:15 to start, but I parked at the Squak Mtn. Connector Trail (I
mistakenly thought it was the Wilderness Creek trailhead, which would
cause hilarity later when I finished my "loop." Of course, I didn't
have a map either!). I used the "50 Trail Runs in Washington" book
to chose a course. I altered that books course to shorten the 14 mile
run to about 11 miles by truncating the loop at Clay Pit Road.


This was more fun than I expected it to be. Especially with music! The
sunrise was awesome, with a golden Mt. Rainier and pink sky visible
from Wilderness Peak. I really enjoyed running along the trail. My
truncated loop took me 2.5 hours. It was hard to keep track of all the
junctions, but the signs were good. I'm going to be pretty sore I
think! Looking forward to some more of this...

### Steven's Pass Skiing, Jan 18, 2004}

Kris and I went skiing Sunday. It was snowing moderately, probably
good because conditions were icy before. We did the green run a few
times, then a blue run (Broadway), then she had a lesson while I went
to the "backside." I went down Gemini, then Orion, which was my
first black diamond run by myself. No falls! Although it tired me
out. I screamed back to the front because her lesson was over. We ate
lunch, then I skied down "Showcase" - I really like that run, I
think it is my favorite blue run, as the angle is constant and steep
enough for a great view of the area below. We did Rock n Blue and then
Skyline together, which was really fun - she had already improved! But
now she was beat, so she skied to the car and I got in two more quick
runs. First "Parachute 1," this was too steep and narrow for me to
do well. I nearly fell on a broken beer bottle in the middle of the
run! Then I did the black diamond variation to "International,"
which was great.


### Index Climbing, Jan 16, 2004}
Peter and I each led "Steel Monkey," a great C1 aid climb easiest with thin nuts.
The sun came out for a while, and there was some rock fall at the Quarry. 

### Mt. Catherine Loop, Jan 11, 2004}
Josh, Dan, Peter and myself had most of the day for some nordic
skiing. The Mt. Catherine Loop seemed like a good idea, with some
trail-less navigation to Nordic Pass.
We managed to fit all four of us with skis in my car,
and drove to the pass. Peter and Dan had beefy AT gear, while
Josh and I had long tele skis and leather boots. We skinned up
into a foggy area, and ended up going a mile the wrong way on
a groomed road. We figured that out, then set off on a snowshoe
trail to reach Frog Lake. Dan got a blister and we scrounged some
duct tape for him from rips in my battered shell jacket. Continuing
southwest on a compass bearing, we made for Nordic Pass, fighting
the occasional problem with skins, bindings, etc. Time was
speeding by, and we almost turned around below the pass, as the
low visibility and casual nature of our travel made us wonder if
we were all turned around somehow. But we were mostly on track, 
hitting the pass just a bit to the north where a great view of
Silver Peak appeared briefly in the fog. Josh and I hiked down
about 100 feet to the pass - steep terrain in dense trees that
Peter and Dan managed to ski. Getting down from the pass was an
adventure. I suffered numerous face-plants, eventually learning to
side-step and traverse the difficulties. Josh gave up and hiked!
We had some time in the sun, then went south over Windy Pass and
took a long coasting ride on a road. My skis with their scales
seemed to be the slowest. We spent a long time on nearly-level
terrain to get back to the car. Dan was worried about being late,
so we hurried quickly back to the Sound. 

It was a fun day with lots of laughs!


### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Jan 10, 2004}

Bob, Mardi, Kris and I went here for a great day of skiing.
Kris took a lesson and improved her ability. Bob and Mardi
led me down a black diamond run called "Sunshine," that was
fun-slash-scary! Kris and I went down the long "Queens" run
together and I took a detour on the "CMAC" run near the bottom.
Bob and Mardi led me up another chairlift that only had
double-black-diamond runs to get down! We did a long traverse
into a bowl, and headed straight down that. This one was too
steep for me and I crashed a few times. Finally I had to
do kick turns to make it down! A few more blue runs finished
out the day. I was really sore Monday!


### Franklin Falls ice climbing, Jan 5, 2004}
Dan Smith and I got a late start from town and began hiking up the
snow-covered road to Franklin Falls near Snoqaulmie Pass. It was a 
pleasant 2.5 mile hike, first on road then trail, mostly level.
We reached the falls which had a lot of water coming down, but
there were some great curtains of ice mostly to the left. We
saw a variety of ideas, imagining setting up top ropes after a lead.

It looked easy enough for me to lead, so Dan belayed me up some ice 
steps. Solid ice screws provided protection low on the route.

![Franklin Falls](images/articles/trips/2004/franklinfallsice.jpg)

There was running water behind the curtain of ice I climbed, and
sometimes I would break through the ice and see water spraying
inches from my face! About 50 feet up, the ice ran out, and there
were some scary moves on dripping rock under snow. I was able to
place a sawed-off knifeblade piton here. Traversing left, I reached
an ice pillar and placed a screw. I decided against climbing it, as
the top out looked like evil vertical brush under a thin layer of
snow. Also, the ice was brittle. Later I realized I had dulled my
tools by hitting rock under thin ice, so it wasn't necessarily
that brittle, but dull tools cause it to fracture. So I traversed
left, then went up an interesting ramp of ice mushrooms. 
Near
the top of the ramp, I hurried to avoid spray from a secondary
waterfall. I reached an alcove, and after some experimentation,
made a belay by slinging a large ice pillar. We had imagined
climbing this pillar to trees 20 feet above, but the pillar terminated
in a ceiling and would provide some overhanging climbing we didn't
feel like doing! Funny how much easier it looked from below...

![Climbing on Franklin Falls](images/articles/trips/2004/franklinfallsice2.jpg)

Dan came up. He enjoyed the climb quite a bit. It was almost a full
rope length, with decent protection and varied terrain. In honor of
an event Dan and I shared the day before, I'd call the route 
"Bald Tires" - WI3. Bring stubbies and pitons. 

![We rapped off the pillar](images/articles/trips/2004/merapfranklin.jpg)

with a piton backup, a 60 meter rope was required to touch down.

We bouldered around for a while, then headed home. Many hikers
were coming in, and we had been an object of attention for various
parties of two and three. "Are the ice climbers still there?"
