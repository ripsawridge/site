### Martinswand easy cragging
<i>January 16, 2011</i>


Christian and I took advantage of the sun today by exercising rusty rock
climbing skills. Well at least in my case, for his case he is almost totally
new to it. Today would be his first lead on rock and his first short multipitch
climb. Good job, man!

We spent the whole time at the Ã–AV-Klettergarten. We climbed:

<ul>
<li>Skyscraper (IV+). (3 times/1 lead) - cold!</li>
<li>Knochenbeisser (V+). (3 times/2 leads) - scary polish, finally wired it.</li>
<li>Das vergessene Tal (V). - such a polished start.</li>
<li>Herta Dach links (VI-/VI). - really sweet.</li>
<li>Gasthof Post (VI-). (2 times/1 lead) - really nice crack climbing!</li>
<li>Jong (V-). (Christian led this one)</li>
<li>Vipper (V+/VI-). - sustained, slabby face, excellent!</li>
<li>Die lange Kindertour (IV+).</li>
<li>Neuberg (V/V+). (Christian skipped this one)</li>
</ul>

Not too shabby, at least, better than sitting at home. That was 14 "pitches" for me, 13 for Christian.

Thanks Christian for a great time! 

Now I'm considerably more stoked for rock climbing...
