### Index Climbing, April 2, 2004
Peter Chapman and I got up early for a morning climb at Index.
We decided to climb 2 pitches of Princely Ambitions (5.10a).
I really enjoy this climb. For me it is a little scary, especially
early in the season. The individual moves are not strenuous, but
require balance and a willingness to commit. The step-to-the-right
move below the hand traverse, and then the hand traverse itself are
the mental cruxes. This time, I placed a very good medium nut at the
start of the hand traverse - Peter almost had to leave it while cleaning.
I'd never placed anything there before successfully. Here goes!
It's amazing how the vertical wall begins cutting away beneath you
as you traverse. A patch of running water made for some damp rock
and some anxiety midway. It was great to pull up and place an
orange Metolius cam on the other side. Peter enjoyed his first time
on the great pitch. He continued for the lead of pitch 2, rated 5.8.
It climbs a crack and shallow chimney for 30 meters, the rock kind
of grainy near the top. He found it instructive and very satisfying.
The sun felt like like summer on the peaks around, crisp in the
still, cool air.
