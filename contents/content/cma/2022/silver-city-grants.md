*To go back to days 8 and before, [click here](lordsburg-silver-city.html).*

*This section had 2 food resupplies, but I never slept in a bed. I was so
intimidated by the 120 mile walk without resupply to Pie Town. But after
doing that, the 75 miles to Grants wasn't too bad.*

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage3.jpg %}
First, a short 44.5 miles and 6940 feet elevation gain to the heart of the Gila Wilderness.
Then two long stages first to Pie Town, then Grants.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage4.jpg %}
From Doc Campbells, 120 miles and 15641 feet elevation gain through the Gila and north to Pie Town.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage5.jpg %}
74.7 miles and 3927 feet elevation gain down to the big city of Grants over
3 days, mostly road walking.

## April 29, day 9 - 21 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day9.jpg %}
Today we left town and slept at a pass in the Gila National Forest.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03820.jpg %}
This spectre gave Lemonhope and I a shock on the county road leaving Silver
City.

*Blog entry [In the River](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/in-river.html)
covers some of this*.

Lemonhope and I were up in the dark, and soon walking through town
to the north. I had a light pack, only 3 days of food for the 45 miles
to Doc Campbell's. Lemonhope told me about his time in the marines.
He had a funny story about everybody wanting to be an "alpha," but
the truth is, it would be impossible to run an army if everyone was
that way, because they'd chafe at taking orders...they'd quit and
rage all the time. "Nope, you're all betas" he'd say to his
squadron. He'd say all this with an air of incredulity that invited
me to look at the craziness of the world and laugh with him.

We discovered that we're both rabid fans of the cartoon show
"Adventure Time." In fact, that's where his trail name comes from.
I thought it was a great trail name. Lemonhope is one of the "lemon
people," who tend to live in oppressive communist dictatorships
ruled by the most sour among them. But he seems to ignore all that
and go off on a grand adventure. He lives for days and perhaps eons
in a solipsistic haze, enjoying himself whatever he does but failing
to see the damage he leaves in his wake. He has a story arc in
the show where he gradually learns to express gratitude, to develop
skills, and to function in a mutually beneficial hierarchy of
friendship and duty with a german guy who harvests the oil from
sky whales from a glorious balloon ship.

Finally, Lemonhope returns to the Lemon Kingdom and deposes the
evil dictator by playing his harp. My idea is that the harp is
the light of consciousness applied into the self. The dictator can't
stand the music and explodes. But Lemonhope isn't made to be a leader,
despite all the positive things he learned. When we last see him,
he's wandered the planet until everyone is gone. He returns as a very
old lemon to his childhood bedroom, now crumbling and deserted.
And takes a nap.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220429_131821.jpg %}
Lemonhope checks the mail at the "regis-tree." Put here by a religious hermit
who sometimes comes down to invite people up to his trailer and share homemade
beer with them. I wish we had had the pleasure of meeting him!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03825.jpg %}
It's been a long time since I saw Curtis, but here he is near the Devils
Garden.

The road took us into a forest, and then as the day warmed up, to
higher country with rocky towers below us called the Devils Garden.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03827.jpg %}
In the Devils Garden there are hundreds of small towers you could get lost
in.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03831.jpg %}
There are also spiny plants!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03832.jpg %}
Looking back down to the Garden from Tadpole Ridge, getting close to camp.

Eventually we climbed above this to higher forest that reminded me
of the lovely pine country on Burro Peak. We stopped at a spring
for water.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220429_155255.jpg %}
I'm resting at the pleasant spring on the south side of Tadpole Ridge.

View from the spring. People had placed rocks artfully to be able to scoop
more water.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03834.jpg %}
Lemonhope shows off his good pitch. This is how you travel light!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03835.jpg %}
Evening at the tight little pass above Sheep Corral Canyon.

It seemed good to camp at a mountain pass. The next day we'd drop
down into the Gila River and start a whole new phase of the trip.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03836.jpg %}
We ate dinner as the sun went down and it started getting cold.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03839.jpg %}
Goodnight, Gila National Forest!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03840.jpg %}
Goodnight, Lemonhope.

## April 30, day 10 - 21 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day10.jpg %}
Down from the forest into the canyon. Walking through water for mile after
mile...

It was a chilly morning but I was able to warm up by walking.
Down from the pass, we walked through a forested canyon, then up
onto a ridge. The trail started switchbacking down into the Gila,
with interesting views to the opposite walls of the canyon.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03842.jpg %}
On the Sapillo Trail leading down into the Gila River Canyon, straight ahead.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03845.jpg %}

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03847.jpg %}
On the canyon floor. The sycamore trees were beautiful.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03849.jpg %}
Lying under a sycamore tree.

I was a bit afraid of all the river crossings, thinking that I'd
get blisters because of them or have other foot problems.
However, that never happened. In fact, as the day wore on and the
miles added up, I looked forward to sloshing into the water yet
again because the cool water reduced swelling in my feet and
kept me feeling refreshed. True, if you are away from the water a
while, your feet and socks never really dry, and then the sand
and dirt gets annoying. But at the next stream you'll emerge
freshly washed again, so it's not so bad.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03852.jpg %}
Lemonhope makes one of more than 50 river crossings this day.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03861.jpg %}
In the water yet again...

As for the trail, it breaks up sometimes and I found myself
walking on the opposite side of the river than the main trail.
"Oh well," I'd say, then just forge ahead on riverbanks and through
scrub trees to a crossing, slosh my way across and end up on the
main trail again.

In the heat of the late afternoon I surprised a rattlesnake.
Wow, nothing woke me up like that rattling sound! Without getting
a clear picture of it, I sprang back away into the bushes in
the opposite direction then made a wide arc around the nest of
rocks and sticks where the snake was (happily I didn't find
another snake).

Later, I saw some kind of garden snake, and later still I heard
a rattle nearby and scrambled away without investigating.

I got the idea that dang, snakes quite like water. In the rest of
the trail I'd see snakes a few times, including in Colorado (though
not poisonous snakes, so far as I know), but every time I saw
one water was nearby.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03863.jpg %}
Oh thank goodness, a bit of dry walking!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03867.jpg %}
The canyon widened out in the late afternoon.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03868.jpg %}
Lemonhope fresh from a crossing. He injured his foot pretty nicely along in
here by running into a branch.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03871.jpg %}
I couldn't stop looking at the trees.

We arrived at a hot spring after 20 miles. It was only 3 miles to
Doc Campbells, but it didn't seem worth it to keep walking because
we'd just sleep on the ground there anyway. And boy, was I tired!

One thing that felt really nice was to go over and soak my feet in
the hot water. I returned to our sandy camp. We chatted a while and went
to sleep. Nobody came by.

## May 1, day 11 - 3 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day11.jpg %}
Basically a rest day...

Just a short walk to Doc Campbell's, then we got a lift from a nice fella
with a van to the Cliff Dwellings National Monument.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03874.jpg %}
We're getting a lesson on the people of this region.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03877.jpg %}

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03885.jpg %}
People apparently lived here only about 80 years.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03908.jpg %}
I thought this might be handy as a reference photo later.

Back at the post, I bought supplies for the 120 mile walk to Pie Town and
ate frozen burritos and ice cream as the afternoon turned to evening.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220501_190623.jpg %}
Interesting history. These were fierce, wild people, at least to outsiders.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220501_190640.jpg %}
Home of the Apache.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220501_190815.jpg %}
What a rich culture for such a difficult land.

In the evening I was able to take a shower at the trading post and do laundry.
I couldn't believe I was going to walk 120 miles without a resupply to
Pie Town. Back home in Germany, this long stretch quite intimidated me.
But now it was here.

Lemonhope and I sat at a table with other folks, joking around and drinking
beer and wine. I was determined to get up at 4 anyway and walk north.

## May 2, day 12 - 24.7 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day12.jpg %}
One of my favorite days on the trail, a lonely journey mostly above the Gila
River on a little-used alternate route.

I was so excited to walk. The nearly-full rest day had given me energy.
Lemonhope stayed in his sleeping bag, so I was off alone under the moon
walking up the road a few miles. This was a beautiful moment. Everything
felt both wild and *right*. That I'm in the right place for this
never-before seen moment. I mentally said thanks for the experience.
God is watching, and when I feel both grateful and powerful, then He
is pleased, for I am partaking in His nature. That is how He is.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03911.jpg %}
Early morning, looking back to Doc Campbells.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03921.jpg %}
An interesting spiny lizard.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_065630.jpg %}
Looking down on Little Bear Canyon.

I turned onto a trail and climbed up through scrub trees. I surprised
a javelina (a small wild pig) sitting on a rock. He sprang away
deftly; tough, hogback-ridge back, pointy snout and scurrying legs.

Between that exciting event, and the holy feeling before dawn, I didn't
really want to interact with people that much today. Therefore I decided
to stay on this trail above the river for as long as possible. I dropped down
in the late afternoon, because there is just no water up here. This meant
that I missed the famous hot springs in the canyon. But I didn't mind.
I had this whole forest to myself and felt like a king.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03913.jpg %}
This might be Point 6852 above Little Bear Tank, but there were several cliffs
like this.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_083719.jpg %}
The Gila River snakes along before me.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_090608.jpg %}
Magical country, adjusted to fire. All the trees have endured it.

All the trees in this country are scarred by fire. It's kind of a good thing
when a light fire comes through and burns away undergrowth. It prevents
bigger fires. Still, it would be scary to be in here during a serious fire.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03923.jpg %}
The Meadows area of the canyon below me.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_095430.jpg %}
Looking down to the Meadows from the canyon rim.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_095440.jpg %}
I rested here a while. You can see high northern grasslands far in the
distance.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03918.jpg %}
A fire-adjusted forest. I'd hate to be here in July. For now the temperature
is pleasant.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_120106.jpg %}
A place called Prior Cabin. I hoped to find water here, but there was none.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03928.jpg %}
I couldn't get enough of this forest. It felt like a magical place. Absolutely
no one seen up here all day.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03930.jpg %}
I had it all to myself.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03934.jpg %}
Heading down into the canyon.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_150119.jpg %}
Down in the Gila...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_150324.jpg %}
I'm getting a little tired of sloshing along with wet shoes and socks!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_151546.jpg %}
The rock reminds me of Smith Rocks in Oregon...volcanic.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03940.jpg %}
On the canyon floor.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03941.jpg %}
Impressive walls and cold flowing water.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220502_170335.jpg %}
At least it's cool down here.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03942.jpg %}
I stopped in the middle of the river to take this picture.

On the opposite side of the river, somewhere in this stretch, there was a
great cave which looked like a good campsite. I imagined a fire
there. People had seen bears in the Gila, and that cave seemed a
"bearish" place.

I don't remember if I caught up to him, or he caught up to me, but
I met someone new here. A man from Louisiana called Gator, who came
with a dog. We walked for about an hour in and out of the stream,
then found a good camp alongside the trail: flat ground lightly
strewn with pine needles in widely spaced trees, with water a few
paces away in the river. He was cowboy camping, and I set up my
tarp. We talked about what got us into this life and why we like it.
I believe he's a welder.

A bit later, Brainstorm and Tall Son walked by. As usual with Tall Son,
we continued some running joke. It's really fun to see people
again. They said a woman was camping in that cave I saw earlier.

## May 3, day 13 - 27 miles

Gator, the dog and I started early, walking a couple hours before breakfast.
He carried the dog to protect her paws. Really sweet.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day13.jpg %}
From the river out to broad grassland and more adventures.
The longest day of the trail at 27 miles.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220503_063511.jpg %}
Good morning, friendly camp fella!

The dog is ferried across most crossings.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03949.jpg %}
Snow Lake! Finally! Hmm. Not very snowy.

The lake is underwhelming! But there was a camping area with a water spigot
and a bathroom. What a luxury! Two men stood outside a Winnebago grilling
meat. They were somewhat guarded in response to my friendly hello. One of
them asked how far I'd walked today, and I said about 10 miles. Maybe I
looked too wild or stank of the river and the pines.

I enjoyed sitting on concrete after washing my feet and socks...getting all
the river sand out. Fresh water that I didn't have to filter? Ahh...amazing.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220503_130238.jpg %}
Climbing up to the grasslands.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03952.jpg %}
My feet were sore but it was an interesting new kind of country here, open,
grassy and hilly.

Gator came up to enjoy the water spigot and we said goodbye. I never saw him
again but I hope he had a marvellous trip. I was excited to walk straight
north again, and, following a road for a few miles, soon found myself on
trail in a narrow, grassy canyon. It was hot, with a hot wind, and legs were
sore. But soon I came to a great pond with a few cows milling around.
I probably got water here (strange that I don't remember!), then climbed
steeply up to a crest.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220503_133809.jpg %}
Marvellous broad country.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220503_134717.jpg %}
Lunchtime up on the plateau.

I'd been dreaming about this grassland. It is really something. It marks
a fundamental change. North of the grassland, you are in mountains for a long
while. South of it is desert and the Gila river canyon. I like walking when
I can see so far, and when the land is so pleasingly shaped and curved.

After a couple hours though, I was climbing up into forest on a road. A Forest
Service truck came by, and a man said there was fire ahead. He said his partner
would "ferry" me past the fire. I was disheartened at this, thinking
(rather selfishly) about my "continuous footpath" to Canada. I wondered about
trying to get around the area by traveling cross-country. But frankly, I
didn't have the will-power for that. I had just enough will-power to put one
foot in front of the other without having to think too much -- at least this
late in the afternoon!

An hour later I reached the crest of the road in this forest and saw a hive
of activity. A friendly man invited me to hop into a truck. "How long before
I can walk again?" I asked. "About 2 miles down the road," he said. He'd
been ferrying hikers for two days. "The fire is almost burned out, we'll probably
leave tomorrow."

Strong men, and I say that because seriously, these dudes looked like pirates
with shaven heads and thick necks, worked with shovels and picks amid
smoking remnants of tree stumps, the ground burned black all around. There must
have been twenty people all over the slope on the right side of the road.
I reasoned that I could have walked on the left side in the forest if I was
really keen.

"One guy came back in tears last night. It hurt him so much to lose his
continuous footpath that he returned and asked if there was any way he could
walk the road. So I ferried him back up, then let him walk it while I drove
behind him."

"Wow," I said, impressed by the mans generosity at crawling along the road at
2 miles per hour, and a little embarrassed at the nature of my tribe. I
decided I was glad that I could accept the ferry ride without being too tortured.

The driver said that he used to work in an office with computers in a big city,
but moved back here and joined the Forest Service. He was at peace with everything.
What a fantastic character.

He let me out and wished me luck. I was at the edge of the forest, now walking
due north again, full of good feelings from that interaction. Repeatedly on
this trip, I found that in a land with fewer people, individuals "live larger"
and there is more room for their story. The story of a man or woman out here
occupies a larger penumbra around them, more visibly affecting everything they
touch. They leave greater impressions on you. And the spacious character of
the land seems to belong to them, as well. Their interior spaces are more
expansive, somehow. You pick that up in their slow, courteous replies. There
is nothing to get excited about. The land is too big for that.

I navigated some crossroads, then became keenly interested in my next water source,
which was called Collins Park Tank, and about a 1/2 mile off the road. I followed
a game trail off into the prairie to get to it in order to avoid a sharp bend
and extra steps on the road. I recognized several footprints.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220503_183004.jpg %}
This water was tricky to get, climbing into the tank.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03960.jpg %}
I'm beat! The day ends in a road walk back into mountains.

On the Guthook app, there were complex instructions for getting running water from
the tank. There was a solar panel and various electrical cables and switches
all around it. But nothing I tried worked, so finally I had to climb into the
depleted tank and sit on an oil drum, dipping my water bag into the greenish
water below. I filtered one bag into two bottles, then refilled. By this time
it was early evening. The wind was strong and shadows grew long. I left the
strange tank, knowing this water would have to last me until a tank on the
side of Wagontongue Mountain, nearly twenty miles hence.

I walked another two miles from the tank as the land started to climb and
trees began encroching on the prairie. I'd put in about 25 miles and my
head was reeling with the different kinds of country I'd come through. From
a morning sloshing through the Gila, to the lake then a grand prairie...to
a forest and a forest fire, back to prairie and now forest again. Whew!

I set up my tarp just off the road in the trees and watched the sun go
down. What a day.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03963.jpg %}
It's colder now, so I'm using my tarp.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03964.jpg %}
Goodnight, New Mexico...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03966.jpg %}
Just a lonely, gorgeous place as the sun goes down.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03967.jpg %}
Last light.

## May 4, day 14 - 23.5 miles

Easy walking on a road this morning, for which I was grateful. The old
body is quite stiff after a hard day! I saw a lot of people today,
relatively. First, a couple of guys, one from Germany. He was
generally pessimistic...feet hurt, legs hurt. Even as I agreed with his
entirely valid complaints, I guarded my own thoughts against thinking too
much about the many pains. Do that enough, and you'll be on the next plane
out, I thought! Indeed, when I left the trail near the Wyoming border, I
must have entered a similarly negative space, at least partially.

Alone for a while, I reached the crest of the road at a pass. I was
in the Tularosa Mountains. Interestingly, the official trail was on a ridge
just above me. I hadn't been on the official CDT since a few miles north
of Silver City. The official trail avoids the entire Gila River Canyon,
sticking to waterless hogback ridges of the Gila National Forest off to
the east. Very few people go that way. There is apparently a 40 mile stretch
without water, which is kind of unsettling. But at the crest, I was
again on the Continental Divide, and soon on trail again. Though I got
a bit lost for a few minutes amid some fences and dirt paths.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day14.jpg %}
Some tiring up and down country, then over Wagontongue Mountain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220504_105418.jpg %}
The wind was blowing fiercely up here and the trail started going up and
down on a narrow ridge.

The next hours were interesting. Strong wind on the ridges, which moseyed
up and down until I was pretty beat. The trail cut an interesting path, moving
slyly along the side of a ridge but sometimes climbing steeply up or down
to crests. I met a couple of guys in here, also an interesting older woman
who moved slowly, as she said, but steadily.

I rounded John Kerr Peak on the right side, then had the choice of staying
on the divide by climbing up to a ridge or taking an easier line through
forest that had a water source. This was a no-brainer: go for the water and
save the legs! A mix of dirt roads led northeast and eventually a huge
pond, very much visited by cows.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03968.jpg %}
I think this might have been the Todd Cienega Tank. We had to balance on
a log in the water to get away from the stagnant, gross part of the pond
where all the cows were wading. It looks hot, yeah? But strangely, while
sitting here and eating in the shade, I got cold.

As I got going again I had a little puzzle to keep things interesting. The
trail that gets up to the ridge of Wagontongue is apparently confusing.
I saw a host of comments by infuriated people who lost an hour or two in
here, and others with sometimes conflicting pieces of advice about it.
In the end, there was no problem, though I did see some points where someone
might walk straight ahead but in error. I was in forest, unable to see very
far, and the folded nature of the land made it easy to lose a sense of
direction.

Happily it all worked out and I hobbled (sore feet!) onto an obvious ridge
crest, soon reaching the high point of the day near the summit of Wagontongue
Mountain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03973.jpg %}
The view down from high on Wagontongue Mountain was so impressive, so
expansive. This picture doesn't do it justice. The way down was steep
and marked by switchbacks.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220504_183835.jpg %}
My camp for the night on the north side of Wagontongue Mountain.

By this point, I was really tired. The view was amazing, and I admired the
switchbacks coming down. I was also impressed by the chaos of the forest.
Downed trees lying at all angles and thick brambles in many places. This was
foreshadowing for the rugged forested mountains of Colorado. It probably
planted a seed of fear in me. When you think about bears, you imagine slowly
backing away, or moving rapidly away, depending on the situation. But suppose
a bear is on the trail and you have to come into forest like this...all sharp
sticks, big logs, odd angles. You really can't move quickly, quietly or
with anything like grace. But the bear can!

I wouldn't know it until the morning, but a huge bear walked by my tarp in
the night. Heh.

## May 5, day 15 - 24.1 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day15.jpg %}
Similar to the day before...a long walk to Mangas Mountain, then a heartbreaking,
rough walk over ankle-breaker rocks.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220505_073555.jpg %}
Bear AND mountain lion prints on the trail in the morning. The bear had
come through sometime in the night, padding right by my tarp which was just off
the trail.

I woke, packed up and started out. My goal was a water tank about 5 miles away,
which would give me enough water to make it to a water cache usually in
place thanks to a trail angel that lived nearby, at the base of Mangas Mountain.
I saw the bear and cougar prints in the picture above, and was suddenly
much more alert for the next hour of walking.

I reached the tank, took off my shoes and socks and hung out for a while
to filter and drink water. Happily there weren't any cows nearby and the
water was quite clean. After another mile or so I reached a road, Highway
12. There was a truck here and several people milling around. I met
Shotgun and Critter as they hopped out of the truck and said hi. Apparently
there is a town nearby that some hikers stay at to break up the 120 mile
walk to Pie Town. There was another guy, Abe Lincoln. He really looked like
Lincoln, too! He and I walked together a while, though I was sweating to
keep up with him. I was fascinated with him because he walked the
Black Mountains instead of going through the Gila. He said that in the
middle of the 40 mile waterless stretch he met a man carefully looking at
plants. He was amazed by that, because as for himself, he was extremely
cognizant of the lack of water, and was hurrying through!

Abe Lincoln must be a legendary hiker. He was going so fast, and this was
his second time on the CDT. I believe he'd done all the other trails, too.
For his part, he found my tales of mountain climbing fascinating, so I guess
we had a good trade. Finally I let him go. I *might* have seen him again in
Chama, but my memory is fuzzy.

After Abe went ahead I could slow down and enjoy the forest. It was pretty
nice. Rolling terrain covered in pines with dirt tracks snaking through it.
It was sunny but not too hot. Later I was on a paved road and passed by
the Valle Tio Vinces campground. I think there was a truck there. On the
other side of the road there was supposed to be a water cache. I ended up
wasting 30 minutes looking all over a hillside for it, going up and down.
Eventually I gave up, wondering what I was going to do about water, then
sure enough, by a big shade tree I stumbled on the cache with a couple
of people sitting there around the white plastic water containers.

We joked about that a while. I'd met some of the people the day before.
Oh, there was one really cool older guy. He and I started out together
walking east upslope towards Mangas. I can't remember his story, but it
was compelling. We had a deep philosophical conversation. Mind refreshed,
I waved goodbye and headed up the switchbacks towards the summit. There is
a fire lookout tower on the summit, but according to app comments, they don't
want hikers to bother them. This was the highest point so far on the trail
at 9,600 feet, though the views were mostly blocked by trees. I was feeling
pretty tired, but I wanted to get down to a lower elevation to camp.
I turned off the main road onto a nightmarish track that was so uncomfortable
to walk on. Every rock was toaster sized and highly moveable. I had to
look at my feet the whole time to avoid getting hurt, and even then it felt
like I could sprain an ankle. Over the next two hours, I was always
looking for ways to get off the track into forest on the side, and I might
have done that once or twice, but always ended up back on the track.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03974.jpg %}
This is probably in Barreras Canyon, a mix of dirt road and trail leading
to the water cache near the Valle Tio Vinces Campground west of Mangas
Mountain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03977.jpg %}
The view on Mangas Mountain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220505_180908.jpg %}
I took this picture in frustration, feet and legs hurting with every step.
The problem with building a road on this terrain is that it just exposes rubble,
and the road turns to rubble after only a few seasons. I kept looking left
and right to see if I could walk off the road to save my feet from the
"ankle-breaker" rocks.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03978.jpg %}
My camp for the night, much like the previous night, in that I hobbled down
from a peak to lower country and just collapsed.

I stopped when I just couldn't walk anymore. But at least I knew the road
would improve within a mile or two. I actually had to move my camp. First I
camped at Lower Cat Tank, a dried-up water source. But as I got my sleeping
bag out and ate dinner I realized mosquitoes were beginning to swarm. I
reasoned that the tank had had water until recently, and all the bugs were
the "leftovers" from that heyday some days or weeks before. Argh...I knew I
wouldn't sleep with them swarming around, so I packed up and moved a quarter
mile down the road. No bugs here. That made sense to me...those bugs have
to have water to live.

## May 6, day 16 - 22 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day16.jpg %}
The delightful Davila Ranch, then a road walk to Pie Town.

It was heaven walking on the broader road. I didn't know if I'd make it to
Pie Town today, but I was excited about the Davila Ranch, which supposedly
had amenities for hikers in a "self-service" kind of way. I figured I might
just stay there for the night.

I got to the ranch to discover 2 or 3 tin sheds, each with a different
service. One was a shower. Another a washer and drier, and the last one
a full kitchen. A few other people were here, and we were all tickled pink
with this wonderful surprise.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220506_101204.jpg %}
I had no idea how wonderful these little tin sheds would be!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220506_120638.jpg %}
I've cooked myself some eggs and potatoes. I'm freshly showered and my clothes
are in the washer. My phone is downloading messages. This place had everything
a hiker could want!

Later, one of the ranchers who maintains the place came by with a few dozen
eggs for the fridge. He said that frankly, they made this place because
without it, injured or lost hikers kept appearing at odd places in the
ranchland around here, knocking on doors and needing help. The ranchers never
knew where to take the hikers. So they built the Davila Ranch as a magnet
to corral wayward hikers. Ranchers could bring them here, and they could
get a ride to town later. He also told me why that road I hated so much the
day before was like that. He said you can't build dirt roads here. The rain
comes and just uncovers another layer of rubble. Soon it's a deep trough
of toaster-sized rocks. He said hunters come from Texas and ask for a road.
It gets built, but is worthless after only a few years. I can attest to that!

After my shower, my clean clothes, the wi-fi, and a lunch of eggs and potatoes,
I was full of energy. I decided to walk to Pie Town.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03985.jpg %}
I've really tried to figure out what the name of this peak is. There was
nothing to look at for most of the road walk to Pie Town except this.
But it's tough to find out anything about it. Was it a mirage, captured on
film from my overheated brain waves?

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220506_191923.jpg %}
Good evening Toaster House! Hikers often receive new shoes here and say goodbye
to the old pair. I've lost the name of the nice young fella eating something
there. Note that the "couch" is made of seats from a van.

I got there in the evening to something like a party. There must have been
30 or 40 hikers here. I was hoping for a bunk in the house, but I just had
to make due with crashing on the lawn. Happily I didn't need a shower or
laundry, thanks to the hospitality of the Davila Ranch (I sent them a donation
with PayPal). I broke my 8 month vegetarian streak with some soup at the
Pie Town house...it just smelled so good.

Go Go and Blueberry were here. I sat with them and a few others, joking and
drinking some beer that the German man I saw a few days before had bought.
He decided to go home now so he could enjoy the summer in the Alps. These
mountains were just a bit too punishing and colorless in comparison with
the Swiss peaks. I definitely understood...though I was enjoying that
lonely aspect of the challenge, at least so far!

## May 7, day 17 - 16 miles


{% image /cmaimages/2022/day17.jpg %}
A long walk directly north to a friendly rancher's property.

*The blog covers a few days around here in [At Davila Ranch](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/at-davila-ranch.html).*

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_073316.jpg %}
The Pie Town Post Office.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_073732.jpg %}
They had my box shipped from Silver City! Good, because there are NO stores.

I got up very early off the ground and sat in the kitchen with other folks
and bonded over coffee. I met Stephan here, an experienced hiker with
interesting thoughts about how our food needs would change as we entered
the mountains. Basically, a LOT more calories are required every day. I found
him to be absolutely right about this. And the weight of authority he
brought to the argument made it easier for me to accept the heavier food
bag in Colorado.

Stephan is also a Christian, full of the felt love of God, and wonder at
the way He works in the world. He was the first Christian I met, and we spent
the morning talking rapidly. I got my post office box and came back. Then
we went to breakfast together at the pie restaurant. Stephan had many thoughts
on the economy, including an impending collapse. I challenged him on
certain assumptions. But generally we had an enjoyable back and forth.
Stephan was one of the great gifts of the trail.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_105432.jpg %}
Me and Stephan. We bonded over pie. What a cool dude.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_110415.jpg %}
My free slice of pie in Pie Town! Oh man, it was good.

I was planning to have a full rest day, but the great rest the day before
at the Davila Ranch, combined with the continual crowd at the Toaster
House was making me reconsider. Friendly hiker Low Branch was sleeping in
a bunk, and offered to give it to me when he took off later in the day.
But then he announced he'd stay another day, so I was looking at sleeping
outside again. That cinched it: I'd head out in the afternoon and make for
a friendly ranch property 12 miles north where I could set up my tarp and
drink their water.

I packed for four days, leaving some of my supplies in the house for others
to use. Generally, I brought one more day of food than I thought I needed
for most stretches, and was comfortable with that. I could begin nibbling
on those stores once beyond the halfway point if I was ahead of schedule.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_112101.jpg %}
Inside the Toaster House. I'd ended 7 months of vegetarianism the day before
with eggs at the Davila Ranch, and then some mystery soup someone made in
the Crock Pot visible in the picture. I just couldn't resist it...and it
had chicken.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_121017~2.jpg %}
I'm ready to set off with 4 days of food to reach Grants. Skinnier, sunburned
and tougher after so many nights sleeping on the ground.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220507_164833.jpg %}
This fantastic man on the left came by in an AT vehicle with a silver pitcher
of cold water for us. He said he's the only white man who owns land in this
stretch. Brainstorm smiling in the middle.

On the walk north, Brainstorm and I spent a good two hours talking. It got
quite heated! I'm afraid I was picking on him a bit. You see, we'd been walking
and a trail angel pulled up with a silver container of ice cold water. We
talked to the man for a while, and he went on his way. As he drove away,
Brainstorm said "it's all about love." I heartily agreed. But a minute later,
he said that Jeff Bezos should be hung by his neck until he is dead.

"Why?" I asked.

Brainstorm invoked the aching hordes of millions, groaning under the yoke
of the great, satanic capitalist lord. I didn't buy it. I said that we
like the things Amazon does for us, and so WE made him rich. If it weren't
for us, he wouldn't be a great satan. And is he such a satan, anyway?

Brainstorm had never heard arguments like this, I think, and was incredulous.
"How can you say these things?" Our argument raged like a summer storm from
one side of the landscape to another. At one point I mentioned God and spirit,
probably trying to defend my way of looking at things. But this was
doubly offensive. First I'd defended a satan, now I was trying to "foist"
motivations or beliefs onto him, and I didn't have the right to do that.

"Okay, fine. Then let's take your view of things. The world groans under
oppression. And there is nothing but chemical material. When we die we
become nothingness, and nothing is learned. Here is my question:"

"When you achieve your end. When all the 'satans' have been hung. What
will happen? Because...don't you see that the satans came from the people,
and are raised up by the people, too? For how many milliseconds will your
utopia endure before it's back to fighting?"

He didn't answer this. He was still trying to convince me that Bezos is
evil. At this point I finally called it quits. The examples were becoming
either cartoonish or insulting, it is hard to tell which (one that
Brainstorm forwarded was quite pungent: 'how can you say that this man, who
murders *your own sons* in his factories, who...'. He was trying to
overwhelm reason with ever-more emotional appeals, a natural strategy
but increasingly ineffective).

So we gave it up. Here Brainstorm did a remarkable thing. He said, "let's
be friends," and gave me a big bear hug right there in the middle of this
lonely New Mexico road. He is very tall, so I felt rather helpless! He gave
me a kind smile, and I admired his ability to express kindness to one such
as me who must have filled him with perplexity and confusion.

After that, at the ranch, we looked at each other and grinned with some
depth that couldn't have been there before. We knew each other in some
fundamental way. I guess he thought I was certifiably insane. But I couldn't
not like him. He is a cool guy. We won't talk about these things anymore!
But he's a cool guy nonetheless.

Stephan showed up a bit later, and he and I stayed up late talking of many
things. He and I had become the politically incorrect duo, I think. But
I didn't care. It wasn't that Stephan shared my views. It was that he
was willing to use his imagination and see the playing out of his own
views across space and time. That kind of "play" is one of my favorite
activities. Brainstorm and I were doing that to a degree, but the emotions
were a bit too high for comfort.

I've heard it said that humans are willing to go one, maybe two steps out of
their comfort zone but three steps is just impossible. With Brainstorm and
I, it was a "2.5 step" conversation...often difficult! With Stephan and I,
we ranged between 0 and 2. Easy, and therefore we could exchange a lot of
information quickly.

## May 8, day 18 - 23.2 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day18.jpg %}
A long road walk, then a trip through Armijo Canyon to a camp in Cebolla
Canyon.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03987.jpg %}
It's 6 am, and the hikers are moving north.

Mile after mile, a straight road. I didn't find it boring. I liked thinking
about the blue mountains in the distance. What would it be like in them?
How would I traverse or avoid them? What strange camps in odd gullies
lay ahead? I generally have a lot to think about and am happy with this
kind of terrain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03989.jpg %}
It's 8:45 am, and we're still going.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03990.jpg %}
A hiker has left the road, turning due east into Armijo Canyon.

I had a fun talk with Apples in here, a tall woman dedicated to adventure
with her husband Man Hands. We chatted about podcasts, blisters and
sports training and motivation. I think they live in Hawaii.

Finally off the road, I was moving east on sandy trail into a canyon
with an abandoned cabin. There were interesting rock structures, too. Though
it was getting pretty hot and I was eager for the water tank.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03995.jpg %}
A colorful rock face near the abandoned cabin in Armijo Canyon.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220508_123224~2.jpg %}
The abandoned cabin.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC03998.jpg %}
Beautiful rock formations of Armijo.

At the tank which was reached after a short climb, I took off shoes and socks,
resting and filtering water in a little patch of shade. I think someone
walked by, choosing a different place to get water from in the lake.

As afternoon turned to early evening, I was beginning to hobble. I entered
the Cebolla Wilderness and came to a larger road. I had notice of a
water cache sometimes being here, but there was nothing. I pressed on just
a bit further and found a flat place to camp partially under some bushes.

It's funny, I left my container of refried beans sitting out in the sun
near the trail and Patches and Emma came by, wondering about it. I walked up and
retrieved it and they laughed. They camped just a bit farther on, and I
waved to them in the morning.

An uneventful night.

## May 9, day 19 - 22 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day19.jpg %}
Up early for water, then an adventure hiking cross country, then a long
road walk.

*The [blog entry](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/through-cebola-canyon.html)
tells of this section as well.*

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04001.jpg %}
It's 5:45 am, and thirst drove me out of my sleeping bag to walk a few miles
to the next water supply.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04002.jpg %}
This tank felt more valuable than gold. Cool, clear water!

At the water tank, Si Nombre walked up. He and I would have a fun day together!
We shared a taste in films, and were both rabid fans of Synecdoche, NY,
the Philip Seymor Hoffman film which questions the nature and purpose of
reality. Si Nombre is an engineer.

There was an adventure on the menu for the day: going up onto the canyon rim
and getting close-up looks of an interesting natural arch. The view was said
to be amazing up there. There was also an exciting cross-country traverse to
get down from the rim, and we had some beta on it. Back at Doc Campbells Post,
the man who gave Lemonhope and I a ride to the Cliff Dwellings had explained
the way to me carefully, so I was sure I knew what to do.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04004.jpg %}
We've climbed up onto the canyon rim of the the Narrows.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04009.jpg %}
Si Nombre got a picture of me walking on the rim.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04014.jpg %}
The harsh lava flats below were impressive.

This enormous black scar of lava, so visible in satallite photos, was a
hiding place where the spanish settlers could hide out from indians...or
the other way around. There are caves and all kinds of stuff in here.
I'd had my fill of lava fields a month before in the Canary Islands so I
gave it a pass. "Seen one, seen 'em all," was my thought :).

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04016.jpg %}
The impressive natural arch.

We reached an overlook, took some pictures and thought we spied a line to
get down. Soon we were moving quickly further along the rim and within 20
minutes we were in the area.

Now followed a frustrating 45 minutes of climbing down, up, back and forth, down
again. We just couldn't find it. We found ourselves standing on cliffs with
vertical drops of 40+ feet below us. Or on highly uncertain scrambling
terrain that gave us no reason to think there was any kind of way down.
And every option was tried at least twice.

In the heat of the day, with limited water, we needed to call it quits.
We decided to travel cross country several miles until the cliffs naturally
petered out. So the adventure continued. I would usually set the line to
follow, with Si Nombre in front. We dropped into valleys and climbed out
the other side, often side-hilling in an attempt to keep moving north.

Si Nombre was faster than me, and could have probably gone on ahead, but it
felt weird to separate here way off the trail, so we stuck together. We were
relieved to come on a road that led easily down in a valley with "Ruins"
marked on the USGS topo map.

We crossed a fence and were back on the road, somewhat relieved, though knowing
that all the time up there had been costly. We'd also likely missed a
reliable water cache said to be at a pull out beneath the natural arch, but since that was
almost two miles back, we decided to forget about it.

Through the rest of the journey, I'd run into people, and no one ever had
trouble getting down from that cliff top. It was a very interesting mystery!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220509_123540.jpg %}
Si Nombre on our hunt for the way down from the cliff-top.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04021.jpg %}
Again from another view. We'd been told there was a way down here, but
we just couldn't find it so we had to stay high and travel cross country for
a few hours before we could get down to the road.

Si Nombre and I rested under some schrubs on the road, then he headed off
to the west to cross the El Malpais lava field for an interesting "lava"
variation to the CDT. I was happy with the road. The next time we'd see
each other was in Colorado above Cumbres Pass, but we might have said hello
in Chama.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04025.jpg %}
Impressive rock faces of the Little Narrows.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04026.jpg %}
A long road walk to the ranger station for the night.

I walked along the road for 11+ miles. By the time I got to the ranger
station I was very tired. The station was closed due to COVID, but there was
a water spigot and some shade. Also some park benches. Wonderful! Amazing!
It feels so civilized to sit on a table and drink fresh water in the shade
with a light breeze, instead of hiding under shrubs, drinking greenish water,
and avoiding painful spiny plants.

Patches and Emma came up and we talked about classical music and things like that.
I went around to the area of a maintenence shed and unrolled my sleeping
bag to sleep under the stars. It was a good night.

## May 10, day 20 - 15 miles

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day20.jpg %}
15 miles of road walking, what can I say? I got a delicious Subway sandwich
that made the last 6 miles more pleasant.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220510_094755.jpg %}
Interstate 90, one of the most important roads in America.

There is not much to say about such a long road walk. The journey is inside.
I did have some interesting realizations, and included them on the blog.
But mainly I remember blue sky, with black lava on the left and cliffs on
the right. The road was a good, paved highway and there were various interactions
with cars where they came too close, or were generous and moved over a bit
or waved. The cars seemed to become less friendly though, with the improvement
in pavement.

Coming to interstate 90, I went into a Subway shop, which, I guess because
of the native american culture was deep in spring 2020 era COVID response.
A Mask was required to go in. Luckily, they had masks at the door. The
native americans who drove up all wore masks alone in their cars. Very strange!
But I sat in front and ate my sandwich happily with a couple of hitchhikers
with interesting stories. We "road bums" have to stick together!

I set out for another 6 miles to reach town. Here I was getting bored! The
cliffs above me on the right were interesting though, because I knew that
the first 11,000 foot mountain was behind them, and that was my next major
milestone.

I'd already reserved a room and had something shipped there. Maybe new shoes?
Strange how quickly I forget these things. I was across from Taco Bell and
Walmart...an ideal place for a hiker!

I went in and immediately ordered a take-out pizza and got my clothes in the
laundry. Ahh. Shower!

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220510_195230~2.jpg %}
Me with Blueberry and Go Go on the right. Darn it I forgot the name of the
nice fella on my left.

Blueberry and Go Go heard I had a swimming pool and decided to come by for
a visit. That was fun! Blueberry explained how to pop a blister safely.
It may sound crazy, but I'd never done that. I had a blister on my heel that
needed this treatment, because no matter how I taped it, it would fill with
liquid. So I'd have to beat my right heel into submission. Blueberry's
blister trouble was ongoing, but nothing would stop her, that is for sure.

## May 11, day 21 - 0 miles

The next morning I had breakfast with Nico, who'd seen at the Davila Ranch.

*And here I'll just continue quoting from the [blog entry](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/05/new-friends-in-grants.html), because I think I told
pretty well the events of the interesting day...*

Getting around in Grants is odd. There is no uber or taxi. However there is a
really cool nearly free shuttle service called the Rockin 66 Express. You call
and schedule a pickup and possibly a trip back home. I used it twice to get to
the post office, which saved me at least 2 hours of walking, which I don't want
to do right now! Both days, David picked me up and I learned his story. He's a
member of the Yaqui tribe, and a fairly recent arrival in Grants. He and his
wife lived in California, and moved here after their car broke down in town,
and he made use of the Rockin 66 to get around. He was already a bus driver,
and was offered a job here. Perfect!

We had to stop at the battered woman's shelter, a nice-enough building
surrounded by heavy gates and barbed-wire. David said that a mother and her son
were there. He gave them some rides over a few days, and the boy didn't want to
leave the bus and go back to the building. That made sense to me because David
is a kind of "home" of a man who projects safety and kindness. Well, this got
to him. He spoke to the pastor of his church, and as it turns out, she was able
to take the mother and the boy in to her home.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220511_132805~2.jpg %}
A wonderful couple.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220511_132832~2.jpg %}
What an honor to be invited to his home.

She eventually moved away, and by some magic the pair were able to stay in that
home, and since became members of the community...the mom got a job and the boy
went to school.

Um...this is something I'm seeing more and more. People, like David, who speak
about the glory of God and their thankfulness, are often worried about others.
Often looking out for ways to help. You see...they've felt lifted up when they
ALSO felt undeserving of being lifted up...and my goodness...when that happens:
your idea of what the world is never recovers its old, dismal stability with
you at the helm.

So their eyes become attuned to the course of the "undeserving" drifting
through town like tumbleweeds. They ask themselves "where is she sleeping?" Or
"How many days since that kid sat at a dinner table?"

THIS becomes their "Spotify playlist." At their best, they become a part of the
network of sunlight, fresh air and soil nutrients that even in this high desert
allow trees to grow. It makes me wonder about the inner life of sunlight. For
if a tiny piece of that energy so alters the flow of a human life, what is the
feeling inside the purest form of that giving light?

Anyhow, today Kathrin, Mountain Goat and I were again in the shuttle with
David, and as he took us back over to near the Walmart, he said that he needed
to give us something. Stopping at his house, he invited us quickly inside. We
met his wonderful wife and admired the many bird feathers and other symbols on
the walls. He related that his band fought with Pancho Villa against the
Americans, hoping to regain their land. Later, Villa began selling land to
Americans for money, so the Yaqui broke with him, at least in part. This
"breaking" divides families of the tribe to this day. David chose his bride 44
years ago, enduring rancor because she was from a family on the other side of
that fight.

In this way, they became a living symbol of what they want to do with their
life. He gave us his business card, which names him as "Personal Fence
Builder." When I read that I hear "mender." That is...borders are real. But
they don't have to divide us. They could be our connectors as well. And I think
that's what he means.

David gave us owl feathers, beautifully embedded in jewelry of green and
turquoise. It was a blessing.

*So I slept feeling refreshed and fulfilled. Ready to start before dawn
for the climb of Mount Taylor!*
