### Lake 22, April, 2004
Carlos told me that this was a great easy hike with spectacular views from
the lake, so when Kris and I had the afternoon free, I jumped at the chance for us
to go there. We started hiking around 2 pm, and after a long walk through
scenic forest, found ourselves switchbacking up an open hillside. Kris named
a mountain across the valley "Mount Cous-cous." I approved heartily. Once back
in the forest, we continued on packed snow to the lake outlet. Indeed, the
cliffs were spectacular, with a few waterfalls cascading down to the lake.
Kris saw her first avalanche here, when blocks of snow fell away from a high
portion of the wall. The rumbling and roar continued for about 30 seconds.
A family teetered across a log to a trail on the other side of the outlet.
The sun was warm, and Kris enjoyed her packet of "Corn Gone Wrong." We headed
down, talking about all sorts of things. We stopped to rest on a bridge over
the raging river. It was a fun trip!
