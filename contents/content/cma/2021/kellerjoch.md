With a day of good weather, and **newly lasered eyes**, it was time for
a hike. I wanted to get up high in Austria, but wanted to be able to
take a lift down to keep the elevation gain reasonable. I figured with
about 1300 meters up and down I could climb the Kellerjoch from Fügen,
then come down with the lift. As it turned out, my calculations were a bit
off!

But it was a good day anyway. The trail up from the lift station is quite
pleasant. It tries to stick in forest on one side or the other of the lift,
first on the left, then on the right. Beyond the Mittelstation, after a
short steep stretch right under the lift, it beetles off to the right
for a long time. Again, the forests were just fantastic.

Ridiculously pretty flowers looking to the Rofan Mountains.

Note the sheep -- how do they stay attached?! :D

I was listening to an audio book of [Swami Vivekananda's](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda) "Raja Yoga."
I found this book at the beginning of 2019 and it impressed me so much.
His clear description of the relation of modern man to the concept of
religion, and how that concept is a shadow of what it could or should be
was helpful to me. His terse practical outline of a plan of work is motivating.
What an amazing figure he was. Here is a snippet:

> If there is a God we must see Him, if there is a soul we must perceive it;
> otherwise it is better not to believe. It is better to be an outspoke atheist
> than a hypocrite. The modern idea, on the one hand, with the “learned,” is that
> religion and metaphysics, and all search after a Supreme Being, is futile; on
> the other hand, with the semi-educated, the idea seems to be that these things
> really have no basis, that their only value consists in the fact that they are
> strong motive powers for doing good to the world. If men believe in a God, they
> may become good, and moral, and so make good citizens. We cannot blame them for
> holding such ideas, seeing that all the teaching these men get is simply to
> believe in an eternal rigmarole of words, without any substance behind them.
> They are asked to live upon words; can they do it? If they could, I should not
> have the least regard for human nature. Man wants truth, wants to experience
> truth for himself, to grasp it, to realise it, to feel it within his heart of
> hearts; then alone, declare the Vedas, will all doubts vanish, all darkness be
> scattered, and all crookedness be made straight.

This is definitely the shape of things today. My friends mostly hold
religion as nonsense for them, but they see that it can be good or helpful
for "regular people," who might need it to get through the day. And this "it"
they imagine is a collection of statements about doing good and being good
combined with the remaining apparatus of formerly powerful organizations.
Privately, they feel this is a thin gruel on which to feed, but they accept
that by some combination of social inertia and lack of curosity on the part of
the individual, the bundle of ideas continues forward, and there we are.

I'm sorry but this is the attitude of a teenager! That is, when they were
teenagers they worked out this thought pattern, and haven't revisited it since.
I know because I did the same thing. No one looks deeper into a thing which
they believe to be settled. It's possible to grow old and die thinking that
this is what "religion" is.

True religion is science continued by other means. It is the exhaustion of
inquiry into the external world, and the beginning of internal inquiry. All
of the dangers of misapprehension science has thus far elucidated in the
process of external search remain, and are, in fact, greatly magnified. Because
the object of inquiry now is the very apparatus which makes conclusions --
the Mind. Knowing the [observer effect](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect), the rational man will admit
that the work proposed is impossible. True!

Thusly, we attempt to reach, maintain and easily reproduce another state
of consciousness which is able to observe Mind. To watch it emerging from
rabbit holes and descending and dividing into tunnels. Now we can begin
to get a handle on the many distortions of subjective thought that we
habitually encounter.

We seek objectivity. We seek to use the discernment we developed in our years
of inquiry into the external world. That was the training ground, and
now we move onto much more "Real" inquiry.

Why do I apply the word "Real" to that which is most insubstantial -- the
subjective states of consciousness? Well, because it's true. The most real
thing you know are those electrical patterns in the brain which tell you
that a bee hovers just inside in the window. This is an impression in the
thought-space, in that "unreliable instrument" whose investigation we
constantly shy away from, the Mind. If you deny that this is the ground of
reality, then what is it you call the "really-real?" It would be
nonsensical to say that it is those apparently external things **about which
you are only informed through the unreliable medium**. For if it is so
unreliable, how can it serve as a delivery vehicle?

Hmm, young Jedi Master?

LOL. Anyway. Such were my wandering thoughts on this day.

Looking south to higher mountains.

Above the forest, terrain because temporarily depressing with construction
vehicles, a bivy of ski lifts, and wandering, bored families in search of
ice cream spilling out of the lift station (I'm being uncharitable out
of habit -- in fact, many of the people were fit, fast walkers, often
impressively old). But soon "wilderness" began
again. I traversed a high trail above the Geolsalm, then descended
to a basin on the beclouded north side of the rocky Metzenjoch. Feeling
pretty tired, I reascended to the final steep trail to the Kellerjoch
and took a short rest. I was fasting (for some reason...I guess I felt
fat!) and hadn't eaten in about 40 hours. I was really feeling it now.
I made the final hike, and found a summit with a little chapel and
a bunch of folks sitting around. It was a great view. I was about 1700
meters above my start in Fügen.

I hiked keenly down to the nearby Kellerjochhütte, eager for food!
I drank an alcohol-free Weißbier, imagining that alcohol on *such* an
empty stomach would be inappropriate. Here I got greedy and made a mistake,
ordering the richest-looking food available: dumplings ("Knödel").
It was really a bit too rich. I'd never had this
particular kind of red dumpling before, and it tasted odd. I couldn't
quite finish the meal, alas.

But the view from the hut towards Innsbruck was excellent. In general, I
decided this peak and it's grouping of valleys and ridges would become a
favorite in the years to come. The trip back to the Spieljoch lift
station was rather hard. I was limping and eager to reach the lifts.

Finally this was done and I sailed down to the car courtesy of men and
women who didn't mind investigating the external world long enough to
produce hydraulic lifts, steel cables, modern plexiglass windows and
all manner of conveniences!

2100 meters up and about 1000 down thanks to the lift.
