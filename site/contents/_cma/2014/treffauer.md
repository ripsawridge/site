The line of Jubilaeumsweg 2000


Georg and I had a rather disappointing time in the Western Alps, making due with
an attempt on La Meije, and then scrounging around near Ailefroide trying to
climb some rock before persistent rain drove us back home in disgust.

We spent Wednesday driving and making sardonic comments about the weather gods. 
I dropped Georg off at his place, went home and slept. Strangely, Georg managed
to find a weather window: the next day, exactly at the Wilder Kaiser, it
wouldn't be raining. So we had to mount back up and drive over there.

Under blue skies we hiked to the Gruttenhütte. We had two ropes, quickdraws and
some cams, nuts and slings. The route itself was [whimsically set up on
9/19/1999](https://www.stadler-markus.de/alpinklettern/wilder-kaiser/kletterrouten/treffauer/routeninfos/beschreibung/ostpfeiler-jubilaeumsweg-2000.html), 
and is one of the
[longest routes](https://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/tirol/kaiser-gebirge/jubilaeumsweg-2000) in this area of the Kaiser. The authors, two
Haselsberger brothers and a friend H. Pirkner are famous for the group of climbs
on the other side of the peak like ["Via
Romantica"](https://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2009/viaromantica.html) 
and "Blue Moon." We were
interested to see what they did in a "foreign" valley :).

A cloud engulfed us in the great scree basin below the route and never
left. Alas, we wouldn't see the sun or more than 50 meters in front of us for
many hours. This terrible August weather had found us even here. But at least it
remained dry so we continued doggedly. I got irritated with crossing the scree
basin at low height, so I dropped back down to the trail and listened to Georgs
progress to determine where to turn back up. I found it so tiring, and was
disgusted with the cloud. In truth, the main reason I wanted to climb this
route, which I know is not known for it's incredible climbing, was to experience
the big-wall ambience in kind of unknown area. The thick cloud meant that
wouldn't be possible and as I took two steps up, one step back in the enormous
scree field I cursed inwardly. Georg waited patiently above, his traversing plan
having worked much better.

Finally I arrived and sent Georg off to lead the first pitch. We combined the
first three pitches in a long simul-climb to grade IV. Normally this would have
felt easy and routine with bolt protection, but wow...this was an exceptionally
loose mountain! I think the German word "splittrig" describes this situation
pretty well. On the south side of the Wilder Kaiser, many rocks have cracks
throughout, and when you have to treat them as solid blocks a feeling of
insecurity results. Multiply this over entire pitches and the route gets an air
of seriousness...despite the bolts!

Georg had gone up and right on easier ground. I took the next block, turning
left around a corner and straight up again for two grade III pitches to a long
section of walking on grassy ledges. We came together for a moment, then I led
two more pitches of III and II to reach a gray wall, impressive after the long
trip through scruffy ground to get here. Georg led a very nice grade IV pitch up
the wall to a vertical section. I headed up, enjoying the grade V terrain very
much. But at one point I couldn't see the next bolt and wondered which way to
go. Finally I saw it, quite camoflagued! This was an excellent pitch though.
Georg took the V+ pitch that went up an overhanging corner. We felt a few
raindrops and he sped up so as to make it over the crux before solid rain! But
luckily the precip stopped. As I followed a foothold broke while I cleaned some
gear. I think I managed to hold on without stressing the belay but maybe
not. The crack at the overhang was seeping water. This wasn't a really easy
pitch!

I led pitches 13 and 14 as a simul-climb again, confusing Georg by stopping at
the belay for pitch 15. In fact I'd had a pretty strange move here, carefully
crabbing around a rotten tower that partially collapsed under my
weight. Ugh. I have to say, I've been on plenty of loose terrain, but this upper
route really takes the cake. There are so many rocks that crumble or break into
shards if you use them meaningfully. You have to distribute your weight
carefully. With the blowing clouds in our crumbling spires I have to admit the
climb had atmosphere though!

Georg led 15, 16 and 17 as a simul-climb. Though rated II and III, this would be
mentally taxing to solo not only for the extremely loose rock but also
routefinding uncertainty. On the last pitch, a 10 meter section of vertical rock
stretched the definition of grade III, but at least it was very solid.

Now as far as we knew, we were on the Ostgipfel (East Summit). In the cloud, we
didn't really know what to do, only that abseils along the ridge were in our
future.  We climbed uncertainly down in a diagonal direction to a little abcess
among rotten teeth. I set off, traversing the teeth and sometimes slinging the
sharp summits. I reached a tower I did *not* want to have to
downclimb. Occasionally the cloud would lift a bit and we'd see what an airy
place we were in. Georg arrived at my summit and noticed the rappel
anchors. Yay! We were still on route. It was a good thing we had plenty of nuts
and cams. 

We had a single 50 meter rope (yeah, I know :)), and now had to make two
25-meter rappels into the gray murk. Gulp. Happily, this worked
perfectly. Actually we made 3 rappels, and employed some extra caution in face
of the uncertainty: the first person was lowered and the second rappeled once
the way was scouted. This was helpful on the first rappel because I ended up
passing the station and had to climb back up to it on non-trivial terrain. It
was great to have a top rope.

Now we traversed pretty easily across nonetheless dangerous terrain. Georg led
this half-walk half-climb to a belay point at a notch in front of an overhanging
tower. Then I led 3 grade II and III pitches as a long simul-climb to the
summit, first traversing under the overhanging tower, then regaining the ridge
crest. Hilariously, I came upon a single bolt here, long after I'd given up
looking for such strange things! At that moment the clouds opened up for about
15 seconds, giving a panoramic view of huge air, towers and Georg 30 meters
below crabbing up to the crest. Before I could get my camera it was gone, and it
was just me again in the mist. The sound of breathing, the clicking of gear and
careful steps on collapsing ledges. Soon I was at the summit cross, taking a
half turn around it to belay Georg up.

Well. It was interesting!

As we hiked down, we dropped below the cloud, getting enjoyable views of the
Kopfkraxen and other Western Kaiser stuff. Georg pointed out an easy slab climb
on the lower wall. Then I laughed when he said: "I just saw a goat walk across
the crux of this climb."

Now we had a long hike around the south side of Tuxeck until we could follow a
route down to the car at the Wochenbrunner Alm. And thus ends the story of how
we drove for two days looking for something to climb and finally got something
in our own backyard. :).
