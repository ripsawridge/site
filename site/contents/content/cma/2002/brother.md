Saturday night we went to see the comedian Steven Wright, and I really like
his old joke:

* Did you sleep good?
* No, I made a few mistakes.

Back from the show, I started planning a mountain climb for Sunday, but the
forecast was kind of grim. I had noticed in satellite pictures that the cloud
layer was much thinner over the Olympics. The prevailing flow was from the
South, channeled over the Cascades. The Olympics were clear! This got me
excited to visit the range after years of wistfully looking over there.


I decided on the Brothers, and hastily threw my gear in the car, figuring
there was no time to sleep beforehand (I was "Hooding it," named for
the common practice of climbing Mt. Hood Friday after work). For food I brought
fried chicken and small cubes of cheese. I would later regret the lack of
carbohydrates in this fare. I paid slightly more attention to the map, but not
enough. Around 3 am, I was lost on the Key Peninsula, and had to backtrack 10
miles. Finally I arrived at 4 am, and was soon hiking to Lena Lake on
depressingly flat switchbacks. I passed a few tents around the lake, and
entered the Valley of Silent Men. I was too busy climbing fallen trees and
crossing bridges on the way in to notice it much, but enjoyed the trail on the
way out. The huge mossy boulders and splintered trees have a primeval look. The
junction with another creek, or "base camp," is nothing special, just
a flat area in the forest with two feet of snow on the ground. It's very easy
to lose the proper trail in here. I followed tracks in the snow that seemed to
belong to a party of 5, then 4, etc., finally one solitary stubborn man.
Finally it was an all-out bushwhack with occasional bits of pink flagging. Then
it started to rain. The stock of my enterprise was at a low, and I considered a
reverse split. But then the terrain opened up into avalanche chutes, and I
gratefully clambered aboard.


Seven increasingly rugged miles to here, and I hadn't covered half the
required elevation gain of 6200 feet. Now the climbing could begin, first up a
long 30 degree avalanche slope, scarred by thoughtless glissade paths. I really
resented the thought of someone having fun hurtling down the gully and leaving
this environmental scar. My feeling of solitude, protected by law, was
grievously violated! It didn't occur to me to resent the helpful kicked steps,
hmm...


The gully widened and veered rightward. I saw a few people higher up. I also
saw a neat looking gully called the Hourglass. The route descriptions say to
avoid it, due to falling rock and snow. But with crunchy, stable snow, I just
had to climb that thing. Most tracks went down and around to the right, but
someone had been up this before. It was fun to be in the narrow walled couloir.
There was a small moat to step over. Melt-out will make it harder to climb in
the coming weeks.


Above this the gully widened greatly, with a large snow slope on the right.
I went over to it, thinking to join the other folks who went to the right. The
snow was harder up here, so I put on crampons as it began to snow lightly. I
went back into the wide gully and climbed for another 1000 feet, going around a
rocky buttress on the left. Happily, the cloud layer stayed above my peak the
entire trip, so I had good local views. Since I was wet from the rain, a spot
of warm sun would have been much appreciated. But when I examined the steaming
chicken entrails I had brought for this purpose, they revealed that the sun
would never appear today. Never.


An exciting steeper step (45 degrees?) on an exposed slope led me to a
"staging area" 100 feet below the summit. There were 10-15 people
here in various stages of undress. No, but seriously folks, there was a crowd,
with about 7 people heading down and 8 going up. I put on a sweater due to the
cold, strong wind, and followed some people up a steep snow chimney, then on a
trail pounded into loose talus (careful, the staging area is exposed to rock
fall from this trail). I talked with some guys at the summit (10:15 am).
Everyone was glad to be here and see the amazing view into the dark heart of
the Olympics. The range was vignetted by a gray shroud that cropped the highest
peaks, but added to the mystery. Everyone left and I was alone: standing in the
screaming wind, munching hideously on a chicken breast. I contemplated the
traverse to the North Peak, which was very steep getting down from the South
Peak. Better to go the other way, I think, and I would take a rope.


With a mad cackle I retraced my steps, eventually passing the descending
parties. I watched a few people attempt to glissade the very hard snow with
crampons on. I did mention something about the danger of this to them, but had
to be tactful. I said "Dang, I'd like to glissade, but I'd have to take
off my crampons, and I want them for the Hourglass!" I believe they quit
the attempt, but I didn't stick around to find out. I removed crampons and went
for some really fast rides below the Hourglass. Down to the brush, and a better
trail. Soon I was on the flats of "base camp," but I got disoriented
among the hundreds of tracks going every direction. After wasting 15 minutes, I
got out the compass and map. Due east led me to the river, then south along
it's bank to the fork. Another guy heard me scrabbling around upstream and
called out to check on me (thanks!). I took a rest at the fork while he
and his partner packed up their camp, then I took off for Lena Lake. Once
there, I rested on an overlook of the lake, napping happily. That done, I
pounded down to the car, fuming at the low angle switchbacks. I was there at
3:45, so it was an 11.5 hour day.


At the car a forest ranger was waiting for me. He asked for my license and
social security number. I gave him my license, but didn't see why I should give
my SS number ("I'll get it anyway," he said). Since I didn't have a
forest service pass, I got a ticket for a $30 dollar fine. I told him I didn't
think I should have to pay to hike on public land and that I believed that the
proliferation of user fees for low-impact activities has to stop. He merely
looked pained, and sent me on my way.


The drive home was the crux. I had to stop and sleep three times. A large
man leaned out of an espresso stand and bellowed angrily at me. I didn't stick
around to find out why. The day was cold and wet, but the mountain was good.
Thanks mountain!
