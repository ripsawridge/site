Helmut suggested to climb the [Stripsenzahn](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/stripsenzahn-totenkirchl/), a relatively short and easy
climb by the Stripsenjoch. We met at 7 am near Munich, a relatively late start, so we were hiking up with many people.
We had to endure 20 minutes of full on mid-morning sun, then fell gratefully into the shadow
of the Fleischbank, where we remained the rest of the day.

*Climbers on an interesting route to our right*

The route was a bit crowded. We gradually got to know Luisa and Jakob
ahead of us. She worked at a mountain hut nearby, and he lives in Innsbruck.
Really nice folks! Two guys appeared behind us as well, and were good
folks. It didn't make sense to hurry because there were one or two
parties ahead of Luisa and Jakob, too.

I got the first pitch, which was a lot of fun. A nice, steep wall with many
flakes and corners. Then some tough moves, traversing rightward on small,
sharp holds with sometimes poor footholds. A final traverse back left,
tough at the end, to reach the belay. I chatted with Jakob and brought
Helmut up.

Helmut led out on pitch 2, with interesting moves right at the belay
traversing left on a ramp. Pitch 3 wasn't really memorable, though Pitch
4 was nice and steep right off the belay with a face climb and underclings.

Pitch 5 was short but had the crux 6- move navigating an overhanging
corner, made easier with a hand jam. I got good pictures of Luisa climbing
this pitch because it begins off to the right and down a bit.

*A zoom-in of "Via Classica"*

As I led pitch 7, with interesting 5+ moves, there was a huge rockfall
and people shouting. It reminded me a bit too much of the accident in
2020. I had to just focus on the climbing and hope everyone would be
okay. After a few narrow chimney moves I reached Jakob at the belay.
We exchanged theories on what happened. In the end, it seems someone
knocked down a bunch of rocks into the big "Via Classica" slot, angering
the many people (5? 6?) inside, quite understandably.
But no one was hurt.

*Similar shot*

Luisa started climbing as I arrived. This last 55 meter pitch is only
rated 5, but perfectly sustained. The bolts are quite widely spaced, so
you've got to simply be confident and keep moving.

*Jakob follows the pitch*

Helmut came up and set off on the lead. He was able to place a couple of
nuts along the way, but enjoyed the pitch very much. I was able to
get a picture looking down in the first section. I quite enjoyed how
it got a bit easier, then rather difficult again for a bit. I got to do
some nice hand jams in the more broken-up blocks of the upper third.

*Remarkably steep*

The belay was off to the right outside of the chimney. The four of us
set off down together, first traversing very steep ground on a faint
trail in hummocks of grass, then climbing up to a cairn. Now we traversed
and descended slightly, making for an abseil station on one of the normal
routes of the Totenkirchl. We went a bit too far, and Helmut set off
heroically to abseil down a steep chimney, but another climber said it was
the wrong way. He came back up and we found Jakob and Luisa who had found
the correct abseil station.

Two abseils got us down to scrambling terrain, and soon we were going up
and down on the ridge to the Stripsenjochhaus. What was I ordering?
*Kaiserschmarrn!* I'd wanted to have that for months.
I liked our Hungarian waitress who told us to chill out and not be
so impatient.

*Hiking down*

A hike down to the car and back to Munich without *too* much traffic
despite the fact that school starts Tuesday.
