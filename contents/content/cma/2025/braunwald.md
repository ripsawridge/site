## Thursday

After sleeping in Mantra nearby, I decided to scramble up a peak I could
see from the parking lot called [Rautispitz](https://www.hikr.org/tour/post181034.html)
via a route called the Troosweg. I only got a few minutes of trail, then it
was scrambling up a gully on *latschen* game trails and scree slopes.
Then a long traverse to the base of the wall.

Here I started running into trouble. I'd found a GPS track and was following
it, failing to pay adequate attention to the route description for large
mountain features. I should have been far to the right, where the route goes
up a mixture of rock and heather benches. But the GPS track somehow led me
up rock climbing terrain. I soloed two pitches of grade III or III+, getting
nervous, and seeing no way that any route could possibly lead through the
vertical walls directly above. But I kept looking at the GPS and I was on
track. Then, on a ledge, I looked again, and the GPS track was way far off
to the right!

What?

I had to escape from my dead end, then traverse about 300 meters off to
the right. I wondered why the app had seemed to mislead me so much. It
must have something to do with zooming in too much and the app fails to
find an accurate position. Lesson learned: don't try to use a GPS for
micro-features, especially in steep terrain.

Anyway, I went over to the "right" place, but after the adventure thus far
I was feeling cautious. Supposedly the route had some old cables on it,
not very trustworthy but at least they show the line to follow. At the
base of a cliff I saw a bramble of wire cables. Maybe they were removed in
the years since these reports on hikr.org had been made? Anyway, it seemed
sketchy so I bailed, even though I think I was standing at the right place to
continue.

I decided to go straight down scree slopes to reach a little farm with a
trail leading to the west and the main trail. This was another hour of off-trail
travel. I connected to the main trail, then headed back to the car.

I guess I'll try again later. I drove to Linthal and took the train up to
Braunwald for the next days. A nice *raclette* dinner at the Adrenalin Hotel.

## Friday

I wanted to do the [Braunwalder Klettersteig](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/braunwald-klettersteig/) today. I was walking at 9, which is actually too
late in the heat. I resolved to skip breakfast the next two days so I could gain
elevation in the cool morning. Working my way up, I reached the Gumen
lift station, bought an Iced Tea drink, then walked up to the klettersteig
at the east ridge of the Eggstock summits. There were a few people on the
route, but not many despite the good weather. I started up, enjoying the
pleasant climbing. I'd decided to climb the easier route right on the ridge
because it seemed more scenic than the harder one, buried off in a corner
on the south side of the ridge.

On the Mittlerer Eggstock there was a neat bivouac building. After a brief
descent from the little parkland meadow on that summit, I finished the
route with the hardest climbing (via ferrata "grade 5") to the summit of the
Hinterer Eggstock. Really nice!

From this summit, the Ortstock off to the south is very impressive. I
borrowed some binoculars from some Italian guys, and tried to determine if
there were steps kicked into the snowfield which gains the northwest ridge
of that peak. I couldn't tell. It looked steep and snowy. But if I could
reach the *Furggele* Pass, then the last 300 meters to the summit along
the ridge looked to be clear.

I headed down and had some ice cream and a cigar at the Ortstockhütte,
a great place with nice staff. They said they like this time before
the high tourist season begins. I asked if they had any reports of a climb
of the Ortstock, and the nice woman there said that the snow had been a
problem for some people who tried. After having missed my summit Thursday,
I didn't want to head up there and possibly have to turn around because my
shoes weren't good enough. But as the day went on and I saw the different
ways the Ortstock dominates the Braunwald valley, I knew I had to try
and climb it.

A nice dinner at the Adrenalin hotel.

## Saturday

It was time to climb the [Ortstock](https://www.hikr.org/tour/post87633.html),
even with my worries of inadequate shoes! If I'm turned around, oh well.

It was great to start early. I thought about my walk through here on the
Via Alpina in 2017. What a peaceful and incredible journey. I will repeat it.

Steeply up along a waterfall to a place called Ober Stafel. then up through
cliffs to a place called Bärentritt. Here was a beautiful flat meadow and
a burbling stream, with the Ortstock above. Asking God for a bit of help,
chiefly, for good judgment on my part to prevent me from climbing up snow
slopes I shouldn't in inadequate shoes, I started up. Soon I was crossing snowfields,
but they were okay. The steepest parts were snowfield. Later, I avoided
snowfields for scree, making use of small dimples in the scree indicating
others had done the same. Before I knew it, I was at the final slope! It
remained suspenseful to the very end. The last difficulty was crossing
the steep snowfield a few meters beneath a cornice. I enlarged old tracks,
carefully dealing with a deep hole or moat by building good tracks around it,
then alighted on a rocky slope where a few more careful moves got me to
the summit of the pass.

Yes!

Now the way was clear to the summit, although steep. Soon I stood on top
admiring the views to Tödi and other mountains of the Klausenpass region.
On the way down, a woman was trying to get her big white fluffy dog to
climb a rock wall which had a chain for assistance. I got under the dog and
tried to lift him up but he was certain he didn't want to do it!

I left her conversing and pleading with her dog and continued down. She had
come to the pass from the south side, and I saw a whole line of people doing
that. I had been the only person coming from the north today.

I found a better way to avoid crossing the snowfield under the cornice, then had
to commit to stomping down the snowfield. This worked well, thanks to the
action of the sun. It was around 11 am. I could now usually choose snow and
didn't have to strictly avoid it.

Most of the way down I looked back to see 4 or 5 people coming down my way as
well. Later I meditated in the meadow but never saw these people passing by
though I heard their voices.

The valley was slowly filling with clouds. As I came back to town it started
to rain. I sat at a restaurant by an older lady who said her father had
been a hunter and mountain guide -- he'd climbed Tödi 200 times! She said
she'd been on the Ortstock 20 years before, but liked the mountains better
from the valley. Nearby, a table of older men sang beautiful alpine melodies.
I had pesto and beer, watching clouds appear and burn off around my mountain.

Later I had a cigar near the hotel under a shelter while thunder and lightning
flashed around me. What a wonderful day!

## Sunday

Todays plan was to climb [Grisset](https://www.hikr.org/tour/post70266.html).
Again, I started early. This time I had breakfast at the Gumen lift station,
then traversed over. At Ober Boden I started traveling a little north of
west over heather and boulderfields with slight descends on a generally
ascending line. Eventually snowfields made it easier, and I was standing
on the final moraine above an old glacier between Grisset and Bös Fulen.

I kicked steps up a steeper snowfield, then scrambled up to a ridge crest,
having to do some real (II+?) climbing moves to get there. From this point
I could follow scree slopes on a vague face, or keep climbing up heather and
rock. I chose the latter, though at times scree and rotten rock added
challenges. Soon enough I was on top enjoying the view.

Going down was harder. I opted for the scree, but gosh, it was unpleasant!
It really took me a while to make the many decisions about which way
to weave. Finally I was at the top of the rock climb, which I carefully
reversed. Getting down the snowfield was probably the most difficult part
of the day. I ended up kicking many steps and facing in to downclimb.
Occasionally I would traverse, but the snow was both slick and a bit too hard
underneath to feel like I could arrest if I slipped. Tired out, I reached
hiking terrain, then marched back towards the trails 2 kilometers away.
This time I took a different route because I wanted to visit a place called
Bützi, which I did and it was nice.

I went back to Gumen, ate some food, and took the lift down from there.
It was enough!

I thank God and the mountains for a good time. Barbara was with me in spirit
and we chatted often. This was a gift, too.
