Jaro, Camillo, Andreas and I skied up after work. A cold but beautiful evening with
a full moon. It was our first time up here. The ski route took us through a special
tunnel built just for ski touring folk! Pretty hilarious.

We got dinner on the way down at the Restaurant Kreuzalm in the ski area, which was
packed with the ski touring crowd. The way down was fast and icy, but nice.
