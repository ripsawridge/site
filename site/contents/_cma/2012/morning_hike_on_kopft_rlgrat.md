Georg and I were planning a weekend o' fun mountain climbing, but
the weather turned out to be rainy everywhere in the alps. We decided to
mop up a local standard climb, the Kopftörlgrat, the popular East Ridge
of the Ellmauer Halt, going from the Kopftörl ("head gate") to the summit
in a long UIAA grade III+ scramble.
  
  
We decided to take a rope, as Georg had done the climb a few years before,
and remembered a rather spicy downclimb of a slab, with sharp rocks faaar
below! Otherwise, we'd try to solo as much of the ridge as possible.
  
  
Leaving Munich at 5 am, we were apprehensive about the weather. Indeed,
you simply can't be caught by a storm up there. We would try to move very
fast, and have a hair-trigger approach to abandon the attempt before starting
on technical terrain if the clouds were coming in. Initial clouds over
Munich appeared ominous, but as we reached the south side of the Wilder
Kaiser, the sky was clear...woo hoo!
  
  
  
We hiked quickly up to the Grüttenhütte, and Georg led a crushing pace
beyond and all the way to the Kopftörl without stopping. I think I managed
to get him to stop once for a picture. We also had a hilarious escapade
in the forest after taking the wrong trail. We got tired of losing hard-won
elevation on a downhill trail, so we just bashed up through the brush to
the right where we knew we should eventually intersect the correct trail.
This worked fine. At an isolated place about 10 minutes off the trail on
either side we found a cute little birdhouse in what seemed to be a curious
private clearing in the forest. We joked that we'd stumble upon some cannibal
hillbillies playing highly commercial, cheesy Austrian folk music.

At the Kopftörl, with no sign of clouds, we switched to rock shoes
and kept moving. First traversing the south side beneath the crest, then
climbing a gully to reach the crest. We dropped to a notch then began real
rock climbing on the other side. Clean rock followed, occasionally alarmingly
polished, but mostly very nice. We continued up and down, at one point
taking two different variants on a rock face. I followed a chimney system
on the left, and Georg on the right. His variant had pitons, so it must
be the normal way. Then a spectacular "pitch" climbing on the crest with
big air on the north side, especially.
  
  
We pulled out the rope to descend a slab, then simul-climbed the rest
of the way to the summit. I think it took us about 2 hours on the ridge.
At the summit, many folks were there from the normal way. We hiked down,
making use of the occasional "via ferrata" equipment along the way.

Back at the hut, we were sopping wet from the hot and muggy weather. We
definitely needed drinks! Ordering a 1 liter "Maß" of Radler, I was soon
in heaven from the thirst-quenching drink. We drank and laughed for an
embarassingly long time. Finally we made the quick hike to the car and
the expected storm finally broke with violence, at least 2 hours later
than expected.
  
  
A slow drive home, as the cars had to be very careful in the heavy rain.
Thanks Georg!
