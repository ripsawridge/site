### Großer Riesenkopf
_June 13, 2021_

Nice quick hike up and down in the evening.

### Großer Riesenkopf
_May 30, 2021_

Up with a 9 kilogram pack, down somewhat lighter.

### Vogelsang and Seebergkopf
_May 23, 2021_

I hiked up the Vogelsang by the steepest way. Very fun! I descended, took a
short rest, then hiked up the Seebergkopf on the other side of the street.
Rather muddy over there.

I had some rain on the way down from the Vogelsang, but no big deal.

Wonderful morning

Gorgeous forest

### Sulzberg
_April 28, 2021_

Evening hike up Sulzberg, many paragliders there. Really fun run down.

### Wildbarren
_April 24, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up the steep way. We played a game as we approached the
summit: how many people would we find there? She guessed 4.
I guessed 12.

We arrived and counted 11. Right at that moment a single woman hiker
arrived, making it 12. And no one else came for many minutes. I won!

Barbara chose the way down: the steep way, then visit a trail that
traverses under cliffs to a road. We did this! Well, we took a wrong turn
and climbed about 100 meters accidentally. But then got back on track.
Great day, about 1200 meters up/down.

### Großer Riesenkopf
_April 23, 2021_

After work hike up this deceptively interesting peak. The summit, although it
appears to be a small bump barely sticking out of the forest, is quite
satisfying. Also, the very steep hike up past the Maiwand
is enjoyable. There is a section with ropes and a very serious drop off. Not for dogs or small children!
Also, it's easy to knock off some rocks in the final steep climb to the ridge crest there. I knocked
one rock off and was glad there was no one else on the trail.

I went down the normal way past the Petersberg.

### Wendelstein
_April 21, 2021_

A hike with snowshoes, starting from Bayrischzell, encountering snow about
halfway up, and using snowshoes to the summit. An avalanche knocked out
a short portion of the upper trail, but folks routed around it by kicking
steps up a slope for about 8 meters.

### Petersberg
_April 15, 2021_

A nice hike up after work. It snowed heavily for a while!

### Hochries
_April, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up Hochries for the first time. We discovered amazing [crags in the
forest](https://www.stadler-markus.de/klettern/lamprechtsfels.html), and even met the main pair of dudes who are setting routes on them. Later
we heard them drilling and setting new routes. Really cool.

We climbed up and down several grade II+/III- lines on this cliff:

Here we are at the top of Hochries in strong wind. We both got pretty tired by the
long low-angle trek across rocks on the summit ridge. Boah!

Here is Mara in that rocky stretch, happy like clam:

### Großer Rauher Kopf
_April 10, 2021_

Tired from the day before, I climbed an incredibly steep road near a place called the
Kastensteinerwand Alm. Then it became a steep trail, made more interesting by
wet, heavy snow and water just like the day before. Wearing these big mountain boots
and lugging snowshoes in my pack is a kind of hard life, especially so today because
everyone on the trail was wearing trail running shoes. I hate the way the soles of
my boots will slip so easily on wet roots -- trail runners are just way better about
that somehow. But anyway, I was the big slowpoke, and got used to finding a good place
off to the side of the trail to let the people pass going up and going down.

### Mittelstaufen
_April 9, 2021_

A hike in the late afternoon, snowshoes on my back. The forest was covered in wet, melting snow, making
deep pools of water held in place on the trail. The trail was called the "Bartlmahd." Shortly below
the summit, a young man ate soup and prepared to bed down for the night. After slogging through deep
snow, it was interesting that the final steep way to the summit was snowfree. Gorgeous sunset views
to the Chiemsee.

I was able to avoid using a headlamp all the way until the last few minutes of the trail.

### Kranzhorn
_April, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked to the summit, what a great day. We talked about love and
religion and everything in between.

### Hiking near Wendelstein
_March 28, 2021_

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up in snow from the parking lot to a summit. Really great.

### Bike ride to the southeast
_March 27, 2021_

[Here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/336107425) is the tour on komoot. 81 kilometers, about a 1000 meters up and down.
Really fun...very long and beautiful, too.

### Osterfelderkopf
_March 25, 2021_

Skied up from the Hausberg parking lot. First time to ski this year. Happily, my foot is okay
in the boot, if a little tight.

### Heuberg
_March 13, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up on a beautiful day.

### Wildbarren
_March 6, 2021_

With Jong on a snowy day.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

Night hike to the summit and back.

### Wildbarren

Wonderful day, up steeply and down the secondary way to the same trailhead.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

With Barbara and a small dog -- much fun!

### Wildbarren

Up steeply, but this time traversing around to the west and the dramatic sub-summit.
From there, the ridge is easily followed (game trail?) to join the trail to the summit near the small pretend-chapel.
Down the secondary steep way. Difficult, muddy time in the forest on steep, icy slope with ice under leaves.

### Heuberg

Night hike to the summit and back, thence to sleep in mountains.

### Heuberg
_February 6, 2021_

Barbara and I enjoyed a great spring-like day.
