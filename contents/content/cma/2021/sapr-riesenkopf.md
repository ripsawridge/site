### Großer Riesenkopf
_April 23, 2021_

After work hike up this deceptively interesting peak. The summit, although it
appears to be a small bump barely sticking out of the forest, is quite
satisfying. Also, the very steep hike up past the Maiwand
is enjoyable. There is a section with ropes and a very serious drop off. Not for dogs or small children!
Also, it's easy to knock off some rocks in the final steep climb to the ridge crest there. I knocked
one rock off and was glad there was no one else on the trail.

I went down the normal way past the Petersberg.
