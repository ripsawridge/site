<h3>Saturday</h3>


After an all night drive (from 12:30 am to 7:00 am), I staggered onto the small
train taking me from the parking lot at Taesch to Zermatt proper. Once in town I
found some breakfast and a sandwich for lunch, then immediately wimped out and
rode a sort of elevator train 600 meters up to Sunnegga at 2288 meters. With
such a short time for a long trip, I knew I'd make compromises to the idea of
walking every step of the way, and this was one of them. But hey...I'm on
vacation!


The view of the Matterhorn and the Breithorn from the top station was really
stunning. The former peak is so much taller and pointier in person than pictures
can describe. Rising immediately west of the town was the Ober Gabelhorn and
probably my favorite, the Zinalrothorn, all rising almost 10,000 feet above the
town. I was stunned by the number and size of the glaciers in every direction of
the compass. The sky was blue and clear, as if it had rained the day before and
washed the air.


Wow, okay now I'm hiking away to the north, with the Matterhorn at my back and
other snow giants on either side. First a gentle road contoured along the open
hillside, then I left the "blight" of the lift-served area (it was still a nice
place), and couldn't resist taking a trail that climbed to a pass above the
Taeschalp, from which the droning of cowbells made a comforting sound. Hiking
down I was again amazed by a new snow mountain, the Allalinhorn, visible behind
a battlement of glaciers at the head of the Taeschalp. I mentally traced lines
up the glacier, sure of the safest way, in that confident way being safe in the
valley produces!

"Where are all the people?" I thought. Part of mental preparation for a long
hike in a scenic climax zone of the alps was imagining wading through the hordes
people had told me about. But it was just like any trail in the U.S.! The odd
couple came along now and then, but I was alone for long stretches. This would
only increase as the trip went on - sometimes I'd be alone for many hours.


I was on a new trail called the Europaweg ("europe way"). It traverses a rocky
steep hillside for many miles, with great views looking down the valley and
across. The extra 1200 foot climb and descent combined with the all-night drive
had taken a lot out of me, though. At work Friday, we'd had an all day
"post-mortem" for our shipping product at a hotel. This was a good thing, though
such events are draining too. As I walked up and down the mountainside, I kept
thinking about software process models, code reviews, requirements documents and
the various other practices of our industry. I shook my head to focus on the
powerful Zinalrothorn and a major rock face on the east side. Suddenly the sky
was no longer blue, with clouds coming in from the north.


I was pleased to walk high above the huge indoor parking lot where my car would
wait for a week. Looking down on the town of Randa, I was amazed by the huge
landslide that had crashed down 15 years before. A bulldozer scraped
ineffectually at a lower corner of it. The explosion must have been
earth-shattering, and the resulting floods because of the blocked river
terrible.

By 2:30 pm, I'd reached the Europa Hut. Tired as I was, it seemed a welcome
place for the night. I ordered some lunch of eggs and potatoes, then went to
sleep in an upper bunk. Rising for dinner, I conversed with a really nice Swiss
guy named Henri. He had several spine-chilling stories of climbs on the
Matterhorn gone wrong. In one case, a guide was standing in the door of a
bivouac hut, in relative safety. His client slipped, falling off the mountain
and whisking the guide out of the hut to his death. It sounds like the sheer
number of applicants, at all skill levels becomes a real danger, especially
combined with a change in the weather.


But this wouldn't be a climbing trip for me. How many years had it been since I
just went for a hike? No ambitions to climb peak X or Y at the back of some dark
valley. It was something I'd wanted to do for a few years, feeling a need to get
back in touch with the first experiences I'd had in the hills. I had taken to
heart something <a href="http://www.kevreynolds.co.uk/">Kev Reynolds</a> 
said in his excellent book 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Alps-Travel-Kev-Reynolds/dp/1566563437">Walking
in the Alps</a>:


<i>
"...from the point of view of the walker who is, after all, in the most favoured
position to witness and enjoy mountain scenery in all its abundant variety.
The motorist is divorced from all that is best in the Alps by being restricted to
the highway. The non-active tourist is confined to mechanised means of uplift, the
climber's attention is for the most part taken up with the intracacies of his chosen
route, while the downhill skier needs full concentration in the rush to get to the foot
of the slope without accident. Only the mountain walker, the individual with good
general fitness, a modicum of scrambling experience and an eye for the hills, can
move far enough and at the right pace to enjoy the full range of wonders that the Alps
so generously offer."
</i>


(Humorously, I didn't have Kev's travel companion to this hike, 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chamonix-Zermatt-Walkers-Cicerone-Guide/dp/1852843276/sr=1-1/qid=1159298678/ref=sr_1_1/102-2988812-4044948?ie=UTF8&s=books">Chamonix to Zermatt: A Walker's Haute Route</a>. By the time I decided to make this hike,
there was no time to order the english language guidebook from Amazon, and I
couldn't find it in Munich. So instead I had to cringe and tear pages out of
Walking in the Alps. Along the way, a fellow gave me xeroxed copies of 3 pages
from the book, about the Turtmanntal valley. I read and re-read those pages that
day!)

<h3>Sunday</h3>


In the night it rained, and I moped at breakfast, wondering if I should abandon
the trip...the car was still nearby. But stepping out revealed mostly blue sky,
with mysterious wreaths of cloud around the high peaks. "Hey, this is alright" I
thought, brightening considerably. Henri joined me, and we hiked together for
some fun hours. I enjoyed this portion of the trail much more. There was less up
and down, we saw some wildlife, and there were exciting edge-of-cliff sections
with a little hand-railing should you need it. Henri was hoping to travel north
then back south over the ridge to Sass-Fee. We reached a dramatic lookout point
back to a mountain called the Ulrichhorn with another massive glacier. There was
a cute statue of St. Bernard - the patron saint of the Alps! He and his
contingent of monks saved many travellers from bandits and avalanches in the
first century A.D., at the nearby pass that bears his name. I was mentally
adding up how many days I had and how far I had to get, gradually coming to
think I needed to cover a lot more ground today. Traditionally, I would stop at
the town of St. Niklaus below, however I wanted to make it over the distant
Augstbordpass to Gruben. I just can't seem to resist a certain
goal-orientation. A passerby had said the trail was especially beautiful to the
west of Arolla, and at my current pace it would be tough to even make it
there. Yet wheels were turning!

Okay, first off I needed to drop the bivy gear. I was carrying a sleeping bag, a
bivy sack and a ground pad. It was slowing me down some, and I realized I didn't
want to use the gear in this weather. If it did rain hard, my sleeping bag would
likely get wet, then I'd be tired for a day. If it rained the next night, I'd
really be cold. So after saying goodbye to Henri, I hurried 4000 feet down to
St. Niklaus, hoping to find a locker in the train station to stash my
gear. Barring that, I'd have to hide it in the woods. You really think hard
about how to hide 500 dollars worth of gear in one of the most popular hiking
areas of the world!


Near the town I went through a charming old mini-village of ancient swiss
houses. They seemed empty, but vaguely lived in. I liked how narrow the alley
between the houses was. I got irritated by a strange trail re-routing that made
me re-climb 300 feet only to come out on a logging road a half-mile back towards
Zermatt. Wierd things often happen to trails near towns. A patchwork of property
and logging roads interrupts or truncates the trail. Once lost, you just bash
down unsigned way trails, roads or game paths. Yeesh!


In the strangely deserted town, I filled my water bottle from the village
fountain. At the train station I found no lockers. Okay, I'd have to hide my
gear. Wallking back downhill and across the river, I was shadowed by a heavyset
young man wearing a "Danzig" t-shirt. Hoping he wasn't watching, I turned back
up the trail and looked for a suitable site. It's hard to find a place not
visible from above or below in this region of steep switchbacks. Finally,
scarily close to a house, I saw a faint deer path, and followed it to a fallen
log. Perfect! I could shove things under the log and build a wall of rocks to
prevent the brightly colored high-tech fabric from being seen. I hoped that no
curious forest creatures would rip my shelter apart, and climbed out, looking
for the lurking young fellow.

At the train station I'd picked up a brochure that mentioned a ski lift I could
take up to the town of Jungu 2700 feet above. I could really use the boost if I
wanted to reach Gruben tonight. I stared dumbly at the paper. There was a lift
at 1 pm, and another at 3:30 pm. I'd hate to wait until so late. What time is it
now? 12:53? Oh!


I had to run downhill, then across town steeply uphill, really huffing and
puffing. "Oh man I hope I make it!" I made it to the lift, simultaneously with 4
other people who came out of the woodwork of the deserted town. "Yes!"


Jungu was really cute. I imagined coming here for a family vacation with Kris
and the boys. I hiked towards the beautiful Jungtal, relunctantly turning away
when my trail veered north and up into the Augstbord valley. A large
"steinmandl" (stone man, or pile of rocks) marked the entry to the valley, where
some hikers were enjoying the view. I continued on, gradually climbing to the
Augstbordpass where the freezing wind was screaming in from the west. I
descended into a broad valley that became really pleasant once the wind weakened
and the sun came out. Walking beside a babbling stream, I longed to take off my
boots and laze, but worries about finding a room at the inn in Gruben kept me
walking. Two women told me the hotel was called the Schwarzwald Hotel, and I
resolved to remember the name as I prowled the streets. Once down I had to
laugh: the town was a collection of about 20 small houses, a white church and
the relatively large Schwarzwald hotel. I got a dorm room completely to myself,
and enjoyed a really good dinner. It was kind of lonely though. There was a
rollicking guided party of about 14 people at a large table, and a reserved
Canadian couple. I ended up eating alone, looking at my map and planning my
days. It's easier for me to feel lonely and awkward in a crowd. Whereas when
truly alone, I'm comfortable and generally happy. Go figure.


I was pleased to have reached Gruben. Tomorrow night, I'll be in Zinal, the
first of the French-speaking valleys.

<h3>Monday</h3>


Clouds mostly obscured the big peaks today, though I got sullen glimpses of the
Bishorn at the head of the Turtmantal valley. This valley, and Gruben itself,
was interesting. It's only inhabited in the summer, and retreats to pristine
quiet in the wintertime. A guidebook said this was like the old Switzerland of
the Golden Age of alpine climbing more than 100 years ago. It was a very
appealing place.


As for the trail, first it was a road, climbing gently for a mile, then more
steeply on a thin trail through light forest. In here I found a large boulder
with a little shrine to the Virgin Mary embedded in the middle. A porcelin
figurine of Mary shared a 6 by 3 inch ledge with a crudely carved figure -
perhaps a more ancient pagan symbol? You always seem to stumble across little
secrets like these in the alps. Like the "route books" found in inaccessible
caves along long rock climbing routes. I made a little video of the shrine while
humming the opening to "The Firebird Suite."


Higher, I lost the trail on a steep hillside, but continued gamely up, knowing
up was the only valid direction. Two farmers were up early high above, mending a
fence. I kept out of sight around a corner, moving up and stepping over the
occasional fence across steep cow pastures. Nowadays, the fences are just thin
strips of tape or wire. Sometimes, they are electrified, and you can see the car
battery sitting nearby for the charge. I think they get the cows used to the
idea that all the fences are electrified, but at any given moment, only 3-5% of
them actually are.


I passed a large farm building (Chalte Berg) with a generator, and admired the
broad scenic valley. I was really getting an eyeload of big, pastoral valleys
underneath the great peaks. It's a terrain very different from the Washington
Cascades. Maybe Colorado is like this? Despite the somber morning clouds, it
gave a real sense of freedom.


 I climbed gradually up into a hanging valley called the Blueomatt. Beyond the
 two farmers, I saw no one else until descending into Zinal hours later. Perhaps
 the isolation made it easier for me to lose my glasses!


I'd gotten used to wearing them for a few hours, then changing into contact
lenses on the trail. I left my glasses on a rock somewhere in this large
pastoral valley. Perhaps a goat tried crunching them for taste!

At the pass called Forcletta (2874 meters), I was walking in light snow, and
admiring little flurries driven by the wind. Another stunning walk down a
pastoral valley, and I was admiring dark cliffs above Zinal. The mountain called
the Garde de Bordon looked especially menacing with fresh snow on it's
ledges. As I descended to the valley, the snow turned to light rain. Steep
switchbacks brought me into town, where I quickly found a hotel room. Wow -
Zinal was the big city, it had a supermarket, sports store, tourist office and
several restaurants! It was 2:00 and everything was closed until 2:30. When
things opened, I went into a newsstand and bought a paper and a paperback book,
which I would spend the afternoon reading ("A Year in the Merde"...it was
okay). I had a great meaty, greasy pizza for lunch, and a very "french" meal for
dinner. It involved duck and some strange pimento-loaf-like meat with a hidden
bone in it. Shudder.


It was neat to have my own room. I bought some shampoo so I could take a real
shower. Who hoo!
