<h3>Joshua Tree Climbing, December 23, 2003</h3>

Kris and I climbed for about a 1/2 day here on these formations:<br><br>

<b>Trashcan Rock</b> - "B-2" (5.3): Pretty nice crack climb, which Kris followed. "Tiptoe" (5.7): bolted slab climbing.
"Karpkwitz" (5.6): thin crack over a bulge.<br>

<b>Atlantis Wall</b> - "Men with Cow's Heads" (5.5): pretty steep crack climb for a 5.5. "Wet Pigeon" (5.8): Only on top-rope,
the boulder problem start made me pause.<br>

<b>Hemingway Buttress</b> - "White Lightning" (5.7): A really great hand crack with off-width start. I had some difficulty
cleaning the route, because Kris couldn't lower me all the way. So I fixed the line at the top, rappelled, cleaning gear.
Then I reclimbed the route using a prusik self-belay. Then I coiled the rope to go find a rap station that would let
me descend from the buttress with a single rope rappel. By the time I was down, it felt like I'd done three climbs.
It actually started to rain, so we left.<br>


Kris and I spent the late afternoon hiking to an "oasis" in a bowl between mountains. It was about 3 miles round trip.
On the way back, I went cross-country across some ridges and basins, eventually meeting up with Kris at a high pass with
views of the town of 29 Palms. Their lights were coming on and it looked purdy.
