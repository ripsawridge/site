<h2>Southwest Gully</h2>
<h3>June 19, 2004</h3>


<p>
<font size=+3>It was time </font> to climb Merchant Peak. While I grilled a steak Friday night, our cat
Quincy zoomed out of the house and into the dark woods with a shriek. We didn't
sleep well, knowing his personality too well. An indoor cat, he'd never been
outside, and he was prone to panic attacks that caused him to hide under a bed
for days. Would he find his way home?
</p>
<p>
In the morning I walked the neighborhood mournfully, half expecting to see his
soft orange body on the side of the road. House chores were impossible. I had
to get away for a while.
</p>
<p>
Where's my crampons? Crap, maybe they are at Theron's house. I didn't want any bout
of hard snow to turn me around, so I wore my big clunky boots and took the heavy
steel crampons. What a mistake I would often rue on hot dusty slopes! But that's later.
</p>
<p>
Two hours later, I'm clomping up a boulderfield in the woods, wondering how
such a mature forest could be covered in 4 feet of rocks. There must have been
a really dark and stormy night long ago. Sweat is dripping off of me like I'm
doing sit ups in a clothes dryer. Note to self - 1 pm starts on south facing low
elevation hillsides are inferior. My food was a package of salami, turning from a
healthy red to gray in a matter of minutes. Icch.
</p>
<p>
I passed a waterfall on the left, then another one on the right. This one gave
me pause, because I had to do some tricky slab climbing that I thought would
be hard coming down. Again I cursed my boots. Blocks of snow dripped in the
gully, creating platforms suspended high above the stream and deep caves, daring
you to walk on them. Was this the kind of hell Quincy was experiencing?
</p>
<p>
Above the waterfall, the gully became steeper, eventually pushing me upslope on
the left to crumbling dirt. A metric ton of material was displaced into the 
water thanks to my steps and the smell of cordite filled the air. I was kind
of embarassed about the noise, I hoped no cats were trying to get home across
the gully. My beta printout said to look for a cave on the right, and find
a trail into the cave. Once in the cave, the route gained a degree of remoteness.
Can I find my way back from here? Some bushy dirt slopes led up to the right.
Mt. Baring kept a watch on me, and the blue sky clouded up. I emerged from
a fight with an alder tree on high rock above a waterfall. Time for some
gray-green salami! Icch.
</p>
<p>
Now I was confused, I should have brought a map, because there was a summit on
the right and one on the left. The left looked pointier. I climbed polished
slabs between two streams and with a sense of deja vu, made yet another traverse
from brush onto high rock above a waterfall. I left a cairn here, sure that
most cats would find all this too hard to reverse. Another stomp in a loose
gully brought significant change: I had reached the broad heather fields
of the south face, peopled with outcrops of solid rock. A cool breeze
evaporated my protective sheen of sweat. I decided on the left summit, and
worked up the steep heather vaguely in that direction. Sometimes I climbed on
rock, making moves I worried about reversing, sometimes I grasped heather
with both hands and pulled over a mossy seep. Usually I walked steeply uphill.
The wind increased and I heard a plane that I thought was thunder. Then I
heard real thunder, and noticed it wasn't so sunny anymore.
</p>
<p>
Scootling to the ridgecrest, I had my first views of mountains to the north.
Continuing up a snowfield, I was briefly pleased with heavy boots, but still
much the worse with bitterness. I finally used my ice axe 100 feet below the
summit. I admired a huge snow cornice overhanging the north side, pleased that
my tracks had unwittingly stayed well back of it, for it was dripping
copiously. How could I set it off? Losing interest, I scrambled fine rock 
to the summit which had a cairn, a register, and pastoral views of sheets of
rain to the west and south. There was lightning over Mt. Daniels, and 
Rainier was hidden by black cloud. The normal route to Gunn Peak was free of
snow, a great contrast from two years before when Peter and I used it for
our climb. Del Campo, Whitehorse, Sloan and Glacier Peak loomed to the north.
I tried to imagine where Theron and Robert were on their traverse above
Monte Cristo. Townsend Mountain looked attractive: high, broad and gentle,
while the cliffs of Mt. Baring threw out a challenge, rising from a complex mulch
of steep brush, cliffs and trees.
</p>

10 minutes was enough today, I headed down at 4:30, soon experiencing the
real tedium of a snow-free Merchant Peak climb. Walking down steep
slopes for almost 4000 feet is a real "knee workout." I found better ways
around obstacles on the heather slopes, then lowered myself down streambeds
of rotten rock, turning right at waterfalls. The slopes above the cave
set a real standard for the absolute steepest angle you can "walk" on.
I had to place both hiking poles below me, lower myself enough to create
an edge with a boot sole, balance carefully while repositioning my poles
and repeat. Dirt and rock clattering down the hill all the while. Fat 
raindrops appeared as I muddled through the cave, and the rock grew
wet as I clattered down to a nervous appointment with the upper waterfall.
I was able to stay in brush for most of it, but finally had to contemplate
downclimbing the insecure slabs I'd come up. Not trusting my boots on the
wet rock, I delayed the inevitable by noticing something man-made.
Crabbing over to it, I discovered a rappel sling around a boulder. "Great,"
I thought. "Wish I could rappel." Careful moves got me down foot by foot.
Eventually I sat on my butt, using my hands to find edges under the moss.
I realized I might slide, but would probably escape with minor cuts and
bruises. Once I lost control, but somehow steered right to a lower angle
bench. For the last ten feet, I slid unhappily, then got up cursing.
At least I was done with the difficulties!
</p>
<p>
I took off shoes and drank water above the lower waterfall, happy for a
break after the tense work above. Would my cat be at home?
</p>
<p>
Below the first waterfall I was flummoxed. I hadn't noticed that two identical
rocky gullies joined at it's base. Which one did I come up? A poor guesser,
I chose the right one. Continuing smugly down for a few hundred feet, I
realized I'd err'd when my road choked off in Devil's Club and slide alder.
Climb back up? No way! I bashed into the jungle on the left, aiming down
and left where I'd either find my gully or thrash all the way down to 
Barclay Creek. Not my brightest idea.
</p>
<p>
The many vines and thorns tried to tear me limb from limb, refusing to let
go of a handy leg or ice axe poking above a pack. After an ocean of damp
green spirits I reached big timber which is thankfully free of thorns.
It was fun walking where no one had ever walked, or at least I thought
that until I saw a pile of rocks that looked suspiciously man-made.
Two rocks, one on top of the other, but arranged kind of artfully. Now
three rocks we know nature doesn't do. Eventually I reached the proper
rockslide and followed it down to the trail. A long flat mile 
saw me out to the car. 
</p>
<p>
Quincy began meowing outside around midnight. Our looks with a headlamp
scared him away. By 2 am, he gave up and meowed over and over, coming to
the screen door and pawing at it desperately, somehow missing the fact
that it was open enough for him to slink in. Kris opened it all the way,
and he rushed in and down to his hiding place underneath the bed. Praise be!
