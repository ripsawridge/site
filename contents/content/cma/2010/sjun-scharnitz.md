### Scharnitz Climbing
<b>June 6, 2010</b>

Coming home from camping and hiking with Kris and the boys we stopped at the Scharnitz town climbing wall. The family was so tired, so they slept in the car and I went up to check out the climbing alone. At the <i>Neuer Klettergarten</i> wall, I rope soloed the route <b>"Kurze (IV-)"</b>
 twice, then soloed it once. Then I rope soloed <b>"Linke Platte (V)",</b>
, and then top-rope soloed <b>"Riss (V+)"</b>
. Those two were great! Then a nice couple from Munich let me hop on their rope for a top rope of <b>"Platte (VI+)"</b>
, which had an exciting move in the lower 3rd.

Fun, short climbs. Great place for the family, alas, they were too sleepy!
