*Update*: Uli added his own thoughts on the climb below, too.

Only a day after Vaclav and I climbed the Riegelekante I was back in the
Wilder Kaiser, this time on the northwest side of the range, instead of the
southeast!

For Uli and I had business on the Scheffauer with "[Nordwandliebe](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/nordwandliebe-scheffauer/)" (North Wall Love
is the translation), created by the amazing local climbing couple
Herbert und Inez Haselsberger. Years ago, Uli and I ran into Herbert
on [a late fall climb](/cma/2009/viaromantica.html) of "Via Romantica (VI+)," probably his most famous
addition to the walls of his home mountains in the western part of the
Wilder Kaiser.

Christiane came along, and made a long visit to the whole of the Kaiserbach valley.
We'd meet her again after the climb at the Kaindlhütte. Since I was so
tired and sore from the day before I made sure we took the little chairlift
to the Brentenjochalm, saving about 700 meters of elevation gain. It was
strangely enjoyable sitting in the single-person chairlift, looking into
sun-dappled woods all around. 

Uli and I walked quickly enough to the base of the Scheffauer north face,
then walked along it about 10 minutes to the left where we easily found the
route (marked by a little red heart on the rock). The sky was blue and the day
would be fine, but on starting up, we were cold. Uli got the first pitch, at 5-
one of the harder ones. He had to think a little while at the 2nd bolt to really
commit to the moves. Following the pitch I was impressed -- it felt difficult for
cold fingers.

## Uli's Impressions

> It was a long time since my last climb, I guess I've paused almost two years.
The moment when Michael passed me the sharp end of the rope at the bottom of
the Scheffauer northface was: Puh, I am still capable to lead the 5- pitch?
Often I had these moments of overwhelm on climbing trips which put me in a
state of constant pressure, which accompanied me through the entire route. So
this moment was somehow anticipated and well known, but not really welcome.

> I took the rope and started climbing. It turned out that the moves are not that
hard, but committing. Away from the slightly overhanging ridge onto the slabby
face with little holds. After a few attempts, my fingers were already numb, I
started off. At the belay I felt cold, but good that I've accomplished the
first difficult parts of the climb.

> The second pitch was led by Michael. I followed via the traverse below an
overhanging band and then around the corner and steep up to the belay. That
corner was my personal crux. I felt very insecure in this move, knew what to
do, but couldn't find my courage to move. So I searched for good handholds,
pulled my self up, found something to step on. Now I had to reach further with
my hand, but didn't dare. Got tired in this arkward inbetween position and this
voice inside me said, let Michael pull the rope and take a rest. Firmly I said
NO to myself and pulled through, accepting the risk of a short fall. My fingers
finally found the next hold, one footstep up and I was around that "diabolish"
corner.

> With that early moment in the climb I'd won the whole day. The rest of the
climb I felt good, no overwhelm about lurking hard moves in the upper pitches. I
was climbing with respect and caution, but I felt capable and not stressed like
often before. So for me it became a really new and nice experience.

Here is Uli on pitch two, just after those hard moves he described!


As Uli says so well, pitch two (IV+) *was* interesting! A rather intimidating rightward
traverse with lots of exposure led to a slab which is climbed directly up, then back
left to the belay station. Wow! It was a high quality pitch, but Uli and I both felt
that we might be off the wall rather late indeed. In fact, the next pitch, at grade
III+ and 50 meters shouldn't be difficult on the face of it, but it began with
vertical lieback moves on slabby terrain. I wouldn't call that grade III+!
However, as the day gradually warmed up our fingers felt happier and we got used
to the rock. After these intimidating first three pitches, we found that the grading
of the route was very good / correct.

We continued up, especially enjoying pitch 7 (IV+), which climbed clean rock to the
top of a pillar with a little bit of sun. A bit of downclimbing, then travelling in
coils for a pitch connected us from this pillar to the steeper face of the upper
route. Pitches 10 (IV) and 11 (V-) were especially good. First, steep climbing on
somewhat breakable rock, then cruxy moves on an leftward rising traverse which was
very well protected (3 bolts and a fixed pin). Pitch 11 ended with fantastic slabby
moves above the traverse.

The last three pitches (III+, III, III) were quick and enjoyable. Indeed, the quality of
the grade III pitches was always high. We put the rope away and scrambled up to the
last difficulty: the "Schaffler Sprung (III-)." We lowered ourselves on a fixed rope
then stepped across a large gap somewhat apprehensively. Whew!

We had a fantastic meal on top: cheese, sausage, peppers, bread, chocolate. We made the
rapid but steep descent on the Widauersteig -- Uli was so fast! I was racing to keep
up, but at some point in the years I became a slow descender. Strange how that sneaks
up on you...!

I got to the Kaindlhütte to find Christiane and Uli sharing a beer. I ordered a Radler
and a piece of Topfenkuchen to get some sugar in me for the long descent to Kufstein.
We talked and joked (and Christiane even shamed me into 30 minutes of Deutsch) all the
way down trails and roads to the car, getting there at about 21:30. 

Long, fantastic
day, thanks Uli, Christiane, thanks Scheffauer and the mysterious loving-rocks of
a shady north wall!
