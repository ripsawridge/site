It was time to clean the 1971 Hermes Baby, and proceed with my plans
to put an inner tube over the platen in order to improve grip.
Elijah and I tried removing the platen, and failed because we unscrewed
the right platen knob, and after removing the screws on the left
nothing moved.

Finally I stumbled upon a message in the Facebook Antique Typewriter
Collectors group, where someone explained that the left knob must be
turned to the *right* in order to loosen it. Oh my gosh! That worked!

So, on the third attempt to remove the platen I finally did it.

I took a picture of the parts, but failed to pay attention to the
direction of the teeth on the platen ratchet.

The platen removed


I proceeded immediately to get the bike inner tube onto the platen.
This was hilarious...so exhausting, so difficult! Somehow, there were
tricks. I used an x-acto knife to trim the edges. Then I tried to put
it back into the machine. No go! The Hermes Baby is a very tight machine,
and in retrospect it was probably silly to expect that the extra millimeter
or three would fit in. So, I applied some sandpaper to the platen, then
put brake fluid on it. The next morning, a little more sandpaper and I
hoped that would do the job.

Ill-fated attempt

Now though, I'd noticed the inside of the machine - what a mess!
The ribbon was a correcting ribbon with flaky, silvery tape. This was everywhere
in the machine! Off to the hardwear store for brushes, Mineral Spirits
("Terpentinersatz" in Germany), cotton cloths and cans of compressed air.
An old toothbrush rounded out the mix, and soon I was blasting music
and cleaning the type segment. Great fun, really.

Terrible ribbon

I was supposed to meet my girlfriend for a movie, and thought I could get the
platen back on easily. Wow, here my problems began.

First off, a small metal tine on the carriage release lever had come loose, which
meant poor tension in the lever. This took a lot of staring and licking of lips
to figure out.

Metal tine on carriage release

Then the carriage release had bent a little bit, and was interfering with the
paper holder...knocking it up at times. I had to gently bend it back.

Finally, the platen ratchet knob just wouldn't go on in the right place. I was so
perplexed...taking it apart again and again. You'll know you are doing it wrong
if you are unable to get the screws on the left platen knob, because this knob has
to thread inside the platen case, and interface with the inner hole of the ratchet.
Since I didn't understand this, I kept putting things together and experiencing
uneven platen ratcheting. Of course you need machine-gun ratchet precision!


The answer, for me, was to put the typewriter on it's side, and stare down the barrel
of the left platen face...make sure the ratchet was in the right spot, and screw on the
left knob, being sensitive to the moment when it should interface with the ratchet
hole. Getting this right means the platen ratchet is in the right place.

The left platen knob

One last problem however (by now the movie with my girlfriend is over, it was great,
I was late though...and a snowy hike and a day of work also occurred): the line-spacer
was sometimes unable to move the carriage forward. It would move it two ratchets, sometimes
one, and sometimes not at all. I discovered it was because the ratchet *teeth were facing
the wrong way.* The sharp side of the teeth should face the person at the typewriter.
Then the line-spacer teeth grip better.

Oh man. Okay, now time to put it back in the case. I'd cleaned the case thoroughly, it
was hella gross!

But getting it in was scary...plastic was bending all over the place...I was using gravity
to assist me, pushing things this way and that with my belly, with a screwdriver held in
my mouth, so insane! Finally I got it in. I think this is rather terrible though.
I hope the metal case around my 1954 Hermes Baby is easier to deal with, man.

My tools so far...

I must say, this was a very enjoyable experience. My first visit into the case didn't
teach me everything, but I like what I saw there. Typewriters make sense.

Ciao!
