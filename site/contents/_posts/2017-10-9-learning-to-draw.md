## Drawing with pencils
Lately I've been learning to draw, thanks to great YouTube tutorials like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i4pFcLVAk">this one</a>, from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm2WMojIj6033QI3VzhFjLg">HowToDraw</a>. Lots of fun!

Of course, Elijah has been annotating my efforts with little red Pennywise balloons, which
creeps me the heck out.
