_He's a teacher..._
  
  
Today, as a typical liberal, I went through the usual cycle of outrage,
this time from [Joan Walsh's](http://www.salon.com/2012/03/02/hold_this_between_your_knees_rush_limbaugh/) article
about the recent contraception hearings, a womans attempt to testify, and
Rush Limbaugh's response. From the article:
  
  
  

>   
> Limbaugh called her a "slut" and a "prostitute," and promised to buy Fluke
> and Georgetown women "as much aspirin to put between their knees as they
> want. We are paying her for having sex. We are getting screwed. So Ms.
> Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal: If we are going to
> pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want
> something for it, and I'll tell you what it is: We want you to post the
> videos online, so we can all watch."

I found it offensive. I went to "America's Wall," (ie, Facebook) and wrote
that he oughta be slapped and punched. My offense was personal, because
I felt like he was speaking to all women with that kind of language, and
that includes mothers.
  
  
You don't talk that way about ANYBODY's mother, was my feeling.
  
  
Now we can argue whether my reaction to his words is illegitimate. But
the ugliness with which he delivered those words, and the appalling filthy
suggestion he makes is just plain shocking.
  
  
I know I'm playing a role. I know that a big part of the thrill of this
kind of talk is that it creates outrage. The next step in the game is for
an apology to come forth. From here on out the game is played in our living
rooms, on our Facebook walls, our blogs, our Thanksgiving dinners and coffee
machines at work. The apology is trotted out as evidence that it was all
a big joke, and a wide-eyed innocence is proclaimed. At this point, whoever
took umbrage with the words looks the fool. Blathering on as he or she
did, plainly angry. Cool people are never angry. The endgame is that the
national profile of Rush Limbaugh is increased, his fans feel an insider's
sense of superiority in laughing at the appointed targets, and they share
a smugness at the reaction provoked. The unfortunate individual who complained
has been robbed of the basis of his or her anger, since it was all a joke.
Doubly victimized, this person wanders away, having lost some faith in
humanity. The worldview of the insiders is confirmed...they are the only
ones above the fray, living among fools.
  
  
This is what is being sold. And it's tremendously successful. During the
last 20 years, Rush Limbaugh has become the real power behind the Republican
Party. When a politician on the right offends him by going against his
ideas, there is a quick backtrack and public apology. Make no mistake,
he is powerful. He uses humor as a sword. It's a nasty humor, and if you
hear enough of it you can't help but think of his victims as insects that
need to be stamped out. This way of talking about enemies is chilling,
and was used in every genocidal regime we know of. I think that a reasonable
person wouldn't want to go within 20 feet of talking that way. But he does
it all the time...after all it's only to be funny, right?
  
  
What really upsets me though, is not so much that he's become a millionaire
by talking this way in national media, but that his story and methods have
gone viral, and as local as your friends and neighbors.
  
  
It's all about eyeballs in our world. Engage in certain controversial
opinions and your profile is raised. Rock-n-roll happened 40 years ago,
and was quickly co-opted by the corporate world. Now, our heros are "rebels,"
or cast that way, and we can't help but admire a maverick. So when we search
to stand out, an easy way forward is to cast ourselves against the status
quo.
  
  
Long ago, the status quo in our country was very conservative. The rebels
were inclusive, anti-corporate, and questioned the basic whys of everything
they were handed. At the same time, the political world had respectable
positions and elements that would be a liberal fantasy-world today: strong
unions, and an intact sense that we are in this together. Now, "greed is
good" has mostly stamped that out, unless you are certified as a church
member in good standing. See, citizens aren't supposed to care about each
other, only church members. But that's another story.
  
  
It clicked home for me when a friend referred to Andrew Breitbart as a
"punk rock Republican." You see, I thought of him as a corporate shill.
His opinions may appear acerbic and surprising, but at the end of the day
they always support corporate-friendly options. He had a way of arguing
that elimination of the union your dad is a member of was a blow for freedom
against a bunch of unimaginative beauracrats. He could blow up a politicians
career with salacious and witty commentary. No one would notice that the
politician listened more to the powerless than the powerful. Meanwhile,
a miasma of cynicism would spread, and conspiracy theories grow. Guys like
this don't do us any favors.
  
  
But if he's a "punk rock Republican," that explains some of the appeal.
It implies a tough "take no prisoners" attitude, probably fierce honesty
and authenticity as well. It creates a psychological distance from stuffy,
fat old Republicans who are the kiss of death if you still want to get
the girls.
  
  
All of this is off the top of my head, I'm just going on the feelings
I get from the term punk rock. If your mental picture is wildly different
just tell me. There must be considerable variation here.
  
  
These "punk rockers" wield their sound bites as weapons, pumping up their
stock as their targets wilt. They rise from obscurity to national profile
by combining considerable talent with this gimmick. Their fans can play
the game on a local level. Got a local egghead or "feminazi" you want to
see piss his or her pants? Just repeat one of those opinions and watch
them explode. Yuks all 'round!
  
  
Now it's true that the eggheads need to learn this game, and quit being
played for a fool. But what amazes me is that the people pulling these
pranks manage to see themselves as "punk rockers," and not the voice of
authority at play that they really are. Bullies are where they are because
they are aligned with the powerful, and they pick on the powerless. I don't
know much about punk rock, but their political opinions must have been
about as far from frat boy politics as you can get. To co-opt their stance
is just another typical stunt, like Glenn Beck co-opting Martin Luther
King day. I think Adolf Hitler said somthing to the effect that the people
won't believe a little lie, but they'll believe a big one. I'm seeing that
dynamic at play here.
  
  
Back to teaching. What is politics? Is it power flowing from the end of
a gun? Is it the struggle between good ideas and bad ones? Is it (even
worse), who looks foolish and who looks strong? In our modern world, it
seems to be the latter. Hateful ideas get a big boost in the market with
this dynamic. Witness our "war on drugs." No politican wants to be accused
of weakness. So drug policy that would actually help languishes, and lock-ups
prevail. It appears that fear of foolishness is a strong currency.
  
  
As I came to political maturity, I identified as a liberal. At the same
time, I learned that this had become a dirty word. It became that way through
mockery, snide comments, subtle innuendo and dog whistle code words. Now
the world is very different. Even as American's \*are\* generally liberal
in their viewpoints, they must apologize for that. They are "naive fools."
  
  
Rush Limbaugh teaches his fans how to keep the libruls in a defensive
posture, always fighting the last remark while they move on to new targets.
"Well played," it might be said. But such an individual shouldn't be invited
into your house. He cannot sit with honor among his targets, which are
more than half of us by a wide margin.
