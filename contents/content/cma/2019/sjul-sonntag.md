### The Sonntagsspitze

_July 4, 2019_

I had a morning free before a work event at the Achensee, so I hiked up from
the Achenkirche Christlumlift parking lot to the Moosenalm behind. At one point a cow ran down a steep hill at me. This was scary!
I escaped into trees. Then a dog came along. He saw me, growled, lowered his head and came stalking towards
me. I figured I was about to get bit. I said "BACK!" and held my hiking poles defensively. After a few
more steps the dog turned around. Later I saw his owner who adopted a perplexed face on hearing my story.
"Was?!" he said, clearly disbelieving that his dog could act with violent intent. This was very irritating.
I left him with a few choice words.

Anyway, from the Moosenalm, I followed what was marked on the map as a trail up to the Sonntagsspitze.
But it's no trail -- it's just a watercourse up a very steep slope (I've submitted a correction, and this
trail should soon disappear from all OpenStreetMap-derived render layers in your life). Very adventureous.
Happily I reached the summit in steep grass and rocks, then went down through the Grobner Hals pass and the
road to the car.

1100 meters & 13 kilometers.
