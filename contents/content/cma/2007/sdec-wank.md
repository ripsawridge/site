### Wank
_December 6, 2007_

Two friends from work and I hiked up in the morning. Well, I was keen on skiing
again so I brought skis. They had snowshoes. We decided to take a southern
trail though, and it was clear there would be no skiing all the way up, so I
hid them and kept on. Near the summit there was enough snow for snowshoes, and
there were great views of town and the Wetterstein Range. Good hike! Came
quickly down and to work.
