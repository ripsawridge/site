### Wendelstein Night Hike

_September 4, 2017_

Barbara, her dog Mara and I started up the Wendelstein in the evening.
We walked from Bayrischzell to the house below the summit, going in
and buying a coffee for her and a beer for me, yeah! Mara got a
bowl of water. Technically they were closed, but Barbara used her
charm to win us a place while a couple guys who worked there talked
on the phone. I was cold so I'm wearing her sweater in the picture.

Mara was a good dog on the way down, sticking close to us in the dark.
