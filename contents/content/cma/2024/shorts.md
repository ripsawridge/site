TODO: missing a nice ski day with Josef and Kyrille.

### Zischgeles
_March 3, 2024_

After staying the night in Axams, I got up early and skinned up Zischgeles.
What a huge mountain! Entertaining scrambling to the summit from the ski depot.
The sun came out right at the summit, which was nice because it had been
cold, cloudy, and sometimes too windy. I took the left variant down, visiting
a hanging valley west of the normal ascent way.

### Schöntalspitze
_March 2, 2024_

What a great ski tour. Well, the snow in the lower section was quite difficult
refrozen crust. But the upper section was great. Tiring skinning in the last
100 meters to the ski depot. In fact, I slipped and got a muscle cramp in
my left arm trying to stay attached to the slope! A good day.

### Wildbarren
_March 1, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up the road, then the north ridge, and down
the southwest side. Wonderful day.

### Sulzberg

A great hike with Barbara and Sammy

### Kranzhorn

Me, Barbara and Sammy enjoyed ourselves here.

### Hike above Klausen
_January 27, 2024_

Interesting visit to the abbey above the town on the hillside. I prayed
a bit in the church, then wandered back into the cold, cold valley floor
of the Tinnebach. Thence up and back around towards the sun by an old
mine, and out into the sun on the road down to Villanders, where I looked
in vain for a restaurant. Galumpfed thence down to Klausen and a
early dinner in a good pizzeria. About 1100 meters up and down.

### Königsanger
_January 26, 2024_

Nice hike up Königsanger from Verdings. I got a hitch down from the official
parking lot back to Verdings from a nice cross-country skiing fella who
lives in Feldthurns down the road. He grew up nearby, nice guy. I used
snowshoes for the upper half, though snow became wet, deep and heavy on
the way down. Day started out sunny, later with ominous clouds.

### Feldalphorn ski
_January 19, 2024_

Skied up and down the Feldalphorn. Snow not super awesome.
It was very cold. I used a little video camera to film, but threw the
footage away (boring).

### Ski with Josef and Kirill
_January 14, 2024_

Great day with Josef and Kirill on Gerstinger Joch. We didn't visit the
true summit, but came close. Pretty nice snow! On the way down, we lost
Kirill for a while, and had a fun time searching with avalanche beacon
on the slope.

### Kranzhorn
_January 5, 2024_

Nice hike up and down.
