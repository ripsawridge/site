<h3>Tuesday</h3>


I had my usual breakfast of cereal, bread and butter. I also took some extra
pieces of bread and pats of butter to serve as lunch. I was getting pretty
crafty!


Today I wanted to make it to Arolla, a pretty long ways away, normally two or
three days journey. But I'd talked to Kris on the phone and it sounded like good
weather would come tomorrow, and then be finished by Saturday. A few days ago
some guys told me about the scenery in that neighborhood, and I wanted to visit
in the best weather.


With such thoughts I happily boarded a lift at 8 am to save some climbing above
Zinal. Continuing up through the ski area, and grateful for the lift, I thought
what a fantastic place this would be to come with Kris and the kids in the
winter. Great scenery and skiing terrain (that is, it _seemed_ gentle enough for
us). I was sobered to see how the snow line had come down in the night. Looking
back to the meadows I walked through the day before, I saw they all had
considerable snow. Pretty soon I was crunching up roads of the ski area trying
to ignore a bulldozer furiously digging a deep trench. I hopped over the trench
and sidehilled up the slope, hiding from the machinery just as I hid from the
farmers the day before. Skirting a summit occupied by the top lift station, I
trotted down to the pass Col de Sorebois (roughly 2850 meters high). The view of
Lac de Moiry below was exciting.

Descending proved to be tricky. The grass was buried under snow, but the trail
was coated in a sheath of water ice. I nearly landed on my tailbone a few times,
then got wise and left the trail for the crunchier terrain on the side. Happy
for hiking poles, I lowered myself straight down the steep slope, which I shared
with a handful of deer. Meanwhile I thought about my options on the hike for the
day.


Some folks go over the Col de Torrent due west. From there the trail wanders
over meadows and down to the town of Villa. Others spend a delightful night
above the Glacier du Moiry at the Cabane du Moiry, up at the head of the
valley. They then double back to hike out over Col de Torrent or the pass I had
in mind: the Col du Tsate. This pass would allow me to walk above the lake on
the west side on a scenic trail through the meadows, and get my own good views
of the glacier not too far away from the high Cabane. This pass was also further
south and therefore closer to my goal of Arolla.


The Lac du Moiry has a tremendous dam, which I walked across. A cold wind
whipped up the lake, but occasional sunbreaks increased during the day. I
admired the somber, snowy peaks at the head of the valley, and stopped to rest
in the meadows when the sun was out. I got a blister on my heel and fixed it
right up with a band-aid that served well for the rest of the trip. Once leaving
the dam, I saw no one until reaching the village of Les Hauderes in the
afternoon. Leaving the trail for a while, I especially enjoyed a saunter up
fields of La Bayenna, where I passed a hidden little farmhouse. Thick,
luxourious grass made my boots wet. At the col I found snow as usual, and a
whole new world of views to the west. This was addicting to have such incredible
changes of scenery! However, clouds were thicker and darker on this side, and it
would prove to be the rainiest afternoon of the trip. Steep peaks above Les
Hauders rose into the mist (they were the Petite dent de Veisant and it's big
brother).

As I approached farm buildings I lost the trail again as usual. I believe it
wound it's official way along long low angle dirt roads. I was intent on
following the straightest line down to Les Hauders, where two valleys from the
south met to become the mighty Val d'Herens. So I had an intriguing time
crossing steep meadows, farms, roads and forests, eventually reaching the hamlet
of La Forclaz. This was the prettiest town I saw on the trip. Old Swiss houses,
clustered close together, just ancient! One was built in 1500, and stood on
those amazing stone stilts to keep rats out. Some old folks were sitting in
front of a house. What a place, so much history and so many stories here I was
sure.


A commuters trail led quickly down to Les Hauders, passing a cliff with bolted
sport climbs. "Have to remember that," I thought, temporarily forgetting my
rather poor attitude towards sport climbing.


In town I ordered a meal that I couldn't imagine what it would be (something
like the word "croutons"). It turned out pretty good, sort of cheese-covered
bread and ham in a pot. I called Kris who said "Dang, do you do any hiking at
all?" She's not used to cell phone reception in the mountains either! I replied
somewhat defensively, and was apparently stung enough by the critiscm to abandon
plans to take a relaxed bus to Arolla. Hitch-hiking wouldn't work, no one was
going up valley to Arolla. So I geared up for a rain walk, and stomped up road
then trail, eventually climbing 600 meters to Arolla in about 11
kilometers. Hiking in rain isn't too bad with an umbrella. You can take off the
wet Gore-Tex and be warm enough under the "warm dome" of the umbrella. At one
quaint village, I stopped to rest my feet on the porch of a sturdy house. It was
nice sitting and listening to the rain in a dry place.

In Arolla I made a friend named Eric. From the Netherlands, he was hiking the
opposite direction, but only for a few days. He'd had a great time and planned
to see the village of La Forclaz on the way out as I recommended. Eric told
fascinating stories about development projects in the jungles of Bolivia and
Ecuador. He is a Ph.D. student in sociology, and full of interesting ideas. It
was a great set of conversations after some kind of lonely evenings. We were the
only ones in the hotel dormatory, a freezing cold side-building decorated
somewhat oddly as a child's room (complete with teddy bear on the dresser).


<hr>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>


In the morning I had to pay for both of us with my EC card - somehow the owner
thought we were together and presented one bill. It turned out well for me
though, because Eric paid me back in cash. I was "land rich, cash poor", and
this boon would allow me to stay in huts away from roads for a few days. "Ciao!"
I called, leaving early to crunch up the snow that came right to the edge of
town. I was happy for my full-length gaitors many times on this trip, especially
today - the snowiest of all days.


It didn't take long to lose the trail above town. As they had before, deer
tracks across the steep slopes showed the most efficient way, eventually gaining
the trail again. I walked beneath a glacier all cold blue and white descending
from the Pigne d'Arolla (3790 meters). Sadly the peak itself was shrouded. The
stillness of snow muffled everything.

I was excited about some ladders that allowed a quick descent from the Pas de
Chevres. For more skittish folk, an alternate pass 200 feet higher allowed a
ladder-free descent. Unfortunately, I got the names mixed up and went to the
high pass instead, having to take real care on the steep snowed-up trail on
either side of the col. I cursed mildly at having missed the exciting
ladders. But the expansive new view mollified me somewhat. The massive Lac des
Dix in the distance would be my companion for miles. And below me, the Glacier
du Cheilon could be crossed to visit the high lookout Cabane des Dix. Folks with
more time sometimes spend the night there, certainly with a great view of the
beautiful Mont Blanc de Cheilon (3869 meters).


Once down from the pass I hopped and slipped along in a massive boulderfield. I
lost a great deal of time, first following tracks that took me the wrong way
long enough, that I realized it would never work out. Boulders covered in thick
or thin layers of snow, with 5 foot deep holes in between are never fun to
traverse. Some people came up, I thought from the lake. I asked if they came
from the lake and they said no, so I couldn't get on their trail. There was no
other trail! Later I would learn that they did come from the lake and I really
should have gotten on their trail. For now though, I just figured I was on my
own again, so after eating an apple and some sausage on the level glacier I
descended straight down towards the lake. This was tedious, but doable, until a
horrifying black cliff running alternately with water or ice blocked my
path. "Oh crap!" I thought. The trail to the lake was now high above and blocked
by cliffs. I found by side-hilling steep rubble I could keep descending. I
thought I was home free, but another smaller hidden cliff blocked me, this time
with a scenic waterfall. Scouting along the top of the cliff, I found one place
that would allow a hiking descent. Sure enough, elk tracks marked the way. I
slipped a little near the bottom of the impromptu path, then realized folks on
the trail on the other side of a gorge were watching me carefully. "Hi," I
thought, and continued my descent. Eventually I must have made it to safety,
because they lost interest and kept hiking up.

Somewhat proud of my "wilderness descent" but also annoyed by the time and
energy it took, I crossed a suspension bridge at the head of Lac des Dix. The
sun was coming out, and soon great views of the Aiguilles Rouges d'Arolla
soothed me. Awesome peaks and sun on both sides of the lake kept me agog for a
long time. The lack of concentration allowed me to lose my warm hat somewhere in
here. Hours later, I let out a wail of pain - I'd had that hat for 5 years! Boy
had it been warm.


But these were minor concerns. The sun was melting the snow as I hiked up to the
Col des Roux (2804 meters). I conversed in German with some day hikers, then
admired the view from the top with a Dutch couple. The view was great,
but...down on the south side the landscape had been altered rather
sadly. Building the massive dam at the base of Lac des Dix required so much
gravel quarrying, they had heavily altered this pretty basin with two
lakes. Areas seemed to be cut out into gravel squares, with little roads
side-hilling between them. I only had to descend a few minutes to reach my home
for the night - the Cabane de Prafleuri. Actually there are two buildings, one
is apparently being decomissioned. I sat and drank a beer, looking at maps and
reading from the nice book collection in the hut. I was getting used to a beer a
day!

Later a big friendly group came in, and I enjoyed a rousing dinner with
them. There was an American couple from Spokane and some Scottish "Munro
baggers". The dinner was great, plenty of meat and potatoes.

<h3>Thursday</h3>


A blue sky day! Wow was I lucky. I wished everyone in the hut luck and hiked
away quickly as I could, crunching up through the "quarries," following the
trail in crunchy snow with my boots still wet from the day before. Some of us
had tried to cozy our boots up to a heater, but the warden shut all the heaters
off right after dinner. After about 1000 feet of hiking up, I rounded a buttress
to reach the Col de Prafleuri (2987 meters). In the last minutes before the
pass, I was admiring what looked like an easy route up an elegant mountain. The
Glacier de Prafleuri contours elegantly up to the summit of Rosablanche (3336
meters). Come to think of it, now that I have a good look at the map...it would
have been a fine variation! If you don't mind a little glacier walking of
course. You could then descent the Grand Desert glacier to regain the trail.

At the pass a woman surprised me by coming up the other side. It's far from the
next day's hut. I followed her tracks down into a pretty basin with 3 lakes
below the Grand Desert Glacier. It's a barren place without snow, but for me it
was a winter wonderland - crystals sparkling like jewels among the blue lakes
and sky. I liked this place a lot. Still, I was pretty tired at the top of the
next pass, Col de Louvie (2921 m). I lost the trail, or actually, the tracks
left the trail, and I kept the trail and was rewarded by 2 feet deep snow to
posthole through!

At the top and gradually below it was one of the best views of all. This amazing
torqoise lake called Lac de Louvie nestled in the basin below. Above it across a
deep valley was the monster peak Grand Combin, over 4000 meters high, with
glaciers spilling in every direction. What's better, the trail gently contoured
across the basin (well, after a tedious snowy boulderfield), letting me
continually admire the scene. Locally, things were dramatic too. The ground
below the trail was steep, and little snow avalanches had come loose from the
grass slopes above, making for exciting work climbing across the debries without
slipping for an unpleasant ride. I was constantly taking pictures here. I met
some people and exchanged news. Soon there were Ibex everywhere. Little herds
would move their heads in unison, watching me carefully. When I finally reached
my final pass for the day, Col Termin (2648 meters), I was so excited by the
scene that I scrambled up a little peak to the south. An older man at the pass
tried to convince me not too, citing the danger of slippery snow. I said I'd be
careful, but he wasn't reassured. "They all say that" I could imagine him
thinking. Anyway, I safely returned to see him hobbling on his way to the east,
while I turned north. My trail traversed a high hillside of the Bagnes valley
for a few scenic miles, then entered a large meadowy basin with the usual
night's hut, Cabane du Mont Fort perched on a crest in the upper slopes. I was
pretty tired when I got there. This is one of the biggest "full days" of the
usual tour. I ordered a beer and a coke, and sat to admire the Grand Combin AND
the other new spectacle for the day - the Mont Blanc Range! For the first time,
I was seeing that compact, sharp range of granite and ice. It still looked very
far away.

Leaving the hut, I hiked another hour to reach the top of a lift station called
Les Ruinettes. I just hopped on and an instant later I was down in Verbier,
which appeared to be a happening ski-town for the rich and famous. My knees were
happy to avoid the 2000 feet of descent to get there.


A high ridge stood between me and the Mont Blanc Range. I think it would be neat
to climb over it, as trails exist. But the traditional hike goes into the valley
and through the towns of Sembrancher and Orsieres to reach Lac de Champex for
another wilderness walk. Unfortunately, I would skip this day due to my short
schedule. I hired a taxi to take me down from Verbier and back up to Champex to
the west. This was expensive - 140 Euros! If I had known it would cost that
much, I don't know...maybe I would have at least hiked down to the valley from
Verbier. It took the taxi a long time because of all the switchbacks descending
and re-ascending.

At Champex I checked into a hotel, having dinner with a really nice couple from
New Zealand. They were in a tramping club, and were both skilled in search and
rescue. They told me some great stories from the "Southern Alps." They knew Sir
Edmond Hillary! The only bad thing about the hotel was that the owner turned up
loud techno music at 2 am in the bar, right below my room. I awakened from a
great, sound sleep and blearily wandered down to ask what the heck was going
on. The owner came up behind me in the dark and touched my hip. This frightened
her, and she screamed, causing me to yell too. The bar door flung open and
another woman stared at us. Then they laughed and promised to turn it
down. STill a bit miffed, I went back upstairs. The next day I found out it was
a birthday party for the second woman. It's funny, many other people were
awakened too, but didn't wonder about it. It was so loud the bed was shaking and
something made of glass was vibrating with the bass. Jeesh! Oh well, that was my
punishment for skipping a day of the hike!
