I'd threatened to take the family for an overnight trip to a hut for at
least a year, and finally the stars lined up. Kris and I schemed to keep
the cost down. Membership in the alpine club made lodging half price, but
dinner and breakfast was still pretty expensive. In the end, by bringing
our own breakfast we got in and out for about 60 euros. Not bad for a family
of four for dinner, board and lunch the next day. We also had our own room.
Next time we'll save more by sleeping in the common room, but the boys
were so enchanted with their bunk beds!
  
  
There was a lot of traffic leaving the city, but eventually we were in
LÃ¼sens and making an early afternoon hike. The weather was beautiful, but
a bit cold, and fresh snow decorated the peaks from about 2900 meters elevation.
  
  
The boys were good hikers, but prone to sudden bouts of extreme tiredness.
It took something interesting to wake them up. Once I ate some berries
and tried to get them to try them too. They were blueberries, and that
got us through a steep section.

We found a good picnic place on a knoll and ate looking across at the
waterfalls I'd climbed in previous winters. Kris made delicious salami
sandwiches, and a tubular container of Pringles (TM) was a great idea.
The boys played with their Lego men a bit. These are a great idea...if
each kid is allowed to bring two Lego men, it is enough of a toy to satisfy
them the whole weekend. The man can be placed in a natural environment
of rock and heather, where he can experience alien attack, avalanche, menacing
helicopters, and all manner of similar fun!

We rounded a corner then made a long pleasant traversing hike up to the
Westfallenhaus, which looked impossibly distant. Sheep grazed the mountain
above us. We arrived in late afternoon, and immediately booked a private
room. The boys fell in love with the bunkbeds, and we all hung out in our
beds for an hour or so. Kris invented a game where the boys had to leave
the room, then come in and find where she'd hidden a Lego man. That was
great fun.
  
  
We had dinner, then walked around the hut, where the boys found a dog
to play with, and we all munched on cookies. As it got dark, we went in
and went to bed, the boys so happy in their top bunks.

Early in the morning I woke up, put on contact lenses, grabbed my iPod
and a candy bar, and snuck out to hike up the Schoentalspitze. I think
it took 1.5 hours up, and there was snow on the summit block that had to
be negotiated. A cold wind competed with the weak morning sun on top, and
the view made me linger. Getting my fill, I hurried down, sometimes running
thanks to some good loud music that fit the trail. Back at the hut we ate
breakfast, and I took the kids for a nature hike while Kris relaxed in
a sun chair. We found a big boulder and set up a space station on top,
piling smaller rocks as places to hide. Then I napped in the meadow while
the wars raged on between various factions of a broken alliance.

It was time to head down! At the hut I played guitar for a while, teaching
a little girl how to play the all important "power chord." We hiked down,
doling out treats of chocolate when things got boring. Kris invented the
"no pooping on (a surprising object)" game, which still entertains us regularly!

We stopped in Garmisch for a couple hours of swimming on the way home.
I jumped off the high-dive and landed funny, such that my teeth hurt for
an hour! The boys loved the slides.
  
  
It was a great first-overnight hike!
