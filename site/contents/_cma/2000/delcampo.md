Mike Adamson and I hiked to Gothic Basin and scrambled up Del Campo Peak. The
way was gloomy and foggy for miles, but we had plenty to talk about, both being
very enthusiastic about the cascades and future climbing ideas.  The rough trail
crossed waterfalls that I had last visited two years ago with my nephews Steven
and Sam. We passed an abandoned mining structure on the mountainside, then
continued up to the basin, and Foggy Lake. We couldn't see any mountains in the
murk and I was getting a little discouraged. If something didn't appear, we'd
have to try and wring some pleasure out of the foggy forests. This is hard,
because it usually depends on being able to name various plants, and I suck at
this.

So we climbed slopes above Foggy Lake on a nice way trail, finally
coming to a snowfield and hearing voices echoing eerily somewhere
above. Without ice axes, we didn't like the long icy traverse
delineated by their tracks, so we headed up and left, where other
voices in the murk shouted. We came to a high saddle with scrub
trees, and saw a great cliff, here on the north west side of Del
Campo. Three dejected fellows sat on a rock outcropping.
{\em "Yeah, we thought this was the way, but I'm not going up that!"}
said one. We could see that the cloud cover ended just
some hundred feet above our heads - a mixture of blue and
steaming white. We saw that the pinnacle was drawn against a
sharp blue sky up there. My desire for sun led me on a hunt for
the summit. I found
a lower angle area of the great cliff on the opposite side.
The rock was still steep, but with great in-cut holds. One of
the three decided to try a loose lower-angle gully just to my
right. As he slipped and slid among tiny pebbles, he wisely
backed off. 


After about 100 feet, I came to a rappel/belay sling. This told
me I was perhaps in over my head. But I was near the ridge crest,
and thought I could follow it to the summit. I kept going,
protected only by the clouds that prevented me from seeing the
full exposure. But really, the rock was delightful! I promised
to come back with a rope sometime and do it right. The crux
was edging up the side of a chock-stone to gain the ridge crest.


Once there, I was above the clouds! {\em "Oh my god."} All the principal
summits of the region were up there too. Sloan crumbled in the sun,
Glacier Peak, Columbia, Keyes. Interestingly, Gothic Peak was hidden, 
as it was just a little smaller than Del Campo. Even better, I had this
marvelous, sinewy ridge crest, and at it's end were a startled
bunch of five looking at me wide-mouthed. "How did he get there?"
I heard. Concentrating on my task, I savored the last moves, and
arrived at the summit. This delightful party of five were impressed
by my route, and they laughed when I said I'd bring a rope to
"do it right." They were a fun bunch, I got some sunscreen from them,
ended up in their group photo shots, and exchanged witty banter.
Some of them were in the fabric business, and I learned something
about the production of nylon and taffeta. This was the best chance 
meeting with like-minded strangers I'd ever had on a summit.


The two men and three women nimbly scrambled down, being very, very
good at leaving loose rocks in place. I had a little trouble keeping
up, but learned much from their "quiet" loose-mountain technique. 
For this side of the peak was piled with stones on ledges and
frost-fractured licheny blocks. A few scrub trees, then slabs and
snow, and we said goodbye. They seemed like some kind of private 
"mountain goat" club.


Somewhat tired, we found a lot to laugh about as we invented the concept of
graded scrambling - ie a 4.11c or a hard 3.6 red-point.  Much riffing on the
concept, and sketches for films or magazines ensued. This was a great way to
pass the time, because soon we were walking the mile of road back to the truck,
and our day of mountain fun came to an end. At the trail-head, we met a weary
duo who had tried to climb East Wilman's Spire from the bushwhacking, west
approach.  Been there, done that...


Thanks to Mike Adamson for a fun day in the mountains!
