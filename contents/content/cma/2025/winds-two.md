## Approach Day

After driving down from Boise and sleeping in Pinedale, we hiked up into
the Cirque, meeting many parties. Great weather, and easier-than-expected
hiking, at least to Big Sandy Lake.

We set up camp and prepared for the climb the next day.

## Climb of Wolf's Head

We used the Mountain Project [Wolf's Head East Ridge](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105848762/east-ridge) route description as a guide, which was really
good. Specifically their advice about doing a long simul-climbing "pitch"
from the start to a little ledge below the First Tower, then belaying four
pitches to get through the towers, then again simul-climbing to the summit.
This worked out really well.

But first we had to get up to the ridge crest. We hiked in the dawn up the
trail to a point where boulders and scree reach a high point on the south
face of the connecting ridge between Wolf's Head and Pingora. We left the
trail to ascend this, noting the steepening gully/chimney above the fan
of rock, and wondering if we should go up that a while, or step to the left
and follow grassy ledges which made gentle ascending traverses of the south
face. We chose the latter, however, pretty soon I hit my scrambling limit
and stopped to get harness on. Steve gave me a belay and I went up, then
back right then left again on a higher grassy ledge.

I belayed at an apparant choice point: either continue reasonably up and left
on the current grassy ledge, or make an exposed bouldering move up and right
to reach a higher ledge. We were somehow convinced that by following the easiest
line (up and left), we'd end up on a smooth and impassable slab. So every time
I chose that direction I apologized loudly, but dang it, it just worked great!

Finally, I set off for a long pitch to the top, going once again, up and left
on nice 3rd and occasionally 4th class ledges. Steve hollered up "you'll probably
find yourself on a slab!", giving voice to our rather pessimisstic inner mood,
however, after a few moves I found myself on the broad low-angle ledge about
50 meters below the crest. "Nice!" I said, rather surprised. I brought Steve up
and we walked over to a notch a bit east of the low point on the ridge crest.
There were a few moves of 5.0 in the chimney beneath the notch, then we were
on top.

Moral of the story: take the easiest ledges, don't feel bad about going far
to the west on them. We did go up and right once, pretty early in the precedings.
We had many signs of passage (molded footsteps in grass/heather) on our ledges.

In the hours of pleasant climbing to follow, we saw several parties belaying
within the grassy ledges, all on the much steeper ground further east, in and
near the great gully/chimney atop the scree and boulder fan. My impression is
that there must be real 5th class climbing in there.

Steve took off for the first pitch, enjoying an exciting long and narrow slab
with huge drops on both sides. The terrain eased for a while, then steepened
into cracks and corners, now in a bit of welcome sun. The route looked
somehow improbable, but the rock was amazing. We had a pretty big rack, so he
was able to protect well despite going for many pitches (I'd guess at least 5).

*A soloist doing the Cirque Traverse*

Steve built a gear belay somewhere near our target notch. He brought me over,
then we were able to move that belay a few meters to the west to a better ledge
with a fixed sling pinched between boulders. A soloist came through, and hollered
down some advice about the chimney above. I should put my back on the east wall.

That was good advice! I scrambled up easy terrain to the chimney, hung my
backpack between my legs, and got into it. After entering high, I stayed
near the bottom of the chimney, then followed a rib of rock near the end
on the north side of the ridge up to a ledge, where I built a gear belay.
Steve would like this, haha!

Indeed, he came up, spared the worst of any thrutching and cursing by the
grapevine of good advice. Steve sent me off on the "piton pitch," a slippery
traverse marked by 3-4 pitons. I was traversing the north side under the
Second Tower. Quite nice moves to another broad ledge.

*With Steve following that interesting pitch*

The next pitch was such fun. Up a lieback crack 10 feet or so to a short finger
crack right on the golden crest. Then right to a glorious hand traverse with
lots of exposure. I had a great time slotting in cams and clipping the rope
directly to them as I crabbed rightward. Eventually I rounded a notch out of
sight, then walked a foot-ledge just below the crest on the south side
(brave young people can balance on the ridge top or scootch forward *au chavel*).
I brought Steve in from a cozy cavelet belay.

Now for the last technical pitch...Steve sent me out from the cozy cave on a
hand traverse in a rather wide crack with a rounded edge. Yikes! Feet were
scarce, too. Halfway across this intimidating traverse, I found a breakup which
accepted an orange Metolius 4-cam. After another 4-5 meters, I reached a corner
with some gear placements and a chance to get my feet up on a good ledge.

*Steve coming around the corner on the south-side hand traverse and chimney*

Now I needed to follow another hand traverse leading downward to the base of
a chimney. This went easily enough, though the final moves felt slippery.
The location felt odd and "out there." I felt better getting some gear in the
chimney at a steep bulge, surmounted with some hand and foot jams. Whew!
Above this, easy terrain led to the "Birth Canal," which I solved as a
breech birth, my pack on a sling behind me. Soon Steve was with me and we
marvelled over the interesting pitch.

He took off now, making for the summit. However, it turned out to be easier to
belay me across after a 40 meter pitch marked first by relatively easy ledge
walking, then a few steep moves up corners and cracks at the end. He took off
again, and soon we were making the final moves to the summit separated by
about 20 meters of rope. Nice! It was 12:40 pm.

Despite the great views, we were eager to begin the rappels. Perhaps because
of the eerie sight I'd seen 2 weeks before, after 10 pm by Shadow Lake,
looking up at the mountain and seeing two desperate headlamp beams
apparently searching for the rappel stations. I was smoking a cigar after
our big day on Shark's Nose and Overhanging Tower. While I watched, they
successfully descended 50 meters or more, but then the lower lamp began
swinging from one side to the other, apparently looking for an anchor.
Shortly after, the lights went out. Presumably, they would wait until dawn
to continue their descent.

Steve set off on the first abseil, then the second. To find the third station,
we coiled the rope and walked down a little trail. For the fourth rappel,
there was a similar short scramble to find the anchor. On that rappel, we
could see trails and ledges leading off east towards the notch between
Wolf's Head and Overhanging Tower.

We walked those ledges for a few minutes, then reached the station for the
fifth rappel, somewhat hidden around a corner. Straight down that, then we
followed faint trails and natural lines off east again. Here, we ended up
at a discontinuity after 10-15 minutes of scrambling. A cairn and a sling
with a rappel ring indicated a short but steep rappel, then a continued
scramble off east (or so I surmised).

We made the (overhanging) rappel, less than 20 meters. Then sure enough,
cairns and faint trail led further east with a bit of up and down. Soon we
were deposited in the gully and could follow a steep path up to the pass.
Great! We knew there was another way on this last section that stayed a bit
higher. Either way though, it seems that six rappels are standard.

Descending towards Cirque Lake, we found a nice rappel opportunity that followed
a hidden golden slab on skiers left of the gully. This was a great help.
The descending that followed was only minimally tedious. Soon we were boulder
hopping to grassy slopes above and along the lake. By my photos, I see we
were on fairly harmless terrain above the lake at 3:20 PM.

We spent the evening resting, reading and exploring the basin a little bit.

## Pingora Climb

I really have to thank Steve for assenting to the climb of Pingora.
He was just worn out, and didn't get good sleep. If I was as tired as I
think he was, I would have slept in, and planned to hike out a day early.
But he called out that it was time to wake up and gear up, so I began
the necessary actions. Change out of sleeping clothes, put water in the
oatmeal, get the rack in the little daypack, stow harness, rock shoes
and helmet, etc.

Soon we stood at the trail junction where the approach to the SW Buttress
route (aka "K-Cracks") on Pingora starts. We couldn't imagine how a 3rd class
trail could get us to the base of that route, however, it really does! We
enjoyed scrambling from ledge to ledge, with the occasional switchback in a
hidden forest-ledge. Finally, an exposed step-around to a slabby face lets you
know you are pretty high up. After a few moves more, you are on a broad and
low-angle ridgetop, and can mosey up to the start of the climbing.

*Steve approaches the first pitch on a beautiful morning*

We went up to the first pitch, a rather disconnected 5.6 crack, above which
we'd traverse to the right about 20 feet to stand at the base of a long
dihedral. I found this first pitch harder than expected, and rather cold!
But it was mercifully short. Now in the sun below the dihedral, we had to choose
the right line. Hmm!

I chose the left side, for the nice hand-crack leading up. This was very fun.
However, higher, it was clear that I was getting off the main line. I made
an exposed bouldering mantel move to regain the main dihedral and continued
for another 15 meters of great climbing. Here was a ledge on the left side
that seemed appropriate for a belay. I brought Steve up and he sent me off
again. The crux of the day followed: a steep finger-crack on the right side
of the dihedral for a few moves to reach a ledge in the center.

Wow, very fun. This felt more like what I dimly remembered the Sierras to
be. Stemming, hand and foot jams, edges, pockets, slabby foot moves below
liebacks...just a continual stream of granitic conversation, a call and
response that totally absorbed my attention. Too soon, the difficulties ended,
and I followed slabby terrain to the crest of the buttress just below the
upper headwall.

*Steve finishes the technical climbing*

We decided to climb the 5.6 variation left of the famous 5.8 "K-Crack." It
begins above a bolted rappel anchor, so we moved the belay over there. This was
another entertaining pitch up cracks and corners, probably about 40 meters long.

Steve arrived and we unroped for the scramble to the top. Here, we granted ourselves
the time to enjoy the summit-life we'd missed the day before, taking various silly pictures,
and gawking endlessly at the beautiful and austere sight of the East Ridge of
Wolf's Head modelling an alluring sweep below us. There was a hedonic pleasure in
contemplating that sweep and how we'd traversed it the day before, like ants
spiralling a string of folded dimensions and somehow getting away with magic.

Back near our rope, we joked with another party, then began the four abseils.
All of this went great, though you should tie a knot in your rope-ends for
the first and second ones, especially (we had a 60 meter rope). It began
to sprinkle as we hiked down, though never turned into a downpour.

We had a nice restful afternoon, then hiked out the following morning.
I had a great talk with a CDT hiker about living in a van and working, then
heard some hilarious stories from a guy who works for American Alpine Institute
in Bellingham, where my story began almost 30 years ago...

Big thanks to Steve and the Wind Rivers!
