I hiked up from Stans, following the bee-line straight from town up to
the little broken-down house 1400 meters up the slope. I listened to
interesting podcasts, especially one about the archeology of Sodom.
Fascinating! It seems that God rained hellfire on the city as the Bible
states. What a strange story that is...I think a mark of it's truth is the
rather poor behavior of Lot, who, rather than turning over the angels to
the wicked men of the city "so that we may know them," was happy to turn
over his virgin daughters to them. What the heck? It is a dreamlike story
(a very bad dream). It is good to have a God who reaches into the world
to correct us, I am certain.

Anyway, my feet became cold on the march to the summit in recent and sometimes
knee-deep snow. Bad weather was brewing to the west. I decided to continue
along the ridge to the east and come down to Jenbach. This went well enough
for a while, but gosh, the toes were getting cold. I should have worn thicker
socks! Finally I reached a little hunting stand where I could leave the
ridge to the north where I saw tantalizing dry ground below at the
Heiterlahn Alm. I wished for an ice axe as I traversed steep slopes in
the snow. In total I made 4 traverses to stay on the trail which cunningly
avoided steep ground amid latschen bushes, scruffy cliffs and smallish trees.
I had old tracks of a beast to follow (probably Gämse). Near the bottom, I
had to reclimb because I'd left the trail and ended up, predictably enough
in a miserable grove of latschen and rotting snow. I limped on frozen feet
to the Hochleger at the Alm, squeezed the water out of my socks and set to
drying and warming them. Whew!

Below the Alm, steep trail and many Gämse around got me down to the
Rödelhüttenweg. Great views of the Rofan Mountains from here. I walked through
Jenbach, then another 6 kilometers back to my car in Stans. I rested aching
feet and lay on the grass for a while at the Tratzberg castle.

An interesting, varied day -- and a lesson on the importance of good, thick
socks for walking in snow in trail runners! 1600 meters up/down and about 20
kilometers.
