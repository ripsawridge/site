### Buchstein, "Man oder Memmel" (8-/A0)
<i>November 25, 2012</i>

Georg and I had a few hours on Sunday. We hiked up to the Buchstein and climbed
"Man oder Memmel" (roughly, "are you a man or a wimp?"). It was my first time
on rock since August, wow! The first pitch was a tough wake up call, but I
eventually enjoyed myself (6+). Georg took the 7- and 8- pitches. Hilarity
ensued when he placed a bad cam on the 8- to try and protect the crux, and it
pulled out when he rested on it. Finally he got through, good job! I pulled on
everything I could find in here...standing on slings, etc.! Another deceptively
tricky 6+ pitch with some dangerous loose rock, then a final grade 5 scramble
to the top. We enjoyed the view for a while, then tagged the Rossstein on the
hike out, finding another way down from that peak on a southwest ridge (grade
II).
