### Pu'u Manamana
_December, 2007_

I went on this intriguing hike on Oahu. It gains a knife-edged ridge, even
features some rock climbing on the very exposed crest. Then it becomes an
endurance fest up and down along a completely grown-over jungly ridge before
taking a side ridge down. I ruined my shoes in the jungle muck! Still, it was a
good challenging hike. Pictures later, some of them are great.
