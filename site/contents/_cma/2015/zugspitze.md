I did a solo hike up the Zugspitze via the HÃ¶llental Klettersteig
path. I had full mountaineering gear, because it had recently snowed
a tremendous amount. It was quite interesting! Especially getting
onto the Klettersteig, where I had to use a kind of emergency side
path because the crevasse was too large for the ordinary way.

Higher, there were some creepy bottomless snow gullies. I must say,
it was quite the adventure.

I continually wondered, what the hell am I doing here as I looked
into these "black maws" of ice and snow.

This image entranced me.

So much that I drew a line of my route on it.

This wonderful couple gave me money to take the lift down because
I forgot my wallet in the car! I was able to transfer them money
once I got home.
