Georg and I got to spend the weekend climbing ice in Val Gardena. I'd always
wondered about ice climbing in the Dolomites, and apparently they've had a good
season. Somehow I'm too tired to write it all up, but we had a great time. The
icefalls right in the town of St. Christina were especially inviting.
