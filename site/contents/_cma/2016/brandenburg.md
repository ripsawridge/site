## Bayreuther-Hütte

I wanted to introduce Barbara to a longer hike, so we headed to
the Brandenburger Alps to climb some south slopes above the Inn. Usually they
are free of snow much sooner than other aspects in the area.

We followed a steep trail passed a beautiful waterfall.

Eventually we reached the hut, and the amount of snow that loomed in the Rofan
Mountains above us convinced us to stop here. We ate some snacks and had a 
fantastic conversation. We followed a different way back, traversing a hillside
with plenty of rocks to boulder around in.

Roughly 1000 meters up and down.

## Plessenberg

Barbara and I hiked up the Plessenberg, also called Blessenberg.
We started from the little village of Schönau, following steep trail
passed the Ruraalm to the Ascherjöchl. Here, we followed the ridge to
the Plessenberg, dealing with some snow at the end. Then, hilariously,
on the summit it started snowing hard!

Soon we were hiking down the west side of the mountain to the Jocheralm.
Just below we found a trail that led down and back to the car on the
south forested slope of the mountain.

What a fantastic day out...about 1200 meters up and down.
