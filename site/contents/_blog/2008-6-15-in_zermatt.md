We are in Zermatt for the week with an amazing view of the Matterhorn
out our window. But today it's clouded over, and the family is huddling
under blankets. Brr! We need the sun! We are staying right across the street
from the 400 year old house/barns of the old town center. The houses seem
to huddle together for warmth. I couldn't imagine living here in the 17th
century!

Once we learned to buy groceries and not go out for exorbitant meals we
started having fun :-). The Glacier Express train was really nice (and
really expensive). We spent Thursday night in Chur, and it was kind of
a shock. From the train station we walked to our hotel which was in the
middle of the "red light district." Oh. The web site made it look like
a charming Swiss villa! But there were strip clubs and "sex cabins," and
noisy bars with people watching the soccer game. I never expected _that_ in
Switzerland! Rowan slept with Kris and I, thought I should put "slept"
in quotes. He was so excited to sleep with us that he beamed and grinned
and squealed for at least an hour. Then he tossed and turned violently.
Apparently Elijah slept like a log with Kris's parents.
  
  
The boys traveled really well on the trains. One thing kind of funny,
is the way Elijah says "hello" to everyone. He just boldly starts saying
hello until they finally answer. People try to ignore him but he doesn't
let them. Then he says "bye." Our Elijah, forcing the world to be more
civil! I think maybe he does that to relieve the anxiety of being among
lots of strangers: turn them into friends.
  
  
Kris is knitting me socks from yarn that she spun herself. One sock is
done and it's awesome.
