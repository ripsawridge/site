_Alas, no pictures! I forgot the camera at home! But I do have some iPod Nano footage (shaky)_
  
  
  
Adrian and I made a weekend trip to the Dolomites. His girlfriend Traudi
came along with us to get some relaxation in beautiful scenery while we
climbed. We drove down Friday afternoon, and after renting a taxi to the
Gardecci Hut, walked in the moonlight up to the Vajolet hut, where Pete
and I stayed during our June trip to the area. We had two bottles of wine
and potato salad with potatoes from Traudi's family farm in Romania. Delicious!
  
  
The next morning, after breakfast, we hiked to the base of the route.
Two other guys were in front and we figured our job would be easier because
we could follow them for route confirmation. That didn't really work out
as planned, however. As we got ready, a multitude of other parties converged
at the base. I scrambled up the easy first "pitch," to get in line just
in front of a party of three nice Italians, who we would see on and off
throughout the day.
  
  
Adrian took the first lead, a steep pitch generously endowed with holds
to keep the grade down. He belayed 50 meters up at the base of a steep
corner that had the crux moves of the climb (pitch 4 on the topo). I followed
and led through the crux, finding it most difficult where I needed to place
a large cam in an overhanging corner before traversing off right and up
to a steep but crumbly face. Adrian followed, then led up through a surprisingly
difficult wall up and left of the belay, which we estimated to be as hard
as the crux moves below. Later, a look at the topo revealed an easier way
up a white wall above the belay that lookd holdless, but actually had big,
camoflaged grips. From here, we continued a couple of pitches wondering
exactly where we were. The problem was that terrain was not difficult,
providing many options, and indeed, the wall is festooned with old pins
and slung belay stances. Losing the route is common in here!
  
  
I led easily up into a corner, then by a slung "sanduhr" (hourglass) traversed
left across a small face to then climb a rapidly easing corner to a stance.
I knew that the route makes a devious gentle traverse rightward in this
area, but neither we nor the party of three below could figure out where
it was, despite 2 topos and one italian detailed pitch description. I was
cautious because a friend had already [spent a night out in a cave on the face](http://easternalpsclimbing.blogspot.com/2009/05/steger-route-rosengartenspitze-e-face.html) due
to an error here. Adrian led off, inclined to follow the two climbers above,
though they seemed to be getting off route by going straight up a black
crack that one topo writes "NEIN!" over! Adrian searched for the right
way, knowing he should go right but not sure exactly how or where. Finally
he settled on a traverse of a difficult face, emerging on a ledge that,
to me and the Italians below, looked like nirvana: a perfect belay ledge.
But Adrian found only a few edelweiss plants. The Italians started up and
found the proper ledge 10 meters higher than Adrian. Now he had the unenviable
task of reversing his route, cleaning cams and nuts along the way. He did
this, and climbed up to the proper belay. It was costly, but overall, time
well spent because the error could have been worse!
  
  
Two really nice pitches followed, a IV+ and V, first cracks and face up
to the base of a steep corner (and crowded belay, with the Italians), then
Adrian led a stellar chimney/crack pitch that marked the halfway point
on our topo. Yes!
  
  
Three more straightforward pitches led up to the base of another beautiful
steep corner crack. Still, it was easy to get lost. The Italians headed
off right, missing the key climb behind a massive block in a chimney identified
on route maps (fun climbing, too). Later, confused, we ventured right to
follow them, then came back to the main line, a little apprehensive about
the steep faces they were climbing above! In the lower part of this section
I cowered under an overhang as two volleys of highspeed rock fall from
high above exploded around me. That distinctive fluttering sound is never
easy to hear! Again, Adrian got the V+ corner crack on his lead...I started
chiding him for stealing all the hard pitches. It was a really fun ropelength,
well protected by cams and the occasional piton.
  
  
Two moderate and fun pitches led up and right, closing off options as
a smooth yellow face loomed above us. Birds whooshed around the cliff at
high speed, and clouds began pouring through the low gap in the range to
the south. We caught the Italians again at a belay before the final chimney,
perched scenicly above a steep, yellow grade V face. They had had good
adventure on a line off to our right, and we'd heard them every now and
then around the corner for the previous 4-5 pitches.
  
  
I got the last full pitch. We'd put on jackets now, as the clouds through
the gap had spread and finally made it over the summit. Adrian, smiling
through gritted teeth said: "Please. No delay. Climb. I am cold." More
direct words were never spoken! I went up the final bit of the yellow face,
then into the chimney, favoring one side and then the other, with the crux
moves ascending a hand crack on the right side. Wow, what a pitch! I emerged
at a notch in the ridge, seeing the Italians scrambling the summit, coils
of rope in their hands. I couldn't find a good gear belay, and finally
just wrapped the rope around a section of the ridge. Adrian came up, pleased
as punch, then set off on a scramble to the summit. I coiled half the rope
and followed to the top. We stood under the cross and offered congratulations
all around! There were clouds to block the view of the Gardeccia, but valleys
and peaks to the north were visible. Swaths of green ridges were especially
impressive, constrasting so greatly with the big yellow and gray bulks
embedded into the clouds.
  
  
We descended easily to the north, scrambling on a ridge past an unnecessary
(in dry conditions) rappel anchor, then reaching a notch in the ridge to
make a 50 meter rappel to more scrambling. We passed a hut and continued
down to the Vajolet Towers, and then our own hut, just in time for dinner.
Traudi said she heard me and my loud voice for 20 minutes coming down the
canyon. Oops!
  
  
We had a great dinner, and finished with good wine, talk and a much-needed
hot shower. I was getting lots of German practice with Traudi, who explained
the history of the opera and many other interesting things. Adrian and
I resolved to climb the "Fedele" Route on Punta Emma the next day. A short
climb, it would allow us to leave early and get home at a decent hour.
  
  
  

## Fedele Route, Punta Emma, V-, 11 pitches
  
  
I ended up basically scrambling the first pitch (IV+) due to a misreading
of the topo, oops! Finally at the end of the pitch I got a decent cam in
to protect the final moves up a slabby corner. I led the next pitch too,
a really fun V- corner crack. Adrian continued on easier but still interesting
terrain to a spot below a distinctive black crack. I climbed up to the
crack, placed a solid cam, then traversed left to a line of pitons in a
shallow, smooth corner. Amazingly, there was a small hidden hold just where
necessary. Clipping the last of three pitons was very awkward, as I was
already traversing out of the smooth corner along a line of holds leading
left. Now, up and left a long ways for a full 55 meter pitch to a 3 piton
belay on the right side of a buttress of imposing black rock, permanently
stained by waterfalls in the rainy season. Adrian came up and led an impressive
looking pitch with a short overhang directly above my belay. We talked
about how Fedele was a genius at finding easy routes up vertical faces,
both veterans as we are of the "Fedele/Dibona" [monster line on Piz Pordoi](http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/565724/Sass-Pordoi-the-Fedele-Dibona-.html),
improbably rated grade V. This smaller climb shared the serious feeling
of the larger, because of the vertical angle of rock all around you.
  
  
Adrian had combined two pitches, leading up into the final black chimney,
easily visible from trails below. In a repeat of the day before, I got
the final chimney moves, emerging on easy ground 100 meters below the summit.
Here we unroped, joking about my decision to climb without a pack (and
therefore without food and water). Basically I was tired of climbing with
a pack from the day before, and knew this climb was easy enough to allow
a break from the alpine traditions. Adrian tried to offer me water, which
I gallantly refused. Then he tried to offer me his favorite candy, a "Kinder
Pinguino" (children's penguin). When I refused that he called me an unprintable
name and all but forced me to accept it. Good fun!
  
  
We walked the summit, talking about past and future climbs to do. I remembered
being here with Pete two months before, thinking about how he'll be a dad
soon. Man, time flies!
  
  
Easily down with scrambling and a rappel, then to the hut and down to
Traudi, enjoying herself in the beautiful meadows near the Gardeccia Hut.
This was an amazing place, with families laying out on the grass, kids
running around, all beneath the fantastic towers of the central Rosengarten
ridge. It wouldn't have hurt Adrian and I to spend the day here, either.
  
  
The taxi and the drive home followed. Big thanks to Adrian and Traudi
for driving, companionship and the friendship of the rope!
  
  
  

## Detailed pitch descriptions
  
  
  
**Rosengarten Ostwand "Steger"**
  
  
P1 - II, scrambling.
  
P2,3 - IV+,V, Adrian combined these easily in 50 meters climbing cracks
and a yellow corner to a belay in the corner.
  
P4 - VI-, I led up from the corner to an overhang, then right and up a
sometimes-loose yellow face to a belay.
  
P5 - V+, Adrian led left and up from the belay in some hard moves, then
IV+ crack terrain to easier ground and a belay.
  
P6 - V, Michael led easily up to a corner, then traversed left at a block
(good nut) into an easier corner and grade III terrain to a belay on the
left of a gully.
  
P7 - IV+, Adrian, up the gully to then turn right after 25 meters beneath
a yellow corner and gain a yellow ramp. By no means continue up the corner
or veer left into a black crack ("schwarzer Riss" on german topos).
  
P8 - IV+, Michael, enjoyable easy but steep climbing up cracks, wandering
left then back right to a belay in a corner at the end. 30 m.
  
P9 - V, Adrian, up a steep crack which widens to a chimney. Climb first
on the right then the left wall to reach a nut and Sanduhr (hourglass)
belay. 40 m.
  
P10 - IV+, Michael, Follow a crack straight up into an easy gully. Higher,
the gully steepens to offer enjoyable grade IV climbing at it's exit to
a nut belay. It's easy to lose the route in the middle of this pitch by
veering right. 45 m.
  
P11 - IV, Adrian. Continue on easy (II) terrain to where the gully gains
more definition again and a distinctive huge block is wedged inside. Climb
behind the block to a two piton belay. 35 m.
  
P12 - IV, Michael. Don't be tempted rightward here, continue straight
up the chimney/gully where it steepens at a crack, then eases to a belay
below an impressive black crack. 35 m.
  
P13 - V+, Adrian. Climb the crack straight up past some pitons to a belay
on a ledge/terrace. 35 m.
  
P14 - IV, Michael. Follow a ramp up and right in very pleasant climbing
with big exposure below, but good holds always at hand. We found a 3 piton
belay. 45 m.
  
P15, 16 - IV, V, Adrian. Clip a piton 2 meters above and right of the
belay, then continue up gully/channels (we ignored the topo's idea of going
right and around a ridge). Emerge on a yellow face, climbing the easiest
line past a few pitons to a spectacular belay with the valley laid out
below. 50 m.
  
P17 - V+, Michael. Finish climbing the yellow face, and into a chimney
with the most difficult moves shortly before the exit, in a solid hand
crack on the right wall. Belay with gear and slings. 30 m.
  
P18 - III, Adrian. Climb a last slabby step on low angle ridge to where
the ridge melts into a low angle face. 25 m.
  
  
From here, scramble to the summit (II, 80 m).
  
  
**Punta Emma, "Fedele"**
  
  
P1 - IV+, Michael. Climb steep but grassy face directly below a striking
dihedral to a belay at the base of the dihedral. 30 m.
  
P2 - V-, Michael. Climb the dihedral with good cam and piton protection
to a belay where the angle lessons. 25 m.
  
P3 - IV, Adrian. Climb easy terrain in the gully up and right to a solid
crack (IV) and a three piton belay. 40 m.
  
P4, 5 - V-, IV, Michael. Climb easy ground to the base of an obvious black
crack. Look left of the crack for a line of pitons in a shallow black dihedral.
Ascend this, then continue left and up, past a two piton belay. I continued
up and left to a three piton belay at the right side of a black wall. 55
m.
  
P6 - V-, Adrian. Climb up enjoyable rock to a piton and exposed moves
over a slight overhang. Easily back left and up to a two piton belay. Also
possible to continue a bit into the chimney and another good belay. 20-40
meters, depending on option.
  
P7 - IV+, Michael. Climb the very nice chimney to easier terrain.
  
  
From here we scrambled to the summit on grade II terrain.
