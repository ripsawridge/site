<h2>Great White Books (5.6 R, Grade II)</h2>
<h3>June 21, 2003</h3>

After climbing Daff Dome, we still had the afternoon free.
We decided to finally visit Stately Pleasure Dome and climb an easy route.
Aidan hiked up steepening slabs and ledges to reach the base of
the climb. I followed but got distracted by a german father and daughter,
who I had to practice my rusty skills with: "Wie geht's, Krankenleute?"
Okay, I didn't really say "how's it going <i>SICKPEOPLE</i>?" I just said
"how's it going?" They were really friendly, and they were amazed how
I could walk up and down these slabs that they were crawling on, looking
for holds. I forgot something at the car and I heard Aidan laughing at
me from his high perch. 


I finally arrived, wheezing, and put Aidan on belay. From his notes, he 
"climbed cool easy flake (only pro) to gain the start of the Books
(huge chimneys/corners thus Books [nice]). Belayed at a block."
Access to the Haley Library and the generous endowment it provides has been
crucial to this project. I don't remember this pitch myself, as I was
scaring myself about the next one.



It was the Book, the Business, the yawning chasm. Rated 5.6 and no pro.
I laughed boldly at it's dark embrace! "What was that noise?" said Aidan.
"Um...that was me laughing boldly."


I used classic chimney technique, moving slowly and with lots of energy
expenditure. Occasionally I could rest my calf muscles by wedging with
my knees on one wall and back on the other. The pitch was about 100
feet long, and near the end I got nervous about falling. I simultaneously
wanted to sprint to the bolted anchor and crawl there carefully.
This produced a sort of brain embolism which I still carry.
I clipped in somewhat relieved.



Then Aidan arrived, somehow walking up the chimney without using his
hands, and taking only 3 minutes. Now I couldn't very well relate
my story of battling with demons and greasy rock on that pitch!
The next pitch had more of the same for Aidan, and I guess he felt
the drama of the Books a little more on the sharp end from this
journal entry: "...time time had some pro (<i>relief</i>)."
He built a three-nut belay at the top of the Books and belayed me up.


I led up and right along a seam to a piton, then hard left on a long
5.5 traverse to easier ground and a belay. We coiled up the rope and
scrambled down 3rd and 4th class slabs with a great view of Half
Dome in the distance. This was a great 4 pitch climb, highly recommended.
