### Hoher Fricken
_May 18, 2006_

A morning hike to the summit of Hoher Fricken. I parked just outside of Oberau,
and followed a nice path by a golf course. Then it turned up off the valley
floor on a steep narrow forest road, and soon because a steep trail. They
really know how to make their trails steep around here! I continued up in many
switchbacks, crossing the occasional stream gully, and even using hands on a
rock step here and there. Eventually I reached a pleasant bowl with bands of
snow. Kicking steps up the snowfields slowed me down a bit, and I wondered if I
should go for the summit or turn around. Suddenly I was at a saddle with an
amazing view of the Wetterstein Range! Then I looked at the relatively narrow
ridge leading to the summit. "Oh I need me summat!" I said aloud. It was a slow
15 minutes to get there from the saddle due to snow on the ridge top. But it
was so worth it! The view of Farchant, the Zugspitze and other snowy peaks was
fantastic (actually, "gigantisch" :-)). It took 2:15 to here, and I felt so
good that I decided to go down a different way: via a steep trail to Farchant.
Farchant and Oberau looked so close from up there. "I won't mind the flat walk
between them," I thought.

Boy was this trail steep, and often snowcovered for the first 300 meters down.
I came to puzzling drop offs and small ascents where I paused and scanned the
map closely. Sometimes I had to grab onto Latschen and lower myself down steep
crumbly slopes. "This is like the Cascades," I mused. Later I came to a road,
followed it the direction that looked down then got nervous when it started
climbing. So I went back the other way, wasting about 30 minutes following the
road to it's end on a logging landing. I did see an enormous, frightening ant
bed over there.

From road, I was back to trail after a while, and finally on the flats of
Farchant. Boy was I tired! Too tired to run more than a few minutes at a time
on the road back to Oberau. Mostly I enjoyed the little forest interpretive
center as I sauntered along. There would be a bench with the sign "Wildschule"
(wild school), or another bench with a great view stating "Garmischer Apotheke"
(Pharmacy for residents of Garmisch). I reached the car at 10:30, so the trip
down took just as long as the trip up (2:15).

This trip is a little long for a morning hike, but if you return the same way,
you could cram it in. It was about 4000 feet elevation gain/loss. Some pictures
to come.

The hike to the summit of Hoher Fricken via the Oberausteig passes through some
lovely meadows on the valley floor. The mountain in the background is the
Zugspitze.

Here is the town of Farchant from the summit of Hoher Fricken. The larger town
of Garmisch-Paternkirchen can be partially seen on the left.
