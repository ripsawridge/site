At long last, we had our chance to make a family climb of the Tridentina via
ferrata. 12 years ago on vacation, Kris and I climbed this...it was one of our
first via ferratas. She loved it, and long declared it to be her favorite one.

I'd been keeping weekends free so we could depart for Gardena on short notice
with good weather. I also knew that by mid-October we could expect snow on
ledges of this north facing wall, so I wanted to go before then. One Tuesday in
Munich, I idly checked the forecast to see three great days for the weekend down
there. Yes! Thursday night we booked a pension, and were joined by our friend
Cesar, veteran of a previous Dolomites adventure.

We headed down after work Friday, the adults breaking into the excellent Maple
Whiskey Cesar brought from Montreal. Woo hoo!

In the morning, Elijah said "my throat hurts!" Groan! I'd been fighting a cold
since the Oktoberfest night earlier in the week with my team at work. And maybe
I passed it to him. We decided to go anyway and just see how far we get.

Everyone had all the right gear, we were a small army! We marched from the pass
on the trail up and west, then traversing the mountainside below north faces. A
wrong turn meant we had to descent a loose scree hill ("Michael!" said
Kris). Finally we were at the base of the route. Smarties all around, then we
started up with Kris in front, Elijah, Cesar, Rowan and myself. Cesar and I had
ropes to secure the kids if needed. We wouldn't need these at all, but it was
the first time for the boys to have their own gear to clip with, and this did
take extra energy.

We climbed a long time, with Kris especially enjoying herself up in front,
basking in previous memories and feeling very free! Cesar took a bunch of
hilarious selfies. It's so much fun to be together out there with the boys,
too. What a perfect, perfect day and man, I am thankful to be a dad at this
stage of life!

We took a rest when the angle relented, then set off again. I climbed with
Elijah now, and did more of his clips for him because he got noticably more
tired. Above the waterfall, after a long steep section we made a short traverse
and I rigged a handline along a narrow ledge so we could have an extended rest.

Here, we could exit to an easier way to the hut. I was a little worried, because
Elijah was really tired. I'd already decided to go that way with him, but we
rested a while to see if there was improvement. I was still a bit amazed that he
put up no fuss and was content to go the easier way. Rowan was eager to continue
for the "crux," a couple of ladders and steep ground leading to the tiny
suspension bridge that marks the end of the route. I was super happy that Cesar
was there, so he could go with Kris and Rowan while Elijah and I took the exit.

Once I knew it was safe, I could unrope and walk the trail easily with
Elijah. We had a fantastic view of Kris, Cesar and Rowan on the climb which was
really impressive looking! I took many pictures. Later, we watched them cross
the bridge one at a time, and we whooped when each one stood at the midpoint of
the bridge.

Elijah and I hiked to the hut, where he collapsed into a nap. We got a nice
meal. It was about 4 oclock. 30 minutes later, the family arrived. We ate and I
got nervous that we should head down soon. I really felt worried about getting
caught in the dark in the semi-technical descent gully. Everyone felt like we
had plenty of time, but I remembered how long descents can take sometimes!

So in the early evening we started down. We put our harnesses and helmets on for
the cable-protected descent. I mandated a "single-clipping" strategy, where only
one carabiner was used. We have to try and be efficient now, it was getting
dark.

But still, we had fun, and I was happy to see that Elijah was okay as long as he
didn't have to walk uphill which really tired him out. Eventually we finished
the technical terrain, then had some fun with a steep and icy snowfield. Kris
did especially well with that.

As we reached the trail of the morning it got almost full dark, and the stars
were out. Elijah was dead beat by the end, and I compounded things by helping
him take off his helmet at the car and pinching his skin painfully. Doh! Finally
it was all too much!

But soon we were in the warm car, driving away in the dark to a warm bed and a
take out pizza for dinner. This was an epic full day for the kids. They did
fantastic, and we made some good memories.

The next day we hung out in a meadow looking across at the Langkofel. Cesar put
the boys through some training paces, and we played a game of baseball with a
pincecone and a log for a bat. It was just me at the boys for that, so they had
to "spawn" copies of themselves to be able to bat and leave players on the
bases!

What a full and fantastic weekend, thanks so much for joining us Cesar!
