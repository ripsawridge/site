### Walk to Kastelruth
_June 13, 2007_

Kris and I rode a lift up from Kastelruth to the Marinzen HÃ¼tte, about 1500
feet above the town. After admiring the goats and playground up there (this
would be a great place for the kids), we wandered down roads and trails back to
the town. We really enjoyed the middle section of the hike, with expansive
meadows and views of towns below. But near the bottom, a thunderstorm broke
loose and we got soaking wet! Fun anyway, as we hardly ever get to hike
together.
