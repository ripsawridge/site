### Company ski-day
_February 24, 2017_

A fun time! I skinned up on my touring skis to the Hoehe Salve summit,
about 1100 meters up from the base at SÃ¶ll. I ran into Yang and Ulan
on the way up, which was fun. Later, at lunch I couldn't find anyone
from the group. Oh well! I decided to spend the afternoon hiking down
and back up from Brixen im Thale. Since I had tennis shoes in my backpack,
I was able to hide my ski gear then walk about 500 meters down a road
and snow-free slopes. I did some meditation in the sun.

After all this, I hurried back, somewhat worried that the lifts would
close before I could make it to the Stocklalm on the north side of the
peak. Happily I just made it! The black runs coming down from the summit
were really excellent -- the snow good _firn_, very much spring conditions
(in the old days).

Hilarious dinner with the team. Lots of funny philosophical discussions.
Always tinged with the absurd, the way I like it best. :)
