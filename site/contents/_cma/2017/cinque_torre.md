## A long weekend in the Cinque Torri

_also posted at <a href="https://medium.com/@ripsawridge/a-long-weekend-in-the-cinque-torre-b824c15de737">Medium</a>..._

Barbara, Chris and I went to Cortina to climb. The weather forecast was rather
depressing. We arrived Friday around 11 in light rain. It was supposed to be
worse on Saturday, then (improbably) fantastic on Sunday. Therefore, we should
try and climb as much as we can today and let Saturday be a day of rest or
swimming or something like that.

We marched up to the rocks and I brazenly started climbing the Torre Lusy
Nordwand in the rain. I made it about 2 meters up and got stuck! Chris and
Barbara looked at me and looked at each other then said, “Uh…I think this won’t
work.” I agreed wholeheartedly, and it took me a little while to carefully get
down! Rain was streaming down the rock into my jacket and underarms. This was
silly, obviously!

New idea — let’s climb the South Summit of the Torre Grande. Mostly very easy
with one IV- pitch near the end. It seemed like the rain was getting lighter,
and we could always reverse the route if necessary.

It took a while to find the route, we went halfway around the rock before I ran
back to our backpacks hidden in a cave to look at the guidebook again. Finally
we were climbing and enjoying ourselves. On pitch two there was a cute little
cave to crawl through. Then we short-roped a couple of pitches up a gully,
across a large block wedged in the crack between the North and South Summits,
then emerged on a ledge on the other side of the peak.

Now we climbed the crux pitch…first traversing to the right on grade III
terrain, then up a delightful chimney with the grade IV- crux. I made a nut
placement that was particularly good — wedging it into a hole to be clipped
from the other side. Barbara found this pitch nerve-wracking because of the
traverse, though Chris showed her good places to put hands and feet. It wasn’t
raining as we climbed this, which was nice!

I scrambled off for the last pitch, a grade III romp up a shallow chimney and
gully. Soon we all stood on the summit, wanting to look around at our
accomplishment through the misty clouds. However, no sooner did we arrive but
the wind picked up, bringing sudden cold and more rain. It was time to get
down, and quickly.

I knew we could abseil the route after down-climbing the last pitch, but there
was an anchor on the summit dropping into the vast gully between the two
summits. With double 50 meter ropes, I was sure we could use it. Down I went,
then Chris then Barbara followed. We stood in a little grotto, somewhat
protected from the wind. I belayed Chris down to an anchor on an enormous block
wedged between the towers. Barbara followed, keeping our spirits up, as we
realized we could become dangerously cold. I was shivering, and told my
partners about how to warm up by swinging your arms and doing squats. That
definitely helped. We rigged the ropes for descent, and I slid down…I found
another wedged boulder that I could swing over too, and briefly contemplated
using an anchor here to reconnect with our ascent route. Barbara and Chris were
getting cold above, so a better choice was to follow the rope to it’s end in
the gully between the towers. This was probably the most fascinating abseil I’d
ever done. Free hanging for 40 meters, a cavalcade of overhanging rock on all
sides, with a thin ribbon of light out to the hills surrounding the Torre.
Shivering somewhat, I freed myself from the rope on a sandy platform and called
up. Chris was soon down, and Barbara whooped with delight at the strangeness of
the orientation in space.

We scrambled down, then made a single-rope rappel to another sandy
continuation. Barbara surprised herself, jumping in an unexpected way on
rappel. She had been warmer than Chris and I on the descent, but now she seemed
colder. I implored her to warm up, and she did. At least now we could laugh a
bit, as we were close to safety…but the serious nature of our predicament was
clear — were we to be immobile up there for longer, we would end up
hypothermic. I castigated myself for getting us so high up in poor weather! Why
not just do single pitch climbs if I insist on climbing in bad weather. Grr.
One long double-rope rappel then got us down. We were on the “Via Finlandia”
side of the mountain. I remembered climbing the beautiful crack of that route
with Aidan 5 years before.

We heartily agreed we’d done enough, and it was time to repair to the hotel in
Pocol, which we did post-haste!

Soon we were laying out our things to dry, and enjoying a hot shower then dry
clothes. Our room was draped in ropes and clinking gear. Chris’s room upstairs
was small so we had some of his things to dry down below. We drove to town for
pizza at Cafe Croda. Ach…delicious!

The next day, Chris decided to hang out around the hotel. Barbara thought he’d
regret it and get bored, but I thought that for a young fella, it’s fun to have
a hotel room and the run of the place for a while. Turns out we were both
right, first me, then Barbara!

Barbara could not keep herself in the place, and was already standing by the
car and getting her harness on while I finished my orange juice! I love the way
she is…

We did the first two pitches of Torre Lusy Nordwand (IV- to here), then I,
suitably chastened from the day before, recommended an abseil to the ground.
The weather was better…although the rock was wet there was sun on east faces.
We went over to Quarta Bassa (III+) and climbed it in three pitches. I vaguely
leaned left as I climbed, hoping to connect to the route to the summit of
Quarta Alta. I saw the start, but was content to take it easy. We enjoyed the
last pitch so much…Barbara did little exercises to climb in harder ways to test
herself. Now she felt fully at home on the rock.

On the descent, Barbara retrieved a stuck rope, doing a much better job than I
had of whipping the rope around creatively to make it come down. “I feel like a
V.I.P.,” she confided, as some wandering hikers saw her equipment and spoke to
her about climbing. I laughed, remembering my own boosts in self-esteem in
similar situations. Yes, climbing can be cold, wet and dangerous at times, but
at times even faint admiration from others can make it seem worthwhile again!

We went back to the car and changed to hiking mode, then wandered up towards
the Nuvolau Rifugio. However, sheets of rain were pouring down on all sides,
and thunder and lightning began ringing around us. We took refuge in the
Scoiattoli Hut after a quick peek down on the west side of the pass, just as
the deluge began.

Inside, we enjoyed a fantastic cappuccino, Barbara raved especially about it.
We were warm and happy…we’d had great fun. And now it was snowing outside!
Barbara made a video. We started quickly down, half-running, reaching the car
in about 20 minutes.

Dinner at Cafe Croda was especially good tonight. We gathered Chris at the
hotel. We remembered my beloved green hiking umbrella which I’d left at the
Cafe the night before. On return, we set up camp in the lobby of the hotel with
a chess board and darts. We had some vodka and orange juice, and more
cappuccino for Barbara (the hotel restaurant stayed open very late).

Chris handily beat me at chess, though I surprised him for a short time before
he lost all respect when I missed a double rook attack on my king. I think I
won against Barbara in an entertaining game where I managed to get my queen
back due to an intrepid and stubborn pawn. Meanwhile, we played darts, keeping
meticulous score on a sheet of paper. Barbara won every time! Such a great
party…

Sunday wasn’t the day we were promised before…in fact, all the surrounding
mountains were covered with fairly thick snow. The sky was a mix of clouds and
sun. At least the sun was warm when it came out. Let’s go!

We packed our things (Barbara and Chris are very efficient at this, earning my
admiration!), sped up to the rock and went right over to Torre Inglese for the
Ostwand (IV-), two pitches which I hoped would be in the sun. The first pitch
was a fantastic chimney/crack which I thought would be very instructive and
enjoyable for Chris and Barbara. From a little notch, we continued up the
second pitch, easier (III) across slabs to a glorious ridge (“Kante”) finish. I
took a bunch of pictures, and a British pair arrived for the climb. The abseils
were awkward and the rope was easily (twice!) stuck in a crack. Once down, we
climbed two single pitch climbs nearby (I don’t have the names for these, but
they were rated III+ and IV+ according to my rough definition).

Chris and I were cold, and he suggested walking over to the lift station and
restaurant nearby. As usual, Barbara didn’t need anything and only reluctantly
left the area of the rock. On the way over we took pictures on the snowy trail.
Once there, we had a fantastic pasta lunch, really overdoing it!

Barbara couldn’t sit still anymore though! I paid and we followed her back out.
Finally, I thought, we are warm enough and enough snow melted that we can climb
what I originally wanted to climb — Torre Lusy Nordwand (IV). We marched over,
and I dispatched the first two pitches as one. Chris and Barbara arrived, and I
was momentarily nervous. I thought the next pitch would be the key as to
whether we could or should continue to the summit and became impatient with
short delays. But then I was off, walking back on a ledge and climbing steeply
to the ridge crest. From here I could see the rest of the route and felt
reassured that we would make it before we froze! Snow on ledges and dramatic
skies gave the experience an alpine air.

In fact, the whole weekend was special because for the first time, Barbara was
experiencing how serious alpine rock climbing could feel in the right
conditions. She loved this, even though Friday had been a bit much. And Chris,
for his first alpine rock, was really getting the full monty. Still smiling,
which was great!

Barbara found the short vertical section on this pitch to be the hardest of the
route. Nonetheless, we continued for pitch 4, which is my favorite. It
traverses over to the edge of the tower, with a dramatic gap across to Torre
Barancio. “I don’t like the gaps!” said Chris at one point, as the exposure was
most deeply felt at this place. The route becomes vertical for a few moves,
too, which was nice. Barbara loved this pitch.

Two more pitches of IV and III, then we were on top. Again,
unable to enjoy it for long, because we were cold. We belayed the short trip
over to the abseil station, then enjoyed the 35-meter free-hanging abseil.

Wonderful!

It was time to pack up and go home, being somewhere after 5 pm. Chris played
some interesting German rap music, and I played Cloud Cult, which my companions
found very weird.

Again, great pleasure was found in the wet and snowy Dolomite mountains. Thank
you Chris, Barbara and thank you Cinque Torre for your hard rock and good
handholds. :) (more pics <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/albums/72157685713007181">here</a>)
