Rowan, Barbara and I hiked up from the parking lot at the Rofan Seilbahn.
Soon we were at the Mauritzalm. Rowan went to get a Spezi and a snack
at the restaurant, and was captured by the free WiFi.

Barbara and I persevered, and hiked down and up on the *Grubastieg* trail
for a few minutes until reaching our crag, imaginatively named
"Grubastiege." We climbed:

  * "Robin Hood" - 4a - On the left side, it follows a prow of rock with
    good handholds.
  * "Goofy" - 6a - Leads to the same anchor. This route has some slab climbing
    that makes it a bit trickier. I think it's over-rated (I'd call it 5b).
  * "Spider Man" - 6b - Herrlich! Such an enjoyable start, traversing
    carefully up and to the right, finally moving back left where the way
    becomes easier thanks to a *Wasserrille* for hands and feet.
  * "Pinocchio" - 5c - Also very good, but with a sketchy move at the base
    of the twin *Wasserrillen* that mark the upper half of the route.
    Barbara figured this one out: move gently right at this point and use
    a hole in the rock for a foot. A good tiny hold on the slab gets you
    high enough to reach the better hand-holds in the *Wasserrille*.

We met and climbed with
a fantastic mom and daughter from LÃ¼beck. Way in the north, where
mountains are far...they reminded me that the mountains were once just
a dream for me, living in a flat, hot plain. I'm happy to be here -- but I'm
also happy for that time of longing, because it lifted the mountains to
a higher plane. Yes, they are my sports hall, but they are also something
much more. They represent the highest aspirations.

So it can be good to be far from what you love!

At any rate, we enjoyed these routes a lot. I was especially impressed that
Barbara got up "Spider Man" perfectly. And then did it again. And her solution
to the problem of "Pinocchio" was a stylistic improvement on my somewhat
*heikel* lead style.

Well worked out, we went to get Rowan and all hiked down fairly quickly.
We drove home by Tegernsee, Barbara wishing for a towel in the car so she
could jump in. Arme!

Thanks Rowan, thanks Barbara, and thanks Rofangebirge!
