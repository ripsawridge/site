### Bike riding around Santa Rosa
<i>October, 2012</i>

My brother runs a neat bike rental shop, <a
href="https://www.uber-bike.com/">uber-bike.com</a>, and he took me for a few
hours on high-end bikes around the hills of Santa Rosa. I had a lot of trouble
with the technical "lock-in" foot pedals at times, but it was a lot of fun!
