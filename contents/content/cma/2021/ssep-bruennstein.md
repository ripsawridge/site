Barbara and I hiked up to the Brünnstein Hütte, 2 days after lovely Mara
passed away. Barbara missed her so greatly. There was a couple there with
a little dog named Vanilia. She was so happy to be allowed to watch this
little dog for a few minutes. We had a nice conversation with the couple,
then went down a different way, leaving the summit climb for next time.
