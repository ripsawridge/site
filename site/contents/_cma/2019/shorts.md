### Kranzhorn

_April 14, 2019_

Quick hike up Kranzhorn. I found a neat variation near the end, following a steep ridge to cliffs below the
summit. Hurried down, now my legs are sore!

### Vorderkaiserfeldenh√ºtte ###

_April 6, 2019_

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up the steep Oberndorfer Weg to the hut for a drink. It was about 1100 meters
from the Inn valley floor. Really interesting trail...had to carry Mara at one point up some steep
Klettersteig stairs.

### Kranzhorn ###

_March 23, 2019_

Barbara and I (along with little Mara) hiked up from the Inn. A bit of snow near the top was
fun. Here is a fun video of Barbara hiking [in the snow](https://photos.app.goo.gl/j2Z9tnY3VTvFisYN7).

### Wallberg

_January 27, 2019_

A snowshow hike up the old ski way on Wallberg. With somewhat elevated
avalanche danger I decided to go whole hog and take my transceiver,
shovel and pole. Very nice ascent...I had a distinct advantage over the
few skiers out on the very steep section in the lower third of the hike.
Never saw those cats again!

A few pics...

Looking to the fun-plex where I'll get some lunch.
