Timo and I suddenly had the day to climb! So we did.

First up was "[Maxl's Gamsrevier (7-)](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/tirol/karwendel/maxls-gamsrevier)."
I'd never managed to get the 7- move on this climb clean and today was unfortunately
no exception! Boy...maybe one day...

Timo led the 6+ pitch three, and I did manage to get that move...a very interesting
shallow corner where you stand up holding your breath. Well...I did at least!

We hiked up a bit to the left to reach "[Maxl's Krone (7-)](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/tirol/karwendel/maxls-krone),"
a definite highlight of the day. Every pitch on this climb is interesting!
Timo dispatched the steep but juggy 5+ first pitch.

The next pitch was similar, on a shallow pillar rising from the face.
It was grade 5, but I thought it was about as hard as the first pitch.

Pitch three was really interesting. There was a long reach for a jug at
mid-height which nearly didn't work. Then higher, it has delicate moves
in a shallow corner with generally poor hands. I liked it a lot!

The fourth pitch at grade 7- was a tour-de-force. First easy slab climbing, then
you gradually work into a vertical channel, with just the bare minimum of
small hand and footholds where you need them. I deeply enjoyed the opportunity
to concentrate hard here.

The last pitch had a hard grade 6 move off the belay, then rapidly became easier.
Strong wind kept things interesting though, at one point I nearly blew over!

Timo and I made the long hike down from the upper wall, first belaying down for one
pitch from the end of the route. I'd forgotten how steep that area was, only remembering
it as a "walk off." 

We got back to our packs, drank some water and ate some food.
Our finale would be "[Kaiser Max Spätlese (6+)](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/tirol/karwendel/kaiser-max-spaetlese)." 
Vaclav and I had done this climb only two weeks before,
enjoying it very much. But I'd cheated at the 6+ crux. This time I was determined
to get it clean.

As usual in the lazy afternoon heat, it was hard to get going. Timo led the
first pitch, which is steep but not difficult (5). I did the interesting
grade 6 traverse moves right above his head on pitch two. The 5- and 5
pitches that followed went without incident...frankly, we were tired!

Timo led the next two, which first lean to the left, then execute an interesting
downward traverse (4+, 4+).

I headed out for the last pitch, and really enjoyed getting the crux clean.
I executed a traverse below the bolt on the slab, finding it quite sketchy to
reach a small hold up and left of the bolt. I realized there is probably a 
better way, by staying right of the bolt until you can use a little pocket
for a finger above. No matter...my way was highly interesting!

Thanks to Timo and the good weather for lots of fun! It was great to catch up,
it had been years since we'd been able to climb together...
