Originally uploaded by [ripsaw ridge](http://www.flickr.com/people/ripsawridge/) I'm happy to report that finally, after two years of effort, ski touring
has entered my blood. I can ski well enough now that I hardly ever fall
down in a tangle of arms and legs. I do my share of "kick turning," which
means my descents aren't as joyful as those of a real skier. But I've found
a sweet spot with it. There are just so many places to ski tour here, an
endless supply of mountains. And I get to see so much more of the Winter
Alps than I ever saw of the Winter Cascades. Adding up the ski tours (and
occasional snowshoe tour, which I still like), I have been able to do considerably
more "hiking" in the winter here than back in the U.S..
  
  
Ski touring is way, way more rewarding than going to a lift area. The
few times I went this year were marred by snow-making machinery and icy
slopes.
  
  
This is a picture I took from the Silvrettahorn, in the RÃ¤tikon Alps on
the Swiss/Austrian border. I love the party of 5 people traveling on the
ridge top. And I love the steep, pointy mountain across the valley.
