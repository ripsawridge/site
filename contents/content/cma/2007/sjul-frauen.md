### Fraunwasser climbing
_July 17, 2007_

Uli and I went for some morning climbing. I was still tired from the
Grossglockner climb Sunday, so I had no confidence at all on the deceptively
steep slabs. Of course I made it worse by picking a hard line of 3 grade 6
pitches to start with ;-). At virtually every crux I had to stop and rest on
the rope. On the second pitch I was scared to go for the third bolt which
committed me to climbing over a roof. I said I would lower off, then somehow
got the guts to go for it. But I really like the roof because it has big holds
above...last time with Daniel I avoided it off to the left. 

So it was a somewhat frustrating morning, but probably good for me to work
through the uncertain feelings. Uli set a record for the hardest climbs he's
done outdoors.
