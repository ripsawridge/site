Change of plan



The weather was amazing, and somehow I couldn't find a partner for the
mountains. Also, Kris needed the car to take the boys to a summertime
weightlifting comp. Finally, a late night Friday with a couple of grillfests
meant I woke up Saturday morning unprepared to use the beautiful weekend.

But these problems can be solved! I decided to climb the Blassengrat to the
Jubilaeumsgrat bivouac hut, then continue to the Zugspitze summit the next
day. I brought a helmet and rock shoes, two days of food, and regular hiking
equipment. On the train to Garmisch, I realized I should have at least brought
an ice axe as well, nevermind crampons. Oh well.

It was already brutally hot as I walked from the train station to
Hammersbach. I'd had some interesting conversations the night before with Janina
and her roommate, talking about things like the status of women through history,
"Adam Smithian" economics, how interesting the nuances of just the right words
are, pre-history. Another of Janinas friends specializes in creating authentic
clothing and jewelry from early Christian and Pagan times. All really cool
stuff!

I walked to the mountains and lost patience with my cleaving to man-made
installations in order to bring my trip across. I was going to pay for a lift to
eliminate much hiking, I was going to seek out a shelter, possibly cramped with
coughing, begrudging people? No, I thought!

On the hot and steaming road, I saw the Zwölferkopf shimmering high above,
directly before me. I had climbed it once before with a friend, Alexander. But
we fought with hail and lightning on the summit, and getting down was fraught
with danger on the wet rocks and slick grassy slopes.

Now I had a chance to climb it again and get a proper view. Where would I sleep?
What do I care! Perhaps I'll follow the ridge all the way to the
Riffelscharte. I remembered Georgs description of that trip, he seemed to
shudder as he described the stressful and endless towers of loose rock. Or maybe
not. It would be many hours before I'd have to decide that.

But the point is that the decision to "not care" about sleeping was very
liberating. I had enough food, I only had to take every chance I could find to
drink as much water as possible, because there would be none above the last
trees. I refilled my water from the river at Hammersbach, among the milling
tourists. I hiked up 
listening to a [Loreena McKennitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfAuX5kJOl8) 
song about a highwayman,
again a reminder of conversations yesterday ("_what is the term for a robber on
the road?_"). Weirdly, at this moment a black snake slithered across the path
right in front of me.

There should be a name for the state of mind when concurrences and coincidences
pile up rather pleasingly in the mind. And all this combined with an adventurous
undertaking that quickens the blood at the same time. I was in a liminal state,
halfway between worlds. So for example, I decided that the black snake was
significant, but felt free at the same time to interpret the meaning
creatively. To me, it meant I was crossing a boundary, and the occasion was
ominous only in the sense that all border crossings contain seeds of danger. But
I was going to cross, and I thanked the snake for reminding me to be cautious.

So in this free-wheeling state, I made my way up trails and roads to the hidden
_Selbstversorghütte_ (self-service cabin) in the woods below the
Zwölferkopf. There are no signs, perhaps because people would show up and
querulously ask for beer. Eventually I managed to get there.

_"Ist jemand zu Hause?"_ I called out. It's polite not to approach a hut too directly. A man
appeared between hanging clothes. 

_"Gibt es noch Wasser im Quelle?"_

He explained that yes, there was water and it was only a couple of minutes down
the hill.

Yes! Had the spring been dry, my plan would be in serious trouble. I needed a
LOT of water on what felt like the hottest day of the year. I drank a couple of
liters, and headed out again, waterlogged. Before long I was scratching up
desert-like scree slopes finding the best purchase in places with a faint
footstep. Strange rotten bags of dirt dotted the slope, each spilled open and
blackened. Finally I realized they must have been part of a nighttime exhibit in
which the slope was lit up was fire. They were meant to light and burn
harmlessly in place. How many years ago had that been?

The Eibsee


I entered the stony cirque between the Manndl and the Zwölferkopf, kicking
steps up a snowfield to change into rock shoes at the Gedankentafel marking a
long-ago death. I carefully climbed the rotten rock...no mistakes allowed!

A brief comment about soloing in alpine terrain.

Soloing terrain like this might seem crazy, but as the veteran of hundreds of
climbs with partners and alone, it's clear that in the loose and protectionless
terrain before or after the "meat" of a rock climb, there is not much a rope can
do. In these situations usually it just slows the party down and worse, knocks
rocks off onto the second climber. In the case of a fall, it's likely that the
leader has no protection in place, or protection that would likely fail. In the
absolute best case, the rope can mean the difference between the hospital and
the grave. But in the average case in this terrain, there is no difference.

The rope rises in value in proportion to the protectability of the
terrain. Therefore, whether you are alone or with a partner on such
terrain...you are alone, and you may as well realize it early.

More dawn



It took some time to find the start of the route, even though I'd been here in 2010. I 
climbed the first pitch slowly, mindful of the danger of a wrong
turn. Pitch two had a couple harder moves (IV), but they were joyful to climb
because the rock turned strong and clean. In fact I got into trouble here
because the climbing was so nice. I sped past the third belay, and ended up
confused at the fourth belay station, wondering if I should go left to the ridge
crest or continue for another 50 meters on a great tilted face. Both looked
reasonable, which is kind of a problem! I cursed that I didn't remember this
spot from 4 years ago. My own rule in soloing is that you can't venture more
than 10 or 15 meters from a known point into unknown terrain, and that you have
to absolutely be able to downclimb everything in that state. I had to check out
the right option carefully now, so I ventured over and tried three chimneys in
turn. Each proved to be harder than the grade III climbing I expected, and there
was an "unclimbed" quality to the rock. Usually, there are subtle signs that
people have been by. A slight wear on important holds, a reduction in loose
rock, a lack of black lichen on the rock, a lack of wet, muddy vegetation
peeking out from cracks.

After 20 minutes or so, I was sure: this was not the way.

Later, following the ramp left to the ridge crest I was very happy in my
choice. Had I climbed up one of those chimneys I would have ended up below
vertical faces that remained loose and scruffy. Whew!

Now on the crest, everything looked better. 3 easy pitches followed on solid
rock with tufts of grass. I had heard voices before, and I saw their
owners...two guys dealing with the grade IV cracks on the crest. I climbed up,
met them for a friendly exchange of banter, and climbed through for some
excellent crack climbing with good hand jams.

The glacier and summit beyond.



I thought the crux of the route was the small overhang that began the
"Badplatten." A couple of poor footholds, and some ungainly heaving got me onto
the slab, where I rested a few minutes. One of the guys below came up and
remarked that he thought that move was grade V- or so! More clean climbing got
me into the great gully that marks the last easy pitches. Starting to feel
tired, I reached the summit under a broiling sun. The feeling of pleasant
intersection with subjective interpretation of reality had been burned away by
the demands of constant focus on what was in front of me. It wouldn't be until
night that I regained that feeling, but even then only to a degree.

But that's okay. Intense concentration is it's own reward.

Now I looked across to the Grosser Waxensteinturm. Could I traverse the ridge
over there? It looked like there would be climbing moves. I wished for the
guidebook with a description. I decided it would be a bit foolhardy to just try
and get over there without knowing at least something. Oh well, so much for
"perfect freedom!" So I hiked down the rather unnerving trail to the
Mittagsscharte. I followed the tedious ups and downs of the Schafsteig to the
junction with the route down to the valley, then continued on to the route back
up to the Grosser Waxensteinturm. I left my pack here and climbed the
entertaining route to the summit. It goes right up a polished stone watercourse,
sometimes with some real climbing moves. Some pitons and bolts were present at
harder spots.

A nice view from the summit, but also the realization that I was pretty
tired. The heat of the day had an exhausting effect. I climbed down, got my pack
and continued the long journey on the Schafsteig. Now I met many _Gämse_
(mountain deer), who kind of wheezed at me as I went by. The sun gradually
dropped behind the mountain walls, and I dropped into the valley. Far below I
saw a grassy slope with sheep and a waterfall. I was incredibly thirsty, having
finished my last water an hour before. I'd need to go as far down into the
valley as necessary to get water.

One interesting difference between a granitic mountain range and a limestone
range seems to be that water sources in the latter disappear more quickly in
summer. My thought is that the rock is porous, and water sources have more
opportunities to disappear from sight much sooner.

A gaggle of climbers



Finally I reached the sheep and a fairly protected water source. I drank two
liters greedily, then took another liter down the valley to the first flat
grassy spot with a little bit of wind protection. Now it was almost fully
dark. I settled down on my pack, arranged it's contents around me as wind
protection. I had my rock shoes for a pillow, a light down jacket as a "sleeping
bag" and a windproof jacket as a "blanket." I ate two peanut butter sandwiches
and put some Landjaeger sausage in my jacket to warm up for later. Around
midnight that sausage was delicious!

Sausage, like cheese and chocolate, can't be eaten cold.

I slept now and then, woke up shivering, thought about life, looked at the
stars, then slept a little more. I enjoyed myself a lot. Some famous mountaineer
said that a night out was psychologically an important part of adventure, and
much as I usually try to avoid it, I have to agree. I played the thousands of
feet and hundreds of holds and positions over in my head. I imagined taking
different paths. I stretched all the sore muscles, which felt good. I shivered
some more, and watched the moon across my arc of sky.

I woke up at around 4 am as a light swept across me. Crunching footsteps, and a
man stood before me. "Is this the trail?" he said in English. 

"No, you just stepped off it, back to the right!"

"Thanks!" he said, and crunched away. Who was he? Where was he going at this
strange hour? It was especially odd that he was traveling down valley and not
up. I sat up and watched the dawn.

Near the summit



At 5 am I started to walk, stiffly. Three men appeared, and I sent them ahead
because I planned to move slowly. The pilgrimage to the Zugspitze summit had
begun, now in deep pink and orange light from the rising sun. I hiked up the
trail and cables uneventfully, mind rather cotton-encased. I passed the men, a
father and two sons when they stopped to eat second breakfast. Later, on the
glacier I ran into trouble. I had to cross rock-hard smooth water ice to get to
some steps melted and bashed into the slope from previous parties. I tried all
around the area, using rocks and my ski poles to make a step. But it was too
hard.

The three men came up and I asked if they had anything to help, maybe an ice
axe. Or worst case, I thought that if one of them stood in the bottom bashed
step, I could grab their ankles and do a funny kind of lying down pull-up to
reach that step!

But instead they decided one of them would take off his in-step crampons above
the difficulty and toss them down for me to wear. That was really nice! And it
worked perfectly! I was happy for several reasons, including general
"comradeship in the mountains." They could have easily told me how irresponsible
I was to be there and what happens if, etc. etc.

Together we crossed the glacier and found the entrance, using the higher one
because the lower entrance had an impossible moat to cross. I returned the
crampons and headed off, getting some nice pictures of them later.

The nice climbing in the sun here was fantastic. But by the time I reached the
final slope, I was dead tired. I mentally abandoned the plan to hike down the
Stopselsteig, and go ahead and give in to the mechanical world. On top I chatted
with a family from Seattle, then shared a beer and breakfast with Eberhardt and
his sons. One of them knew Stuart Hardy, who I only know by reputation, having
climbed many of the routes he set in the Thalkirchen climbing gym.

The adventure ends here, the rest is a weary procession of lifts and trains to
get home. It was a 25 hour adventure, with 3500 meters of elevation gain and 12
pitches of technical climbing. What fun! I came home, intending to play with the
kids and just crashed after a shower!
