<h3>Silver Peak, October 24, 2003</h3>

Carlos and I parked on the road below Silver Peak, where the PCT crosses. We hiked up the trail
for a climb of Silver Peak, but started to worry that we missed our turnoff onto a "faint" trail
leading to the summit. We decided to "give up" on the trail, and bushwhack our way up a cliff
band and brush instead. This felt like a pretty crazy idea for a quick morning hike, but we
were curious about how we'd do. Right away we scrambled on steep and muddy broken cliffs, making
liberal use of brush handholds. We were on a sort of ridge with alternating steps of cliff and
brushy level sections. After about 30 minutes, we came to a streambed that led into a wonderful

 on the east side of the peak. We admired the sunrise on nearby peaks, and
walked up talus and heather slopes to a weakness in the cliffs that ringed the basin. There
were a

few moves of 5.0 rock climbing</a> on solid rock. I would make a move, then wait for Carlos to
finish it. After this excitement, we connected with the regular trail on the ridge, and followed it
to <a href="/cmaimages/2003/carlossum.jpg">the summit</a>. 
There was a great panorama all around, and our unusual ascent route added to the
fun of the morning. We had to get back to start the workday, so we rambled down the trail.
We found that we should have kept walking another 10 minutes to find it on the way up, but we
enjoyed our unusual climbing route. Into the car and off to work!
