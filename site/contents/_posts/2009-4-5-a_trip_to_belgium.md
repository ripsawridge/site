So I just had my first week of work at my new company, Advanced Medical
Diagnostics. I flew up to Brussels early Monday morning, and came home
Friday night. I was lucky that there was a training on use of the HistoScanning
device Monday, and then a great dinner at a local restaurant that night
which gave me more insight into the company.
  
  
In between asking lots of questions to set up my machines, get passwords,
etc., I even managed to help out with some .NET memory management questions
and SOS/Windbg debugging. Maybe one of the bigger accomplishments of the
week was refreshing my brain on the whole gamut of minutiae involved in
that work from the CLR days. It's cool to be a customer of .NET technology
now!

The weather in Belgium was amazing. The office is in Waterloo, a suburb
of Brussels and the site of Napoleon's famous defeat 200 years ago. I went
for a jog one evening, cutting across fields just outside of town on bike
trails. The land slopes gently at times. There was a great sunset, surprisingly
late. I couldn't be sure, but it looked like clouds were coming back in
as I left Friday night, after 5 days of blue skies.
  
  
The people at the company are really friendly folks too, I'm looking forward
to getting to know them. Oh yeah, Wolfgang and I went to a climbing gym
Thursday night. The grades were French, so I didn't really know what I
was climbing. The hardest were a couple of 6a climbs. Enjoyed lots of great
food too: an Ethiopian food place and an Indian food restaurant in Wolfgang's
neighborhood were the best. Wolfgang also took me on an evening tour of
the city, including the famous [Manneken Pis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manneken_Pis).
I bought some chocolate, but not the best...too sweet.
  
  
This next week will be working from home. I've already got a handful of
projects, but so much more to learn too.
  
  
Next time: gotta try Belgian Waffles!
