B. and I were together for 9 years. We had so many laughs, and talks, and
so many ways of feeling the love between us. She brought me ever more into
myself. I hope I gave her the same in return.

That phrase "the end is present in the beginning" comes to me. A phrase like
that only makes sense once the end has come and gone. It makes sense to
me now, though I hid from it with all kinds of bluster and plans. It shouldn't
be so complicated, I would think. Another phrase: "anything worth doing is
worth doing badly," which must also apply.

This photo, taken last November in Italy...it shows the last warm light of
sun on trees already golden, knowing that winter approaches, knowing that they
have given all their gifts back to Father Sun by turning golden in response
to His gift to them.

There is no House that is a Home for us to share. There are Homes, but
they aren't mine. I am glad there are Homes. I love the idea of a home.
I see a horse wandering through his paddock in the twilight, sitting here on
my friends porch. I wonder if he feels he is at home. I hope so!
