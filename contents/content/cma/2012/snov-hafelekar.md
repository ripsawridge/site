### Hafelekar
<i>November, 2012</i>

I hiked from downtown Innsbruck (the parking lot for the futuristic train that
can take you up to Hungerburg. I thought I'd get a feeling for what it was like
for Hermann Buhl as a kid, hiking up here from town every chance he got. At
1800 meters elevation gain and loss, it sure felt like a long way! Enjoyed some
good pipe smoke at the Bodensteinalm on the descent, and good conversation with
some Innsbruckers. They told me about bears in the local mountains (really!).
