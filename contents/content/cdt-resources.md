My detailed reports are on this site and can be read straight through starting with
[Mexican Border to Lordsburg](http://localhost:7878/cma/2022/border-lordsburg.html).
In 2022, I hiked **northbound** (NOBO), and in 2023 I hiked **southbound** (SOBO).
I conclude quite easily that **southbound is better** because of snow.

According to
my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Mi2E7xrl3UTxb4hViwQV68YnKkyp72dQRCDqddYs1c/edit?usp=sharing),
I hiked **2,400.6 miles** and climbed **384,698 feet**.
That's like climbing Mount Everest from the ocean 13 times.

I recorded **162 days** for the journey, including rest days, but not including the
season away from the trail between the summer of 2022 and 2023. This adds up to
about **5.5 months**.

My hike of the trail is **disqualified** from being a "true" or "complete" hike
of the CDT for two reasons:

1. There are gaps. In New Mexico a 2 mile gap due to fire. In Colorado a similar sized
   gap at Silverton, and a 13 mile gap north of i-70 initially due to injury. In Wyoming a gap of nearly 20 miles near Dubois because of
   bear activity. In Montarna, a gap of ~10 miles due to closure of the CDT south
   of Helena. In the latter two large gaps, if I'm being honest, I could have tried
   to minimize them somewhat **but I didn't**. Oh, one more gap when Robert drove
   us to a trailhead outside of Big Sky, probably 4 miles.
2. We did the **Big Sky Variant** also called the **Butte Super-cutoff** which
   saves 2 weeks of hiking along the Montana/Idaho border. It was sometimes
   interesting, including the only "technical mountaineering" of the trail, but
   it is so far from the official route and saves so much time that it shouldn't
   be considered the CDT.

Nonetheless, I'm happy with the effort. I traveled mostly alone in 2022, but
spent some great days with [Lemonhope](/friends/Lemonhope), [Mishap](/friends/Mishap) and [Gargoyle](/friends/Gargoyle). For
2023, most of the hiking was with [Cory](/friends/Cory), the rest alone.

I only saw one grizzly bear, quite close but uninterested in us. I saw moose,
elk, deer, snakes (including rattlesnakes), beaver, marmots, squirrels, foxes,
owls, toads, road-runners, rabbits, javelinas, pikas, ptarmigans, bald eagles and hawks. I learned that horseflies are worse than mosquitoes,
and that bees are quite friendly.
