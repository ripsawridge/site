### Kramerspitz Traverse
<i>October 15, 2011</i>

After a late afternoon nap I drove out to Garmisch and hiked up Kramerspitz. I
had a small water bottle, headlamp, jacket and gloves. It took about 2 hours to
get up past the hut and the Kanzel lookout over Garmisch. There were a few snow
patches. I always forget how much up and down there is along the ridge. I got
to the top, stumbling in darkness, as I stubbornly didn't want to use my
headlamp until the descent.

Beautiful view of city lights and the Zugspitze in growing moonlight. I hiked
down to the south, then made the long flat walk back to the car. 4:15 round
trip, 1400 meters elevation gain/loss.
