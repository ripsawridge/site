On the summit scramble



Danno and I had a day to hike, though we almost missed out. First off, I was
away for so long on Saturday that we didn't sync up. Sunday morning at 7 I
called Danno to work out a trip. We would meet in Holzkirchen to carpool out to
Gschnitz in the Stubai for a climb of Habicht, which was in perfect shape.

Alas! A terrible traffic jam followed. It was well after nine when we left
Holzkirchen. We were hiking sometime after 11 am, a rather ridiculous time to
start for such a long hike, but oh well.

We had some entertaining talks about the state of the world. And hilariously, I
tried to get Danno to carry less gear, as usual, and he fought tenaciously to
keep his small supply of fruit and candy bars as usual. "But the hut is open!" I
protested. "Let's just eat there!"

It was a pretty warm and sweaty hike up over 1000 meters just to reach the
hut. I risked a sunburn by going shirtless, but the air felt good. We rounded a
corner to see the shuttered hut, realizing indeed that we wouldn't get
lunch. The bigger problem was a lack of water. Some descending hikers gave us
half a liter, which was super nice.

Heading home



Nursing the disappointment from a lack of lunch, we huffed and puffed up onto a
shoulder of the mountain. A descending hiker made a point to let us know we were
irresponsibly late in this area, tapping his watch and wagging his finger
unctiously. Thank you, sir.

Before long we crossed a gable to enter the southern flank. An entertaining
scramble followed, occasionally protected by unnecessary cables. It was nice and
warm, the sun felt good and the clear air made for stunning views. Danno was
pretty tired, and even if I had some residual energy, it was clear we'd end up
scrambling down in the dark if we pressed forward. So we found a high point on
the ridge 400 meters below the summit, where the scramble trail heads off to
another ridge for the climb to the glacier.

It was good to be here. We could see from the Karwendel to Italy, with the
Hochferner over in the Zillertal looking especially impressive. After hanging
out a while, we hiked down pretty quickly, stopping for a delicious apple and a
candy bar at a pass near the hut. The final march to the car was a bit of a
slog, but it was nice to see the evening shadows growing in this beautiful
valley.

Alas! Again traffic bedeviled us. Why, God, why?! A couple of hungry guys
finally limped home to scrounge for food in their respective houses. Thanks
Danno for the day!
