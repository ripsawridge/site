Kannst Du Barbara finden?




Rare and wonderful event: Barbara and I both had a full weekend, and good,
dry weather was in the forecast. Of course, we had to use it. As usual,
I waited until Thursday to hone in on a destination. I found a climb on
the Hohes Brett, a broad peak rising on the east side of Berchtesgaden.
It was called 
["Sommer, Sonne, Sonnenschein,"](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/bayern/berchtesgadener-alpen/sommer-sonne-sonnenschein-hohes-brett)
and rated IV. Of medium-long
length at 8 pitches, it was perfect for us. I found a hotel in Berchtesgaden,
and with that our trip was set. I'd wait until Saturday night to figure out
what to do Sunday, based on how we felt and what was available nearby.

Barbara joked with me in the days before. "How about you come at eight in the
morning and we leave?" she texted me, knowing that I would find that unacceptably
late. Happily she wasn't there to see me sputter and fume. Bringing myself
under control with some difficulty, I replied lightly, "Hmm, perhaps that's a
bit late, seven would be better." She indicated that would work. Score one for
not flying off the handle!

A couple hours later, we were hiking up from the Hinterbrand parking lot,
talking sometimes, walking quietly at other times. We reached Mitterkaseralm,
though I thought it was higher. A nice fella at the alm, which is currently
a big construction site pointed out that we were walking right through an
"Aufbau," and pointed at the crane spinning above our heads. Oh!

We hiked about 30 more minutes up, and realized that we'd taken a wrong turn.
We should have turned left up a forested slope above the construction site
to reach the broad Southwest Wall of the peak. Now we were below the South
Face. Shucks! I was apologetic and feeling we'd wasted time and energy, but
Barbara brought me back to the larger point: "The goal is a fun weekend,
and the hiking is part of it. It doesn't make sense to declare a part of the
hiking is 'bad.' It's all good!"

We are here

Hi again, you



Oh! She knows things.

So, back down, and then up again on the other side of a short but popular
climbing cliff. After a rest, we began traversing underneath our wall, finding
the route easily. We were a bit tired...we didn't get much sleep the night
before, and we hadn't done many hikes with packs lately. Soon Barbara sent me
off on the first pitch, an easy III-. Pitch two had a really nice little move
at IV- in a chimney/corner. On the third pitch, unfortunately a party on another
route above knocked off some rocks and Barbara got hit in the arm. Grr. But soon
she was safely ensconsced in a nook below that wall and safe from further
predations. A bit more effort got us to the upper half of the route, where
the climbing got more interesting.

An excellent grade IV pitch led up and out of a "Kessel" (cauldron) in steep
cracks. We liked this a lot. A grade III- pitch followed, and Barbara
led it, overjoyed when she found one of the two or three bolts on the long
pitch. It was so funny to hear her happy cries above.

Pitch eight was again IV, on a "Rillenplatte," or a slab with runnels formed by
water over thousands of years. Had we begun building civilizations when they
were first visible? That would be "only" 5000 years ago, and I suppose that's
nothing to the rock face here. Long it stood, "as if waiting for us to find it
enjoyable to climb," I quipped to Barbara.

Hello, süße



Really, a most excellent pitch, with a vertical section after the slab that I thought
Barbara would find challenging, but no, she came up easily. The last pitch
at IV- was equally interesting. Short and steep walls with grippy rock. The 
very air had become golden with the descending sun. Barbara arrived, and gave me
a kiss.

Have I said that I want more?

Because if I did I was wrong.

A great, long pitch (4/4-)

These are the colors



Now we hiked up in "Golden Hour" light, happy to wear shoes again. We reached the
Jägerkreuz, then started down a cable-protected path. Barbara slipped in the snow,
getting her pants wet which is no fun! But we had a long ways to go -- plenty of
time for them to dry! We walked down for ages on a steep trail dropping south and
curving west. We saw an enticing view into the Bluntautal, with forests and little
houses. Then we took a short cut down to Mitterkaseralm, eventually reaching
our point of the morning where we turned back from that trail. Gämse watched us
warily from slopes above. Here, we found some water...we were extremely thirsty.

Down to Hinterbrand, pretty worked out! We just made it before needing a headlamp.

In town we found an Italian restaurant and pigged out on pizza, Caprezzi salad and
red wine. What a day!

Guten Morgen, Schätzi!



At a fantastic breakfast, we honed in on the possibilities for the day. The route
"[Jubiläumsweg](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/bayern/berchtesgadener-alpen/jubilaeumsweg-hoher-goell)" on the Hoher Göll looked interesting, though maybe too hard.
It had a short approach, and the other possibility was the
"[Alte Westwand](http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/bayern/berchtesgadener-alpen/alte-westwand-hoher-goell),"
which at III+ would be too easy, though we'd get practice travelling in coils and
simul-climbing, which is always useful.

Soon we were hiking up, having a wonderful conversation about how Earth is always
our mother, and the Sun is our father. Barbara pushed back on me about too much
philosophy, but I stuck to my point. Every single thing that grows comes from the
combination of energy from the sun and nurturing of the earth, even her and I.
"Your mother's womb nurtured you, even as she grew a strong body to hold you
on the energy of the sun."

"No! I came from my dad's cum!" she said, trying to shock me and bring me back
to earth.

Laughing, I said "yes, you did! But where was that material grown? Your father's mother
is the Earth."

Lots of easy terrain



Again, no! We continued like this, enjoying ourselves. I got an idea.

"Look at these dead leaves on the ground. There are so many...to us, their mother was the
tree, but think how remote she must have seemed to the leaves. They come along fresh
every year, grow and fall, though mother remains standing tall and impossibly high."

"They lived a bold and good life, though now we are surrounded by their bodies. And as
they age and prepare to fall, they are so beautiful. They give us this 'Golden Time'
that we love so much."

"Is the earth not tired at the end of the day? Doesn't it feel the way we do? Fully
worked...but happy and satisfied with the effort?"

The first of many abseils...



Barbara understood what I meant. But she guards against wandering into deep weeds of
useless mental play with a fierce commitment to right here and now. She won't go one
step down a path that she doesn't feel fully. I can't express how valuable I find
this to be...

---

Along the way, we kept stopping to hug and kiss. We would part from our embrace, both
dizzy with feeling. At our "high age" we've finally learned to follow our noses into
greater feeling, greater grips with life. We keep finding each other there.

See you soon!

Goodbye, Hoher Göll



At this point, we were like a beach continually washed by waves of peace and love
(srsly, I'm not exaggerating :)), so any climbing we did would just be extra bonus
on top. Barbara traversed into the face, and I led up the first pitch behind a party of
three moving quickly. However, on reaching the grade V slab in the second half of the
pitch I felt wrong. Actually, the climbing made me nervous, and I thought about how
Barbara would feel. Grr. I climbed back down, somewhat frustrated. Barbara consoled me
and we switched gears to climb the Alte Westwand instead. We traveled with about 10 meters
of rope between us, clipping into protection or putting the occasional sling in place.
At some point on a left-leaning ramp it was hard enough for a belay. Then we continued
in coils all the way to the middle part of the wall, having caught up to the other
party.

In here, Barbara slipped on easy terrain (she is mad at herself about this, but I think
it's a good reminder that even simple terrain can be serious) and I felt her pull on the
rope. Due to the nature of the terrain, I held her weight easily. We kept going, the only
injury being a cut on her pinky. She was getting hammered this weekend!

The upper part of the route was more dramatic, with big walls all around. There was an
excellent pitch escaping from a Kessel on the left side, then we were below the final
chimney. This was the best pitch of the route, and quite intimidating for the grade of
III+. Suddenly, you are in a cold, air-conditioned chimney with runnels of water and smooth
walls for hands and feet. But several bolts protect the way, and it was just plain
enjoyable.

We only had a few minutes to sit, then we wanted to get out of the hot sun. With a single
60 meter rope, I thought the rappels would be interesting in a minor way. But it was unsettling
to see that the pitch lengths were not accurate (the Panico guidebook), so even though
we could rappel 30 meters at a time, we found ourselves in "rope stretcher" situations
on pitches that were supposed to be only 20 meters. I guessed that there was simply no
strong check on pitch lengths because most parties use double ropes.

Finally we connected with the abseil route in the middle of the wall, but then promptly
ran into trouble. I couldn't find the anchor, and I was out of rope. There was a strange
cave-like formation, and I saw a couple single bolts in the area, but I wasn't near an anchor.
So I went to the left where a solid horn of rock and a ledge looked better. I had to
leave a sling and carabiner, but at least I could see our ascent route below, and knew
we could just downclimb that once we reached it.

This deviation from the norm made Barbara a little nervous, but this is also good training!
She felt and feels everything, and her mental state reflects what we feel. This is mostly
great and good for us, but the downside is that she can feel uncertain on terrain that
she marched confidently up earlier. How to balance and use the way you feel with the
way things really are? It's kind of the work of a lifetime. All I know is, I'm very happy
to share that work and experience with this one beside me.

---

We did reach the ascent route in one more rappel, but had no anchors around. No problem,
but the prospect of downclimbing a chimney without protection was a little
nervewracking. Barbara spied a piton about 5 meters above us. I set a belay there,
and gave her a belay on the downclimb. She reported it was easy, and so I soloed down.

Barbara found the next anchor, threaded the rope through, and had two beautiful coils for
me to throw. She sat there smiling and proud! I hated to say this, but darn it, it wasn't the right anchor for us...it would have led down the slabs of Jubiläumsweg, and back into the 
uncertainty of a too-short rope on blank terrain. I preferred the anchors in the blockier
ground of the Westwand. So we had to move and recoil the ropes. Seriously though, what a
gal!

Three more abseils got us down...down to water and apples, with spicy sausage for me.
We began the long journey back home, dodging major traffic jams...it seemed like all
Deutschland was on the road, crammed together in mobile parking lots. For us, the dark
northern shore of the Chiemsee, back roads and stars above. We are always home.
