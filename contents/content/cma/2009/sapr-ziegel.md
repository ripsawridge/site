### Ziegelspitz
_April 24, 2009_

I had some time this morning for a quick hike. After weeks of great weather, I
was surprised to see fresh snow only about 1000 feet up on the trail. This
mountain is part of the Notkarspitze massif, rising south of the monastery of
Ettal. Actually, I hoped to climb all the way up the Notkarspitze, but all that
snow, and plenty of tedious postholing on the ridge from Ochsensitz to
Ziegelspitze convinced me to call it a day there. When the snow melts it'll be
an excellent trail run I think. Peaks around with all the fresh snow looked
great. I gotta start wearing boots! 2800 feet elevation gain/loss, 2.5 hours up
and down.
