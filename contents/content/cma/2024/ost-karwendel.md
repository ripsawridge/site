I'd been thinking about hiking up something in the Karwendel for a while,
maybe Wörner or the Östliche Karwendelspitze. I'd never hiked up the latter
before, and I wanted to enjoy the scenic long valley from Scharnitz to the
Karwendelhaus. The last time I had been in there was on the [long walk with
Uli from Lenggries to Scharnitz](../2019/full-karwendel.html), and I was too exhausted at the end to
properly enjoy it! I decided to ride my mountain bike to the meadow below the
Karwendelhaus, then hike from there.

This worked out well. The morning was frosty, but the scenery was gorgeous.
It's no wonder this is a national park. I remembered the turn-off to hike up
Wörner from the south side one day, but continued on, finally pushing the bike
for a bit in the upper switchbacks to the meadow.

I hiked up easily in the sun, choosing to do the climb from the west side
because I prefered grassy slopes. I caught some *gämse* napping on a sunny
terrace. The way is pretty steep and scruffy in the upper part, but I emerged
on a false summit with no difficulties. Here I met a man and woman who came
up from the east side. Then I walked the ridgeline over to the true summit 
and chatted with another couple of folks. Very crisp, clear air and the peaks
were very defined and inviting.

I went down the same way to maximize the sun exposure. Shadows had crept into the
valley when I reached my bike and I set off to the sound of party-goers singing
in the Karwendelhaus above (maybe there is a winter-room?). My bike is
rather too small for me, so it was a bit awkward going down the steep roads.
I had to hang back behind the seat or I felt like I'd tip over the front!

I chased the setting sun down the valley, it remained always one bend ahead of
me. 1900 meters up and down.
