September 19-20, 1998

Saturday Steve and I climbed 5 routes at the Swauk Pinnacles near Swauk Pass.We
had a great time and climbed non-stop, quitting for pizza in Cashmere at dusk.
My memories of the routes are as follows.



First was Ann's Anthill, on Little Sphinx, a class 5.0 route to the top of the
rock.  I led this one, finding many wonderful protection opportunities.  Steve
followed, and we rapped down.  The climbing is not very memorable, but hey, it
was my first lead!



Next was Bastet, on the west side of the rock, rated at 5.6.  Steve led into a
little depression under an overhang, clipping a bolt.  Then he moved out to the
left and to the top with a daring move.  This one was pretty fun and
challenging.



Then we did The Cleft on Rock of Ages, rated at 5.6.  I led this one and got
fairly sketched out escaping an overhanging off-width crack.  With my arm jammed
insecurely I scrabbled for handholds on the adjoining face, finding nothing to
pull me out of the crack.  My muscles started trembling and I thought about the
consequences of a fall, which would be at least a small pendulum.  Finally, I
escaped, somewhat shaken.  Steve did a lieback, finding it much easier.  This
was a lesson for me to think before blindly getting out into a sketchy
situation.  I think I learned well, because I overcame difficulties with thought
rather than force for much of the rest of the trip.



Then we walked for an hour, trying to find The Sentinel, which sported a 5.6
crack route "Return to Rock."  We *finally* found it and Steve led a very
enjoyable crack to a good stance before a monster crack.  Steve went up a bit,
finding nowhere to rest.  His arms tired, but there was no protection.  He had
to come down a bit and place a cam in an adjoining horizontal crack.  This took
all his effort, so I lowered him off the cam and went up myself to attempt the
finish.  Indeed the crack was tough!  I placed another cam higher up, then
heaved to the top with my last gasp.  I belayed Steve up from a cool, exposed
stance.



We finished the day with a long walk back to The Sphinx where I led Anubis,
again 5.6.  This was a spectacular climb to finish the day.  The climbing was
hard and very exposed, requiring a "stepping-into-the-void" type move right
before a walk-off ledge.  Flushed with success on the ledge, I decided to climb
to bolts on the very top.  There was incredible rope drag at the end of this
long pitch.  I was really hauling the rope up through the crux crack below.
Immensely satisfied, I clipped to the anchors and Steve came up.  We agreed that
this was one of the best and toughest climbs, with a great view all the way up
and a comfy belay ledge on the top.  I'd like to do this one again!



Later we met other climbers who expressed amazement over the rope
drag on Anubis, so it wasn't just us!

After excellent pizza in Cashmere, we bivied in an apple orchard in
the hills to the north.  We planned to do two routes at Peshastin
in the morning, then maybe the Castle outside of Leavenworth.
Both Peshastin routes were 2 pitches each, and the Castle was three,
so we had an ambitious day planned.



Dozens of howling coyotes woke us at midnight.  Many of them were
extremely close!  We had intermittent rain, then a real shower
around 5 am.  Apples fell from the trees all night.



Despite the rain, Peshastin was dry, a real boon.  We hiked up to Dinosaur Slab
to begin the two-pitch "Potholes."  Steve led the first, facing no protection
for the lower third of the route.  He placed a hex but it popped out due to rope
movement.  There was an exciting 5.7+ move on a mini-overhang, thankfully
protected by bolts.  Steve brought me up, and I continued on lead for pitch two,
rated at 5.8.  The fun and challenging route was bolt-protected until the last
20 feet.  The guidebook suggested a cam, but I couldn't find anywhere to place
one.  I ran the rope out, ending up puzzled in a little cavelet.  I must have
spent 15 minutes standing here, looking for protection and a way out...finding
neither!  An attempt to move right back to the face had to be aborted with
careful downclimbing.  I could see the anchor bolts so close!



Finally, the sequence came to me...stemming against one wall, use
one good handhold to then stem against the other wall, then grab a
positive hold outside the cave/chimney to escape.  I was clipped in
moments later and belaying Steve up.  He found the route very challenging,
however, he made short, easy
work of the chimney which gave me so much trouble.  We enjoyed the
view, and carefully rapped down the two pitches.



Potholes had taken all morning, so we decided to head to the Castle now and skip
the other route on Martian Slab we wanted to do.  We found the Castle, an
impressive tower over the Wenatchee River.  Climbers were milling about
everywhere, and we doubted that the climb would be open.  A woman was making the
exposed step-across from the top of Jello Tower (end of pitch 1) to the wall of
the Castle, but the 1st pitch was free.  We hurriedly roped up, all the people
around making us nervous!  Steve led, fighting sweaty hands in the greasy
polished chimney.  He was able to place a nut, a cam and a hex.  Once, his leg
was caught by the rope, but he worked through it, much to my relief!  Steve
reached the top, and I followed up, finding that the weird chimney/crack made me
nervous.  There were too many pointy things to hit, even for a short fall.  At
the top, I was thirsty and tired.  Steve and I agreed we were mentally
exhausted, and decided to rap down rather than continue with the next pitch.



We descended on a fun free-hanging rappel, the best of the trip.
Back in the car, we headed over to Barney's Rubble for some friction
climbing and a very strenuous crack/lieback climb, both on top rope.  This
was a lot of fun...we could drop all the hardware and the mental
strain!  



Both of us hung on the rope during the 5.8 crack there, and my goal
is to repeat the climb with a bit of slack in the rope.



Thus ended our first Cragging School, and it was a 
big success. We didn't get hurt and we learned a few things!
