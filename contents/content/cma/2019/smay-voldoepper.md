I decided to do a double hike day. First the Voeldopperspitz near Kramsach. Lots of trail-runners,
it seems to be getting very popular. After this I ate a sandwich and drove to the trailhead
for the Kaiserlift in Kufstein. However I couldn't find a parking place, so I settled for using
the Oberndorfer Weg again to get to the hut, even though I'd been there just a few days before!
Somehow, the last 300 meters from the sattle to the hut were so tiring! Had a piece of cake
and a Radler, then wandered down, first getting a nap in the sun in the fields.

Approx. 2000 meters up and down for the day.
