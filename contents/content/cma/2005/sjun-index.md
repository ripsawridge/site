### Index Climbing, June 21 2005

Carlos and I climbed Princely Ambitions (5.10a), which was really fun. I hadn't
been to Index in a long time. I thought he did great on the route.
Surprisingly, the 2nd pitch was hard for him, as he is unused to hand-jamming
of the Index variety. A great time!
