Today was German Reunification Day...a holiday!
  
  
Kris was feeling kind of sick, so in the morning I played with the boys
then took them to the Jogoli playland. We had a good time there. While
they napped, I re-read parts of the compelling book [Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue See](http://www.amazon.com/Ship-Gold-Deep-Blue-Sea/dp/0375703373/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-6765719-8289256?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191434915&sr=8-2).
Such a neat story. Apparently Tommy Thompson is missing now, and the investors
were never paid? Jeez...

In the afternoon Kris watched the boys for a while, and then I let her
go back to bed. I tossed the boys in the stroller, got on the bike and
we rode to the Olympic Park. We had a great time running up the hill. A
man was collecting apples from a tree, and he retrieved 3 for us. We climbed
higher and sat to eat our small, tart apples.

Later we ran around some more and climbed to the highest point. We could
see the mountains in the distance behind the city. It was a beautiful early
evening. We went to a little kiosk where I got a Radler (1/2 beer, 1/2
lemonade), and the boys got apple juice. We also shared some ice cream.

I had to take a leak and Elijah said he did too. Wow, that is a first?
Well I helped him unhook his diaper and he gave it a try, but he didn't
have to go after all. I keep hoping though!
