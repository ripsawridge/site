### Tiger Mountain, February 13, 2005

Okay, I couldn't resist. I hiked up the Section Line Trail to reach the
summit in snow flurries. I then went to West Tiger 2 and finally West
Tiger 1, where a cute little hut provided respite from cold wind.
A fun jog down the "Bootleg Trail" got me to trails of Poo Poo Point,
where a long jog led back to the Bus Trail and the car, for a great
2 hour 20 minute tour of West Tiger Mountain.
