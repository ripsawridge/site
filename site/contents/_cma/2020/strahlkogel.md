Uli and I hadn't climbed together in quite a while. So it was great
when he called with the idea of climbing the Strahlkogel in the
Larstiger Mountains. I'd never been in there...they were always hazy
peaks on the western edge of my favorite ski touring peaks in the Sellrain.
He said the Westgrat (west ridge) would be a great climb of UIAA grade III
rock. He was hazy about the descent, liking to keep the options open
about which valley we might descend -- maybe the Larstig or the
Zwieselbach, or the Grastal of our ascent route.

We drove down the night before. Uli was enthusiastic about his one-man
tent, a Jack Wolfskin Gossamer. I bought one too, and it arrived
just before I left to pick him up in Munich! So we set up our identical
tents in the dark, happily to sleep safely dry as the last moisture from
a day of storm came down.

We were walking a bit after six, and reached the lovely Grastalsee
("Grass Valley Lake") after a couple hours. Uli told an entertaining story
about an incredible expedition experience in the Himalaya. It seemed that
a very big part of the adventure was in logistics among the many people
of a  very different culture. Clearly, it was very rewarding.

Above the still-slumbering lake.

Above the lake, we hopped boulders made slippery by invisible ice.
"It must have been rain from yesterday that did this," said Uli, deftly
executing controlled falls uphill as black rocks slid underneath him.
Eventually I found a tongue of ice, and put on *steigeisen* to keep going.
Unfortunately, in here we realized we'd gone the wrong way, and now had
a mountain between us and our peak.

Uli thought we could stay high and traverse the mountain-side. We did this
for a while, but then it got quite steep and we were forced down. With the
frozen rocks, this was quite time-consuming and I felt our chance to climb
the peak was slipping away from us. I wanted to bomb straight back down
quickly and try again -- heartbreaking as it was!

In the end we did a bit of both. Before reaching the lake, we were able to
contour a great moraine, then clamber onto it's crest for quick travel to
a hanging valley with a stream running from the Grastalferner. We rested a
bit, then put on *steigeisen* and navigated tricky slabs of icy snow
above the raging creek, until we were firmly on snowfields and then
the glacier.

Above a small glacier-fed lake, we saw the south wall of the
Grastaler Grieskogel, spanning to the Strahlkogel. We wanted to climb it
more or less directly to the notch between the peaks, which we could
vaguely see above the odd combination of smooth wall and rubble before us.

We saw a ramp trending from the highest patch of snow on the glacier
up and right to somewhere near the notch. But it was hard to tell if
it's somewhat lower angle would be useful to follow, or merely loose
and time-consuming. We opted to head straight up somewhat right of the
base of this ramp. This would allow us to connect to, and use the ramp
if it seemed useful. Either way, we'd need to go generally up and right.

After grovelling in dirt and sliding rocks for a few minutes, we hit more
solid stone. Uli led the way up and right through occasionally interesting
steep sections. We were somewhat surprised to reach the ridge crest quickly --
so far things weren't coming easy on this day! We had a fantastic view of
the narrow ridge to our summit. Many high peaks around us were obscured by
cloud that seemed to bubble up from the surrounding valleys. Hoping that
wouldn't happen to our peak, we started up the ridge.

{% image images/IMG_3573.jpg %}
Our goal lies ahead -- or is the span in between?

We decided to travel without the rope for as long as possible, feeling that
if we avoided using it until the route steepens below the summit block, we'd
save a lot of time. We really enjoyed this section, scrambling along with
incredible views down and out to cloud-bedecked summits. High plateaus of
snow, intermingled with cloud and black spikes and turrets of stone.
The difficulties were capped nicely with a hard move creeping around a
short overhanging gable. It was like a signal: *maybe now it's time for
the rope.*

Coming 'round the gabel,

The rock steepens.

At a little notch we got out my never-used purple 30 meter rope. Uli
outfit me with gear. We had two cams, a great selection of nuts and many
slings. I stepped around to the right and headed straight up a chimney of
chunky granitic shards. The many hours of toil in the *Ger√∂llfelder* below
finally felt an acceptable cost for the clean, integrated movement in
a space seldom attained. The orchestral *Bauwerk* of firm, deep footings
in the earth balanced the envelope-thin edge of this "Other-World"
of lines and angles opposite to the norm. There was a sense of an
equation completing.

We stood on the summit.

After a nap, it was time to head down...the *Ostgrat* would be our way.
We imagined it might be easier.

Ha!

----

Travelling in coils, we navigated small vertical steps and many exposed
notches. Most spikes had to be climbed over, but occasionally it was
possible to traverse around on the right, following shattered ramps
around corners that led reassuringly back to the security of the crest
somewhat below.

After an hour of concentrated work, we got a look back at the up-and-down
world through which we'd threaded our existence:

Here with (as near as I can tell) our line marked.

Uli prepares to cross a typical slabby step.

We touched snow as the ridge leveled off. We decided to turn
left here and make our way down to the Larstigscharte, which
would allow us to turn down the Larstigtal, or after
descending the steeper east side of the *scharte*, heading
east to the Zwieselbachjoch. The rock changed texture to
some degree, with more precariously stacked blocks and a
higher quartz-content, making the rock lighter. Still pleasant
climbing, but holds had to be tested carefully.

After another hour we stood before a rickety-looking tower.
Uli hoped to traverse the left side, but the slabs were iced
over. He considered making a traverse across snow/ice at a lower
level, then working back to the ridge on a mixture of slabs
and snow. Oddly reluctant to leave the ridge, I suggested to climb
up the tower, which looked to be a few exposed moves of grade IV-.
"You want to send me up there?" queried Uli.

"Yes!"

I guess he grinned, but he was out of sight behind a car-sized block
separating my belay from him. Cautiously, Uli mantled up over one step,
then a second. A sling protected the final moves. I wish I'd somehow
taken a picture -- it was an impressive line! This picture
of the tower from just above will have to do:

I've **doctored** the photo to blur the background and make the
ridge hyper-focused. I think it tells a psychological truth about
life on a sharp crest. We went up and over.

More climbing ahead, but Uli is all smiles.

The rest of the way to the Larstigscharte became somewhat exhausting.
My energy, especially, was flagging. Finally we reached a notch with an
awkward sling belay. Uli suggested climbing down the gray slabs below us
to reach the east side of the Larstigscharte. I couldn't see any possibility
of protecting that terrain, and I didn't have his certainty that it was
so very easy. I suggested an abseil, so we rigged this up.

Tossing the ropes, they fell far short of what we would need to gain some
kind of intermediate anchor. Having rested a bit, my head was cleared and
it made sense to carry on descending the ridge to the notch. Uli felt
it was possible to descend here based on his prior experience in the area
with Christiane (they'd descended slopes with a similar look right at the
notch). So anyway, we carried on.

Two minutes later, I heard Uli laugh. Basically -- we were at the notch!
He pointed to where snow touched the ridge one meter below us on the
much more gentle west side of the Larstigscharte. We continued another 5
minutes, then we were comfortably at the notch proper.

Wow. But for me it was clear. It was time to stop technical climbing because
exhaustion impairs judgement, and I was quite exhausted. "We can descend
this way," said Uli. I think he would have liked to extend the trip around
into the Zwieselbachtal, but I wasn't that interested in getting down that
steep pass. In the end though, we were both very happy with the trip through
the Larstigstal.

But still, we had to get there! We put on *steigeisen,* then marched down
the glacier.

Descending the Larstigferner.

Uli did a great job finding the way down slabs at the base of the glacier,
then we crossed boulderfields until reaching a stunning moraine-crest
that led straight down to the green and well-watered middle tier of the
valley.

I trailed along behind, at first wondering why I was so tired. Later, I
began to enjoy the silence and become grateful for this wonderful valley.
I breathed and walked in silence, gradually finding the joy buried by
the stress of the final ridge. We talked about our sons and the good work
they are doing.

Goodbye!

Now in cool, steep forest, we quickly descended to the road in the mighty
Horlachtal. We rested on a bench and met our first person of the day: a
very intelligent man checking the electric fences. He asked us about
what we'd done and seemed fully familiar with not only the ground, but
the whole *gestalt* of the experience. Interesting.

Another hour of walking brought us to the car at 9 pm. A 15 hour day!
I forgot what big mountain trips are like!

Thanks Uli for a great time. Thanks Strahlkogel. May the "rays" sent out
from your heart like a beacon continue to beckon the odd-folks of the mountains
to lay hands on your consciousness -- feeling the truth of it, and thus
exposing themselves to your truth.
