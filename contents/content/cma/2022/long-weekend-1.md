I did four great days in the mountains, first two alone, then two with
Barbara. The avalanche conditions in Tyrol were quite bad. All the tours
I chose were quite safe under these conditions. The snow wasn't always
the best, especially because I stayed at low elevation, however, it was
some great exercise.

## First up, Vorderunnütz
_February 3, 2022_

Pretty wonderful ski tour.
Foolishly, I parked at a lot in Steinberg am Rofan
which required 5 euros
for the day, but if I had walked 30 seconds away, I would have seen
where all the savvy people park for free. I asked one of the men who
parked at the free lot if it was necessary to pay. He said he didn't
think so, but then again, he added -- he is a member of the village!

So at least I made one person happy. It is fun to feel part of a private
club. In his case, he *knows* he'd never get a ticket there because
the people are like family. Me being a stranger, and reminding him that
there are those who feel insecure in the world because they are unknown,
allowed him to feel warm and even loved. Good!

I skinned up this small ski area, only about 250 meters elevation gain.
But it was well-maintained by just two operators. At the top I looked
at the map and saw that I'd have to do a kind of strange trip around
the back side of a mountain to continue my route. My friend from the
morning asked to be sure I knew the way, and I said goodbye to him.

A pleasant couple of hours followed, skinning on flat and gently
ascending trails, finally reaching first one log cabin and then another,
at which I was able to sit down on a window sill and stand on a bench
in front of the cabin. The snow was so high! While I drank tea, my
head dodged beams in the rafters of the porch roof. The sun was
burning through low clouds.

Higher, I got above the trees and had quite a route-finding challenge.
There were no tracks. I only saw sign of other skiers from the prior
week near the summit which was wind-scoured ice. But down here I had
to make my way on awkward traverses, sometimes climbing too high
into little *latschen* groves. I checked the map often, and mostly
traversed west and then south, trying to check my urge to climb too
steeply and prematurely.

A look to the Achensee.

Higher still, I could finally interpret the terrain. I made switchbacks
up a shoulder to a ridge on very nice snow, not deep powder, but a
powdery layer over a reasonably firm base. I traveled on a ridgetop,
then climbed after a slight descent onto the icy summit ridge. Conditions
were very different here, and I stopped to put on a jacket against
the strong wind coming from the north and west. Now I could see the
Achensee. My summit was beset by *enormous* cornices. They had a kind
of dual architecture: the usual inverted mushrooms, but this time
supported by strong leaning columns of snow. It was unusual. I stayed
well back from them on the final bit to the summit!

All the mountains were gorgeous and quite snowy. The Karwendel peaks
looked especially black and frightening with their snowy gullies and
improbable faces.

The ski of the upper mountain went very quickly and was very pleasant
as well. I only saw in my guidebook later that I had an option to go
straight down to the south which would have eliminating much traversing,
and much tedium later in the region of the cabins. However, the book
also says that way had more avalanche danger and so I'm glad I didn't
play with it. Again I drank tea in the roof-rafters of the higher
cabin, then, tiring, went through the ups and downs to reach the
little ski lift. From there, the descent was smooth and easy.

A great day! Something around 1100 meters up and down.

A long, lonely traverse.

## Sonnwendjochhaus

I was back to the east side of the Rofan Mountains, in some of the same
terrain as on my trip January 4th to snowshoe up the Pletzachkogel and Roßkogel.
This time, I would make my summit the Sonnwendjochhaus -- that little house
at the abandoned ski lift station a bit below the summit of the Roßkogel.
It didn't seem reasonable to deal with the steep snow on that final push.

A great couple from Kramsach.

Starting from the base station, I followed the lower ski area slope with
a working rope tow, then continued skinning up switchbacks on a road, which
finally led to the old ski slope. Before too long I was on the broad slope
on which the rest of the route is visible. I simply set to work, and
before long was on top. I sat and drank tea, talking with a nice couple
from Kramsach about hiking on the Continental Divide Trail later in the year.
The snow was perfect in the upper half, just beautiful skiing. Down low,
it got heavy and a bit ugly and icy as I neared the road. I continued down
an alternate icy road to the car.

## Sonnwendjochhaus again!

I was back the next day with Barbara! We headed up. It was considerable
work for her. I'd been telling her about how wonderful ski touring is, but
here, on her second ski tour ever (and the first in nearly 2 years), it
didn't feel so amazing. But we continued to the top. This time, we discovered
that the hot tub was on at the little mountain hotel just above the abandoned
lift building. Amazing! But no one was home. So strange!

We loved the skiing down, at least until the ugly part. Going down the
icy road was easy enough.

We slept at a hotel in Kramsach and prepared for the next day...

## Feldalphorn

At the parking lot in the morning it was amazing how poorly people parked,
leaving awkwardly sized 1.5 meter spaces between cars. This irritated me
because this mountain was one of the few avalanche safe tours in the area,
and naturally on such a bad weekend (9 people had died already), folks
would rightfully want to come here for a safe tour.

Barbara asked a guy if he could move his car slightly so we could park. But
he said he had his ski boots on and moving the car would feel funny wearing
ski boots. So we got out our shovels and gloves so we could dig out a space
on the edge of the lot. I figured it would take about 20 minutes of effort.
The thing was, I knew there was another good tour about 3 kilometers up
the road, but because of the avalanche danger I ruled out taking Barbara
there. I didn't even know that it was at that lot that a husband and wife
had been killed by an avalanche 2 days before (the location of the bodies
and the avalanche discovered, amazingly, by drone late Friday night).

I hollered a few angry words at the back of the departing man, unwilling to
move his car slightly for us, then set to work digging. The man eventually
came back and lectured me about yelling. He said I wasn't the only person
in the world. I agreed heartily. I'm just a person who wants to park and doesn't
see why I should be rubuked for a small request. Oh well. This kind of thing
has to do with the number of people who ski tour...numbers perhaps inflated
by the many rules around visiting ski areas in the COVID-era. It is disappointing.
It would have been good if I didn't contribute to any rancor or stress in
the morning. I don't regret making a little noise, however. I do think we're
all in this together. To my way of thinking, there are "city rules" and there
are different rules in the mountains. In a city, people are strangers to
each other and happily deny each other even small helps. But at a backcountry
parking lot, where plowed space is limited, and we're all going out in
a self-sufficient way with our avalanche gear, etc., I expect a different
orientation of one individual to another. Open, friendly, willing to help
if requested should be the way of things out there.

I do thank the man for returning.

So anyways, we headed up. Barbara continued on a difficult learning path.
It was amazing how much there is to know about skinning up steep, icy
skin tracks. I had no idea, but it's true. There is so much shifting of
weight at just the right time...so many rules of thumb about when to aggressively
pound the skis into an icy slope and when to be delicate and trust the skins.
We were crabby with each other in the middle of the trip, though this led
to greater understanding of each others experience as time went on. Practically
speaking, Barbara made an adjustment in the length of her ski poles that helped
tremendously.

On Feldalphorn together.

As we approached the summit, we could see weather coming in. It was in fact
a major storm. Clouds swallowed summits to the west of us and the wind picked
up. On top we looked around, at the Rettenstein especially, and we thought
of Mara. Going down, we enjoyed a few small powder stashes on shady aspects.
I could see a sense of confidence building in Barbara. Now she had 2 summits
under her belt.

We drove home and heard an amazing wind storm in the night. I heard breaking
glass at one point outside! So it was a rather stormy day in several ways!
