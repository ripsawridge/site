Pete and I met up to climb the Aiguille Dibona by the famous
"Visite Obligatoire" route. We were hiking up from the parking lot
in the late morning on July the 9th.

I'm writing this more than 10 years later, having somehow lost an earlier
report. Piecing evidence together from the pictures and my hazy memory,
it seems that we climbed the first 2 pitches of Visite Obligatoire in
the late afternoon after arriving at the hut, and then the next morning
chose a couple of easier pitches to make the overall climb less demanding
(also just for variety).

The route was fantastic, especially a famous lieback pitch higher up.

We had another day there and climbed an adventurous route on the right side
of the Aiguille Dibona, making full use of our double ropes to string
together sections with sparse protection, in big contrast with the
Visite Obligatoire which was entirely bolted.
