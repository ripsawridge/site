## Part the First - bad weather...

Steve and I drove over to Pinedale and spent the night in the city
camping area (which is fantastic!). Then we looked at the weather.
Hmm...a front is coming in. So we spent the next morning climbing
at an area called Lizard Rocks. It was only so-so. First a 5.7 route where
an important hold had fallen off, then we top-roped a pretty nice
5.9 route, however we simply couldn't figure out the crux moves at a
roof and had to pull on a draw. We tried a few more things, but it
was rather tough. Then it rained hard, almost hailing. We drove out
to the Big Sandy Trailhead and slept for the night. But first I
hiked over to the Big Sandy Lodge and ordered a burger for dinner.

Toaster House!*

It was great to run into Vermont Mountain Girl there, who I'd met on the
CDT in 2022 when she was keeping things organized at the Toaster House
in Pie Town. She had just started the job, and made me an excellent
veggie burger with fresh mushrooms. Fantastic...I hope we meet again on
our second trip in there.

We hiked in with 5 days of food and our gear, which felt pretty heavy!
The scenery was amazing though, and I made sure to rest every hour or so
and take off shoes and socks. Steve pulled ahead, and I found him at a
great campsite by Shadow Lake. I took a nap as it rained in the afternoon,
but enjoyed sitting out by the lake for the evening looking at the peaks.
I'd last been here in 2023 with Cory. Steve and I discussed the weather.
I emphasized that I thought it was important to be positive about
the next day, but he was a bit grim on our chances. Turns out -- he understood
the weather better than I did! Anyway, we planned to get up at five and
climb the Tower Ridge Route on Overhanging Tower (simulclimbing to 5.5
or so, according to the guidebook).

However, it started raining again at 2 am, and kept up until dawn. Big sigh!
So much for our weather window.

In a pause between rain, we decided we'd hike out and wait a couple days
until that blue-bird weather arrived a few days later.

We did this, and I got two nights at the Jackalope Lodge, where I'd stayed
before with Cory. There were a number of CDT hikers there, also bikers.
It turned into a fun evening with wine and beer. The wine came from a
Canadian doing the bike route, and the beer from an interesting fellow
named Randall who hiked the CDT every year and did trail maintenence.
Many great talks. Also, Steve and I met a Polish couple hiking the trail
and planned to meet later for climbing at the City of Rocks.

## Part the Second

So...we tried again. This time the packs were a bit lighter.

*And again...*

We hiked in, set up at the same place (the lake was less crowded now)
and went to sleep after a great sunset.

*Steve hiking up to Tower Ridge*

In the morning, we made the approach and chose a line on Tower Ridge,
a buttress that appears detached from Overhanging Rock from below.
I led up for about 60 meters and set a belay at a point where we
wanted to traverse around to the right to gain a ridge crest.

From here, Steve went around a corner and up a fun crack climb with good
protection, then continued climbing a long ways to a point where the sun
was only a short ways further. I led a couple of shorter pitches over
small breaks in the ridge, at one point climbing up an awkward crack (5.7
or so) on the crest, for which I set a belay. Then Steve climbed over a
tower to another stance, then continued leading a bit down to a notch
that marked the end of the route.

*Near the summit of Tower Ridge, below Overhanging Tower*

Here we had an important discussion about points of style and some
assumptions (mostly, but not entirely wrong) we'd been making about
our respective motivations and preferences. It turned out to be a great
communication that healed some divisions that were growing over the past
several trips (highly successful trips, it should be noted).

As older fellas, we're dealing with the fact that climbing has been a
very important part of our lives, but in different ways across the nearly
twenty years we climbed apart (aside from a great trip in 2016 when Steve
and Ever came to the Dolomites). We'd specialized into different areas.
We also both came to value all these other parts of life that are amazing,
and are naturally inclined to be cautious in order to preserve all of those parts.
There isn't the *strong need* to do this or any other particular climb
any more, though at the same time, we know that without some aggression
in the direction of the goal, we might overvalue comfort in a way that
ultimately diffuses that joyful concentration of energy that climbing
often provides. Finally, all of this "thinking" about where we are in
life incorporates the other (your partner) as a *mental model*, and includes assumptions
about what your partner may or may not be thinking. It just gets complicated!

We are men who have been gifted with much life, and much joy in that life.
Knowing this, we have some reasonable fear of loss. If we fail to face that
more complex internal terrain cheerfully, and together, we end up with
a distorted picture, in which private doubts loom larger than they should.
We're more complex than we were. But we can still move as one, and with
confidence. This, we re-learned!

And so!

We decided the best thing to do was run over to Shark's Nose on the
ledge system that wraps around Overhanging Tower and do that climb first,
now that Tower Ridge was done, since the NW Buttress of Shark's Nose has
a variety of complexities, including 7 or 8 rappels to get back to the
starting point. We'd then finish up with Overhanging Tower on the way back
if we weren't too worn out. It was easy enough getting over to the start
of the buttress, via 3rd and 4th class scrambling. Steve sent me
out for the first pitch.

{% image /cmaimages/2025/20_IMG_5349.jpg %}
*Steve at the first belay for Shark's Nose*

There were some thin moves (low 5th class, no protection) to get started,
then it was a romp past a couple of rappel anchors to stand in a gully
at the transition between the north and west sides of the peak. I took
off again, straight up a crack to another rappel anchor, then for a traverse
to the head of the gully, and some easy 5th class terrain above. Steve
said he'd heard a rock move from the rope scraping across a ledge above
him. Argh, I'd made an error: the rope could knock off some big rocks
on him. So I downclimbed most of the pitch, unclipped from the rap anchor
and reclimbed, making sure the rope was clear of this dangerous ledge.

I brought Steve up, and took off again, this time for an enjoyable
5.5 pitch up a face with a moss-filled crack on my right. I belayed from
a pod with good cracks for an anchor just below a crack that would wrap
around to the south side of the peak. For the next pitch, I headed up
this slightly alarming crack, which kind of pushed me out with a lot of
exposure beneath! Clipping into a rappel anchor on the south face, I was
unsure of what to do, first climbing up to the crest and looking around the
corner to the left -- that doesn't look good! I came back to the rap anchor
and brought Steve up. Two guys doing the Cirque Traverse were climbing
a 5.9 finger crack to my right. The key now was to go over there, then
follow a ledge at the base of this crack around the corner to a belay
at the base of what I'll call the "5.6 crack pitch." Though it looked
tougher than that!

{% image /cmaimages/2025/21_IMG_5360.jpg %}
*A few pitches up...*

*Steve at the belay before sneaking around to the south side*

{% image /cmaimages/2025/24_IMG_5371.jpg %}
*Traversing to the base of the 5.6 crack*

Indeed, the first moves felt hard -- a finger crack went vertically up,
then angling further to the right/east before heading straight up
again. Here, I saw a piton up a crack to the right, but it turns out
that is off-route (5.9 terrain). I committed to a long slab without
protection, then clipped two old ring pitons at a headwall above, and
made a few more moves to a rappel anchor with the slabby summit pitch
directly above. That had been a very interesting pitch.

Steve took off for the last pitch, improbably finding two good gear placements
on the slabby face as he climbed. He tagged the summit, then came back down
a few meters to a belay at the highest rappel anchor. I was glad he led
it, as the slab was quite steep -- or maybe it was the huge air below!

{% image /cmaimages/2025/28_IMG_5387.jpg %}
*On the summit!*

I stood on the summit and thundered my advice to the valleys below, then
returned to the anchor. Wow, what a climb...

*Another look down*

{% image /cmaimages/2025/31_IMG_5398.jpg %}
*Abseiling down...*

Steve volunteered to lead the abseils, which was great. There are several points
where the route goes around a corner. In fact, the very first abseil presents
a choice: should you balance on the ridge crest, or go down to a ledge, then
walk out to the belay? (we walked) The next abseil was straightforward, if steep,
but the third abseil raised some doubts. We know the next station was far out
on the ridge to the west. Should we lean skiers right a long ways? But we
can't really see down there, and the terrain is smooth, so the rope won't
preserve you in your ideas to be far off of the fall line.

In the end, we decided to go straight down, then simply walk out the ledge to the west.
This was a good decision, turning a fraught abseil into an easy one.

*Here is the 5.9 variant, stepped around to reach the 5.6 version of the pitch*

Soon we were coming back into the shaded north side of the peak. For the last
rappel, I ended up half-climbing on a traverse to get back to our shoes
at the anchor point. Now we could put the rope away and make plans for the
summit of Overhanging Tower. We were pretty tired, and hadn't had any rest at
all. We decided to scramble up the ledges on that peak, then sit and eat
something at the point when the scramble route for that summit leaves the
ledge trail.

This was a good idea -- 10 or 15 minutes of stillness gave us a LOT of our
energy back! We left the rope, and just scrambled to the summit, initially with
some 3rd and 4th class, then walking, then a final (let's say) 5.2 or 5.3 pitch
in a nice crack/dihedral. It was great to be up there and look over the edge!

We reversed the route, picked up our gear and followed a cairn'd route to
a point below the Wolf's Head / Overhanging Tower saddle. From here we
followed our noses down to the point where we started climbing Ridge
Tower, which felt like a thing we'd done years ago! It was a very long
descent. Never difficult, but you always have to pay attention amid the
sliding rocks, dirt, scree, sharp edges of various kinds, tumbling
boulders, etc.

*A good day!*

{% image /cmaimages/2025/42_IMG_5440.jpg %}
*Scrambling down...*

Now on familiar ground, we quickly reached the lake and (for my part) wheezed
mightily at every remaining bit of uphill travel getting around the lake
to our camp. It was exactly sunset. Steve repaired to his tent, and I
drank a gallon of water and ate dinner in the dark, looking up at the
peaks for the last time.

As I smoked a cigar under the stars, I saw two headlamps around the elevation
of the saddle, but a good ways off left. Later, we decided this was the
abseil route from Wolf's Head. Only, they may have had trouble moving off
towards the saddle in order to descend to the cirque. The lights were on
there for an hour, and I fancied one of them was swinging wildly, as if
on a rope. Maybe? Or maybe an illusion. Off to bed.

In the morning, we hiked out in pleasant weather. We spent a night in Pinedale,
where surprisingly it rained. Then we drove home. Thanks to Steve for a great
trip...thanks to God for weather, good judgment and solid granite everywhere.
