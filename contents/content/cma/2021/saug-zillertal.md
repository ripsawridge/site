### Zillertal biking weekend
_August 20, 2021_

I took Violetta the bike in Mantra the van out to the Zillertal for a couple of bike trips.
First I did a [tour on the *Zillertaler Höhenstrasse*](https://www.komoot.com/tour/460531859), which was a real pleasure because of the
well-maintained asphalt road. I had to push the bike for much of the upper part of the tour as it became extra steep.
The weather was excellent. I ate a fantastic lunch at the Wedelhütte at the end of the tour.
This was about 1900 meters up and down.

I had a great evening and chatted with a man there with his grandkids about life a little bit.
In the early evening, I visited a wonderful new or restored rustic church in Hochfügen.

The next day I did [a tour to the Lackenhütte from Fügen](https://www.komoot.com/tour/461772458), then down to Buch, and back along the flats around
the mountain. This tour was a more moderate 1500 meters up and down. I really enjoyed the descent, especially
from Kuglmoos on down -- 600 meters of asphalt road, not too steep, just coasting and enjoying the scenery.
