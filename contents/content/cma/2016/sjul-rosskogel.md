I hiked up from road far below, avoiding the toll road. I think it was
the Tieftalbach. The steep descent down the west side of the
Weißstein was especially interesting. I was hoping to reach the
Pieder Spitze, but in the never ending ups and downs of the Koflerspitzen,
realizing I had to reverse the whole route, I decided to turn back.
This time I followed the south and then east ridge descent of the
Roßkogel to the summit called Köegele. 

A most interesting day. 1850 meters up and down. Here are a few pics...
