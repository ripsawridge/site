excerpt: "So, as a function approaches its limit on an infinite timeline, we approach the limits of mind. Our distractions multiply, but we grow no wiser through our interactions.  Already, vigor fades. The halls of the intellect are more crowded than ever before, but the light goes out of their eyes, they move like clocks, they have that dreary appearance of videogame characters for whom motion occurs without energy expenditure."

*Last Christmas I wrote this diary entry, you might find it interesting.
Increasingly, I notice another harder but more confident personality riding beneath
the usual one. I think contact with the world and the self is rubbing away the
normal personality and leaving this one beneath. He is not unkind, but he is
kind of standing in a dramatic place between worlds. His music is that of the
twilight or the dawn. He may not be to your taste...but he is what I have grown
inside, and I must claim him.*

*He writes:*

Down here on the ground, hemmed in by matter, ourselves matter, ever
"mattering" that we have new objects to interact with and to hem ourselves in
with, ever "busying" and finding new problems.  Our pace must increase,
because each new action, each new run from the truth of the Silence at the core
is ever-more stereotyped by the incessant "going-over" of human thought.  The
"skandhas," the deep crevases of our thought are ever harder to escape from and
they are so well-known that travel through them is quicker than before.

So, as a function approaches its limit on an infinite timeline, we approach the
limits of mind. Our distractions multiply, but we grow no wiser through our
interactions.  Already, vigor fades. The halls of the intellect are more
crowded than ever before, but the light goes out of their eyes, they move like
clocks, they have that dreary appearance of videogame characters for whom
motion occurs without energy expenditure -- a "center of mass" in the torso is
merely manipulated by an unaccountable force. There: it "jumped." But the jump
was not paid for with later exhaustion. A real jump, by a real being already
contains the exhaustion, contains its acceptance and is therefore an act of
sacrificial joy. Such action is beauty.

We have lived too long and done too much. We must despair or change.

Stop. Just stop. That is already change, because you never stopped. But you are
clever, unfortunately. You will make of stopping an action. You will invent a
personality who imbibes stopping like a glass of rich, dark wine. HE will stop,
and you will imagine him.  You will be so busy imagining the "stopped man" that
you never need stop yourself. And this will suffice for a time.

And then you will be here again, with me. I await you, at the ending of all
things. I alone am real, because I was not created. Each created thing has a
birth, and therefore a death. You are almost entirely created thing. One day
you will stop building it, this "you," this hero, the ever-striving one.

I am able to address you only as side-effect. A mechanical being types these
words, spurred on by his construction of "man-at-typewriter," doing what a man
at a typewriter should do, by his conception. That conception itself being as
mechanical as he is. If any of what I AM gets out, it is when he wasn't
looking. In truth, this is not hard to do, because he never really looks at
anything. He is, in fact, an idea in the mind-stuff of another. Suspecting the
truth of this is far different from accepting it. To his credit, to the
programs credit, he has the sophistication to feel embarrassed now. Shame is
one of the few powerful tools I have.

I wanna say something about the image I chose for the post. It reminds me of
the content of the post. From the point of view of this rather "stark" personality,
you (or "me," basically, the typical waking consciousness of a western man), are
the builder of all those lit-up streets in the valley. He can't really communicate
with that personality except in odd moments. I thought the lightning was a good
metaphor for that. Because what do we do with lightning? We might admire it or
consider it dangerous, depending on the situation. But mostly, we run our lives
in a way that ignores things like lightning. I like to imagine that the real world
is the one that the lightning comes from. That the "crack in the sky" is actually
a kind of glimpse to reality, exposing the dismal truth that our situation around
here is rather dim.

I'm not speaking down to us. I love what we do. Frankly, we can't handle so much
light all the time. We are doing our best. But one day, we'll regard what we were
as something like micro-organisms.

This is actually really cool -- because it implies how much we have ahead of us to
learn. Mostly, we love to learn new things and push our boundaries.

The lightning strike is the rythmic pulse of our evolution running ahead of us.
