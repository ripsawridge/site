Helmut suggested a climb of "Opa Highway" on the Kopfkraxen (link to the
[always good Bergsteiger.at topo](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/opa-highway-kopfkraxen/)).

We were driving south of Munich by 6, then hiking up the old familiar way.
I was surprised to learn that the hut here had been destroyed by avalanche
a few years ago! That's really too bad...at the old site a few cows
greeted us moodily.

We left a backpack at the waterfall then hiked up to the scree below the face.
Two fellows were planning to climb "Vertical Freedom" (9-), a very hard route.
We saw them at the cliff face, but they were on the wrong pillar and needed
to be on the one we headed to, on the far left. We ended up over there
together. Thanks to them for kicking good steps across the steep snow
cone that protected the first pitch of the climb. In fact, our first belay
station was buried under the snow and we had an awkward time balancing
over the moat between snow and rock, trying to sort out the ropes and get
shoes on. We clipped to the second or third bolt of the climb to do this.

The beginning of pitch 4. Helmut lamented that he chose boring gray colors for
his wardrobe,
knowing that our pictures would not have the necessary "pizazz" to entertain
a young and distracted generation. ;)

Finally we were climbing.

**P1 3, 25 m** - This was a bit shorter because we started higher. Easy, to
a ledge where I only saw one bolt. Amazingly, my brain just didn't see the
other one. Helmut came up and responsibly fiddled in a cam in a crack on the
left. Only later, as he climbed above did I see the other bolt!

**P2 4, 35 m** - Helmut led up with some nice moments of climbing beginning
to shine through the easy and somewhat loose terrain.

**P3 5-, 25 m** - I walked across a ledge under the guys on "Vertical Freedom."
This route crosses to the left side of it and then back to the right higher
up. After the walk, a short 5- step really got my attention. It felt difficult
and awkward. Now I'm scared about the terrain higher, lol...

**P4 5-, 18 m** - A much nicer pitch, all rock and no more grass. Helmut led
up and right on a slabby ramp.

**P5 5-, 30 m** - Continuing on the ramp, I enjoyed some nice moves and a few
hand jams in the crack on the left at an interesting separation between
good grey limestone and rotten, brown and orange rock.

**P6 5, 40 m** - Helmut led up and right on poor rock above steep grassy slopes, then
curved back left and up on satisfying and more sustained grade 5 terrain.

**P7 5, 30 m** - I led up a nice step then into an excellent stretch of climbing
on a steep wall with blocky corners to an overhang, escaped on the right side.

Helmut on the exciting pitch 6.

And again.

**P8 5/5+, 18 m** - Helmet solved the crux of this pitch, right above the
belay, by stemming up a dihedral to sloping holds on a ledge above. After this
he merely had to walk to the left a while to reach the belay.

**P9 6+, 35 m** - I was worried enough about this pitch I left my phone in
Helmut's pack to conserve weight! I tried to leave my camera too, but he said
there are great photo opportunities from the belay stance. Okay, fair enough!
Right away, it is an engaging and sustained pitch. Starting at grade 5, the
difficulty steadily increases to a crescendo at the end. You follow a smooth,
steep ramp, aided by cracks and corners on the left. I found myself liebacking
mostly one direction, but on one occasion I was facing the other way due to
the angle of cracks on the left. It felt like one boulder problem after another,
and the protection was great. The end is tough, because I was liebacking
and the edge for my hands was steadily diminishing. At maximum body tension,
I clipped a bolt far out to the right, then had no idea how to proceed for
the last bit to the anchor. I rested on the rope here. Then I realized
that the bolt being so far right was a kind of signal to follow it around the
corner. And sure enough, I found a few edges for hands and feet there. A couple
of high-steps, and I was at the anchor. It was nice to leave the corner/crack
right before it turned into an offwidth nightmare!

Helmut came up, remembering his previous times here. I got some great pictures
of him climbing. Indeed, it is a special position!

Here you can see that just above that last bolt, on the left, there are some
breaks in the smooth rock -- for hands and feet!

One more shot looking down.


**P10 5+, 35 m** - I led this one too, though I chose a poor technique for the
start! I ended up deep in a chimney/crack, when stemming elegantly on the outside
was called for. Higher, the pitch climbed vertical corners with a few tough
moves, finally reaching a grassy pillar for the belay.

Looking down from partway up the 7th pitch.

Looking across to Treffauer.

**P11 4, 40 m** - Helmut suggested I start belaying on the anchor with the
"Halbmastwurf." It's a good idea, I guess I'm old-fashioned for not having switched
to that style. I'll do that in the future. He climbed a nice vertical edge
that seemed like it should be harder than grade 4, but it went quite nicely.

**P12 5, 40 m** - A very interesting final pitch, starting with solid grade 5
moves straight up cracks on a pillar, then traversing more easily on a ramp leftward.
Difficulties increased again, culminating in the *Balancestelle* ("balance place")
that gives the route a suitably difficult finish. You have to keep your feet
low on a vertical wall despite wanting to bring them up to a ledge. Or maybe I
missed the point of the *Balancestelle*...maybe you are supposed to walk
with no handholds across this ledge!

The final moves before the routebook and the end of the climb...

Happily signing the routebook.

Helmut signed the logbook, and we were able to get the ropes off and switch to
shoes a few meters above this point. "Where is the bus, or taxi, or telepherique?"
said Helmut. I heartily agreed! This was a full climb for me, unused to such
big goals. But it was a great climb and I'd happily do it again.

We chatted with the other guys, who finished their climb, but sadly, didn't get
the "redpoint." They also left a phone at a belay and had to reclimb a hard pitch!

The hike down was long and tricky for tired legs! But we reached the waterfall,
discussing spectrometers, computer programming, and various mountaineering subjects
and places. Helmut knew we should brings 6 euros in coins to pay for beers
retrieved from a cold stream of water at an *alm*. We sat at the *almhaus* as
it began to rain a bit, and drank beer. Good fun!

Soon we were back at the car, with 12 pitches under our belt and something like
1200 meters up and down. Thanks Helmut!
