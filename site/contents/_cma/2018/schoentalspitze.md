It had been a long time since I'd done a good old fashioned ski-tour in
my old stomping grounds, the Sellrain. But now was the time.
The night before, I bought harscheisen (ski crampons). I'd done without them
for a long time, but it can be pretty unpleasant when you really need them!

However, I could have left them at home today. Beautiful fresh powder over
a thick base of snow is what I found. I paid 4 euros at the trailhead,
then followed tracks up the hillside. Higher, I was full of memories
of an occasion last summer when the boys and I climbed the Schöntalspitze
and took an adventurous way down this very valley. I'd forgotten about
that trip! I'll have to write it up...

The day was perfect and cold...snow crystals sparkled in the air for
some reason. I drank some tea in a patch of sun at around 2600 meters
elevation. The altitude already seemed noticeable.

Along with a few others, I made the final awkward switchbacks to a ski depot
on the steep north-east face, about 200 meters below the summit. Clumsy
climbing in boots up loose rocks dusted with powder, then big steps in an
icy trough got me to the summit.

Good stuff!

I returned to my skis and started down, finding it pretty tough at first.
But after a few minutes I was enjoying the powder. For the next 1000
meters of descent I was grinning ear to ear, even though I have no
ski legs, and had to rest often.

The final descent down a steep forest avalanche path through "chop" was
less pleasant, but it worked out okay.

I drove home through Seefeld and along the Walchensee.
