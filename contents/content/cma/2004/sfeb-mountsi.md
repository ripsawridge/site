### Mount Si, Feb 13, 2004
Theron and I hiked up the old trail to Mount Si before work. It was
his first time on that trail. I was worried about missing an important
turn in the dark, but it was light enough for me to see. We had fun
hiking up, then on a whim decided to climb the haystack. Neither of us
had ice axes, but I had "instep" crampons (for icy streets and
sidewalks!) and Theron had his full alpine crampons. It was a good mix
of dry rock and crusty snow. It took two hours to the summit, where we
admired great views of Seattle and Mt. Rainier. Getting down was
tough, the footing on icy ground was kind of insecure without front
points. Theron kicked a few steps for me on the lower section. Anyway,
the "instep" crampons were really great for the icy upper mile of
the trail.  We headed down, exciting about some climbing for the next
day.
