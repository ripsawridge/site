Stephen and Sam
flew in Wednesday night, and we prepared to leave for the mountains
the next day.  We bought a smaller sleeping bag for Sam, and
cobbled together food and equipment as necessary.  Stephen could
hardly sleep from excitement.



I woke the boys up at 6, and we got into our special "mountain
clothes."  In the cold, wet mountains of the Cascades it's
important to stay dry or at least not get too cold when you
are wet.  The boys were used to wearing cotton clothing which
is a complete disaster in the hills.  When wet, cotton looses
all insulating abilities...you may as well take it off!  That's
why synthetic, wool and fleece clothing are required for the
mountains.  We were able to get Stephen and Sam into 90\%
non-cotton clothing which was good enough for me.

In the car, after an hour of driving through urban sprawl we
entered the Mountain Loop Highway with increasing views of
forested hills and roaring rivers.  Stephen wanted to take all
his pictures at once here, while Sam was holding back admirably.
He only had 24 pictures, and was intent on waiting until he
saw something that gave him a heart attack before using one!



We drove by Big Four Mountain, which was very impressive and
picture-worthy.  Soon, we had parked the car across from the
gated road to Monte Cristo and had our packs on.  We began
the mile walk up the dirt road with the boys marveling at
the high valley walls above us and the river below.  The
weather was cloudy but the sun was beginning to burn through.



Stephen and Sam kept up with my fast pace very well, and I
was beginning to worry that they would outlast me...I pictured
myself prostrate on a rock begging to stop for 5 minutes,
while the boys laughingly clambered over me to scale some
overhanging rock wall.  Stoically, I shifted my attention
to endurance rather than speed as the way to win!



We rested at a decomposing bridge over the river, then 
started up the trail proper.  Sam was excited to be in the
real woods, and stabbed the ground energetically with his
trekking pole (this he would do the whole trip...even when
nearly exhausted).  We passed a friendly trail maintenance
crew, and Stephen thanked them for the fine work.  The
hard-working bunch were pleased and surprised by the 
compliment!  



After crossing a raging creek on rocks the trail turned up
the hill very steeply.  Enthusiasm waned as the angle steepened
yet again and the trees closed in.  The forest grew quiet as
we left the river far below.

Sam said his legs hurt and Stephen
was very concerned about our elevation and the elevation of
our destination.  I don't know how many times I said stuff like:
"well, we're at 3400 feet and we need to get to 5400 feet, so
there is quite a ways to go."


"Are we halfway?"

"Well, I don't know in terms of miles, but we still have 2000 feet to climb."

"Oh that's easy," said Sam as he stabbed a decayed log with his
stick.  "We'll be there in 5 minutes."


"Sam, you're stupid, that's more like 6 hours...everyone knows that!"
fumed Stephen.

"Well, no Stephen, assuming a constant grade that's more like 2
hours or less...as long as we keep moving."

Stab stab stab with the stick, went Sam.


I couldn't blame them...this was the boring part, where you can't see
anything and the trail goes up and up.  I enticed them with the
glories of traveling above timberline where you walk through high
meadows looking down to the valleys and across to snowy peaks,
with marmots whistling at you from their boulders.  They couldn't
wait, and soon we made it out of the trees.

We ate lunch at a good view in the sun, thankful for everything.
From here on all I heard from the boys were affirmations that this
was the coolest thing they'd ever done, and thanks so much for letting
us come here and words in that vein which made me feel great.



Actually, Stephen and Sam were excellent hiking partners.  They
carried heavy packs and this was all new to them, but all their
words were of good cheer and amazement at their good fortune.
We made good time and still managed to talk and joke the whole
way.  They were determined but prudent, and Stephen took special
care to make sure our water supplies were always adequate.  They
refused offers on my part to lighten their packs and competed
to carry the water bottle.  They formulated opinions on the trail
that matched my own in each particular.  *Isn't hiking on a
tough trail in the mountains way better than playing "Nintendo"
or watching TV?  How can people drive through these places and
not want to get out and explore them?*

We were all taken with "King Kong's Showerbath,"
a huge multi-level waterfall.  As we progressed up, the afternoon 
clouds drifted in and out mysteriously.
At one minute, we would all be looking at snowy peaks across the
valley, then clouds would block them instantly!  We never managed
to see this happen, it only occurred when we looked away.  
This was extremely beautiful, because each time the clouds
parted they revealed a different scene.  Sometimes the valley below 
would be blocked by a cloud layer, other times forest or rock would be 
visible through holes.  



At about 5 pm, we had to cross a snowpatch just before the basin.
This was very exciting...how often do you see snow in summer?


Gothic Basin itself was glorious in the late afternoon sun.
Heaps of boulders, little creeks, still mountain tarns, and
rocky peaks on three sides.  We set up the tent by a small
lake.  We thought this was Foggy Lake, but found out the next
day that Foggy was a bit higher up.  After a short rest we
scrambled up and over several hillocks on warm pillow-like
rock.  It was after 8 pm when we headed back to the tent for
a dinner of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  It got
colder and we piled into the tent when it was dark.



Here we ran into a huge problem.  Sam had developed a very bad
headache and couldn't sleep.  I had stupidly forgotten to bring
aspirin, so we couldn't really help him.  The poor kid would
try to sleep only to give up in frustration.  After a while,
his stomach hurt too.  Stephen and I were worried and talked
about options.  Should I go back to the car, drive to a store
and return with aspirin?  It started raining.  Sam felt even
worse.  Finally, we realized we'd just have to stick it out.
I stroked Sam's hair, which I hoped would help him fall asleep.
Stephen and I both prayed for Sam to feel better.  After about
2 hours, Sam was finally sound asleep and had no trouble the
rest of the night.  We were so thankful!



One thing to say about this unfortunate experience is how well
the boys handled it.  Stephen was nothing but concerned for
his brother and Sam both appreciated our attempts to help and
bore the pain and frustration when, ultimately, all we could do
was show that we cared.  Again, we were very thankful that
he got to sleep.



The next day we awoke to rain and fog.  No more would we have the
clear skies and warm sun.  We got up and decided to go exploring
despite the bad weather.  We had great fun naming sub-peaks in the 
basin that we climbed.  Sam and I named "Towel Rock" for a beach 
towel near the summit (this was the only "litter" we saw by the way).  
Stephen named our lake "Aqua Lake," I named "Icy Peak" for some ice 
we encountered near the summit.  Our final destination was "Three 
Brave Explorer's Mountain," named for us.  This peak
was fun because we had to climb to a rocky pass, circle another
small lake ("zombie lake...zombies lay in the water and come out
at night!"), cross a snowfield, pass a waterfall, then walk up
a thin ridge.  After this, we looked down on Aqua Lake from a
neat clifftop viewpoint, ate some food then headed back to camp.

At camp the boys took a nap while I guided a fisherman up to
Foggy Lake.  The boys and I had walked almost there, but turned
back before a dubious snowfield.  This lake was indeed Foggy:
I couldn't see the end of it, and icebergs floated here and there.
The fisherman was impressed with the boys ability, as we had done
a hard climb.  We gave him our campsite and said farewell to
Gothic Basin.



Down we went, lunching at King Kong's Showerbath, and zooming through
the forest.  We joked about 
Jimmy Dean Sausage commercials and
laughed all the way down.  On the forest floor, we covered the
half mile to the road as weariness set in.  At the dirt road,
we still had a mile to go, so we had our last rest at the decomposing
bridge.  Sam and I performed a jig, and Stephen said I was weird
for an adult.



The last mile went slowly, and our feet hurt.  Finally, the car!
Stephen was amazed at how good it felt to sit in a real chair, having
forgotten what that was like.  The whole way home, we reveled in
the joy of civilization and air conditioning.  Oh yes, and those of you 
who know the boys can imagine what we ate back in town: Jack in 
the Box tacos...many of them!
