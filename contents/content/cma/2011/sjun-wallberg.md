### Wallberg (not to summit)
<i>June, 2011</i>

I called Josef at about 8:30 pm and asked if he fancied a night hike up Wallberg. "Sure!" he said. We headed out and were walking up the road in the pink light of twilight. We went to the little chapel about 100 meters below the true summit, and figured that was enough. We hung out and watched bats chase moths under the floodlight. On the summit, someone had been having a bonfire. A truck came and took them away, and we headed down too. Good stuff. 800 meters up and down. Didn't take much time as all we carried was one headlamp and an apple to share.
