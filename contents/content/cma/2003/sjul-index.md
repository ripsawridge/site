<h3>Index Climbing, July, 2003</h3>

Theron and I drove out for a small bit of climbing early in the morning.
First we climbed G.M. pitches 1 and 2. Pitch 2 looks so intimidating from the
belay, as it goes up to a roof and underclings to a steep wide crack on the right.
But once you commit to the moves, you find they are all there in a solid (stolid?
(STONKER?)) way. Like me, Theron finished this pitch breathing harder than he
expected to! Now for "Heart of the Country", pitch 3, rated 5.10a. I got a great
nut placement in at the start, made sure I was comfortable and took off for
some semi-insecure finger jams and thin hand jams. I pasted my feet on the golden
face and moved steadily up. When I could get my first real hand jam, I placed a
black Metolius cam. I climbed higher, feeling my legs shake a little bit, but
overall not needing to stop and rest. One more cam placement would protect my
launch into the final overhanging section. But what the crack dishes out in
angle, it gives back with solid jams for hands and feet. One...two...three...four...
I marked time as hands and feet locked in place. I was done! I placed a #3 Camelot
at the top just in case I pitched off on the easy mantle finish. Now I want
to climb "Breakfast of Champions" I wonder how much harder it is?!?


Theron started, and had a really hard time. He doggedly worked the perplexing jams
with withering arms and great displays of strength. It was really good practice
for him, and after lots of work he arrived on top. "I wonder if I'll ever climb
that free?" he mused. "In time...in time," I soothed. We repaired to our duties
near the Sound.
