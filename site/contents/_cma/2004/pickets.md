_Quick Version: Three of us made a 6 day traverse of the Picket Range, blessed by
good weather in mid-August. We hiked in via Big Beaver Creek, then bushwhacked
up Wiley Ridge to reach a camp at the Challenger Glacier. We climbed Challenger
via the standard route, then descended to a camp in Luna Circ. The next day we
climbed Mt. Fury via the North Buttress, camping on the summit snow ridge. Time
to sleep in! A longer-than-expected day saw us reaching Picket Pass in early
evening. We dropped into the circ, then climbed the North Face of Terror,
reaching a camp on slabs below the glacier on the south side of the peak in
early evening. On the last day, we hiked out via Terror Creek to a car we'd
stashed at the trailhead 6 days before._

### Saturday, August 7th

Flashback to 2003. Theron and I gorging ourselves on pizza, still covered
in dirt from the Ptarmigan Traverse, painful sips of Coke on my sunburned
lips. "Let's go to the Pickets next year and climb Challenger, Fury, and
Terror, all via the north faces!" "Yeah right!"

And yet somehow it happened. A year later, along with surprise guest star
Aidan Haley, we were standing at the boat dock waiting for our water taxi
to the Big Beaver trailhead. What am I doing here, I'm too flabby and
timid, I thought! I had been the chief harranger to Travel Light, the
Modern Way, and now I felt dubious looking at our too-small packs.
A few days before, in the attic of Pro Mountain Sports, I convinced
no one but myself that all three of us could fit under the new lightweight
Betamid in a rainstorm. "Yes, it'll work," I beamed, happy to have shaved
a pound from our collective load.

![Saying goodbye to civilization at the boat dock](images/articles/trips/2004/boatdock.jpg)

The water taxi ride was awesome! I was grinning the whole time, just real
pleased by the speed, and how close we seemed to the water. What a contrast
to the slow trudging up the valley we'd soon experience. The boat dropped
us off, and we left the dock with some pomp. Theron nearly slipped on
a bananna peel I was storing on the dock. What hilarity that would have
been!



"Finally on our way!" I began with mock enthusiasm.



"Guys, I'm kinda tired are we almost there?" mewled Aidan.



"I don't mean to be a downer or anything, but could you guys carry my
pack for me?" said Theron in his best "I-don't-mean-to" voice.



We'd been walking for 5 minutes.


*Just as an aside, travelling as a party of three offers some great benefits.
For example, 1 full pot on the stove makes enough hot water for each person's
dehydrated dinner. One rope is sufficient for the climbing. One "roomy-for-two/
crowded-for-three" tent should be enough, as the member with the thickest
sleeping bag can sleep outside. One rack of climbing gear shared among three
packs, and with the right belay device, two followers can climb at once.
Finally, in case of an accident, three people have more options to
effect a rescue. With four members on the other hand, you may want two ropes
for a technical route, two racks of climbing gear, two stoves, and one or
two tents. I must say, three is a great combination, maybe a magical number.*

The day wore on, clouds gradually lifting to show more of a typical
forest valley, which we ached to put behind us. In fact, after a few
miles we lost track of the distance travelled. Aidan felt pretty sure
that the next broad trunk valley on the left was McMillan Creek. My
pace quickened at the idea, but Theron was wary: "I think it just
seems that way, it's better to assume that this valley is a mere
unnamed side valley." Typically, we hadn't brought a map for this 14
mile section of the trip, because it didn't have any "complicated
stuff." I rationalized with the fury of a gymnast: "I'll bet it's
not McMillan Creek too, but if our valley starts turning north soon
after it, then I'll bet it is, and then the pleasure that dare not
speak it's name can be enjoyed soon after: *taking off the boots
 and lying down!*"



At the last minute I left my MP3 player at home, one of those savage
cut-to-the-bone moves you regret later. But I knew Aidan didn't have one and
I thought he might be lonely if Theron and I zombied along in an electric haze, 
failing to hear his questions or jokes. Theron did listen to some radio dramas
as he walked, but managed to hide his private source of distraction from
the endless woods very politely. So we wandered along all day, a great day
mostly, full of promise and apprehension. Needless to say, we passed "McMillan
Creek" four more times!


 We found
Beaver Pass a semi-gloomy place. It is entirely wooded,
and so broad that it seems more like a plateau. Two men squatted in
the low shelter, stove hissing in the damp and chilly evening. Their
possesions were strewn in front of the trail. I was inclined to linger
when I saw a magazine with a disturbing amount of female flesh. I was
saved from a career of deviant woodsmanhood by my friends pressing
forward on the trail. Reaching a suitable forest camp, we made dinner
and chatted with a party of five next door.  I possesed uncanny
awareness of their names and mission, thanks to a phone message left
by one of their party the day before. Sadly that member cancelled at
the last minute, so they remained dubious of my claims. "I know you
guys!" The party broke up soon after.  

 After an amazingly delicious dinner (they would only get better),
we went to sleep.  Aidan and I had super lightweight sleeping bags, so
we sheltered under the Betamid, while Theron slept out comfortably,
dreaming of tiny robots and Martian river-boat pilots thanks to his
radio dramas.  

### Sunday, August 8th

 We woke to the party of four hiking away, hopefully brushing the
dew off the leaves of the entire western slope we had to ascend. They
had lost a member during the night, apparently he dropped his climbing
helmet on the trail and couldn't do without it.  An hour later we
followed, walking back to the shelter and setting off due west into
the woods. Twenty minutes of crashing through the schrubs and the
ground started to tilt upward. We hiked across fallen logs to stay
above the brush, or wended our way through steep forest. There was
remarkably little sign of passage for a popular entry to the range. At
one point we saw and heard folks above us, so we couldn't be too
lost. The slopes steepened, and we pulled on branches to keep going
up. Rocky buttresses dotted the forest and we climbed between
them. Suddenly I was attacked by hornets!  Sting! Sting! STING! I
dropped my pack and slid down the hill, more stings all the while.
Aidan and Theron were above, already shaking their heads
sympathetically. "Oh Michael, man, that sucks" I remember Aidan
saying. I meanwhile, was cursing my head off, and I'm embarassed to
say, bellowing like my ears were being pulled off and fried in a sauce
of cilantro and paprika before my very eyes! The most hilarious moment
for my be-forested audience (including the guys way up the slope, now
gone white with fear) was when I said: 


"Oh god please don't let them sting me again!!"



and after a pause:

*"OOOOOHHHH LORD NO! NO, NOT AGAIN!!!"*


Finally the insectile fury was exhausted, and I could retrieve my pack
and hike up to the guys for four Advil. I had at least *fourteen
stings* on my arms, stomach and back.  Later one of the shelter
squatters with the alluring magazine said I was lucky because I wore
gaitors: he was stung many times himself about the ankles.

![Mount Fury's North Buttress cuts the center of the picture](images/articles/trips/2004/monster.jpg)


For the next hours I appreciated the sympathetic remarks from Aidan
and Theron, but blanched in fear every time a leaf trembled near my
head. And there were a lot of those, because we'd entered the true
bushwhacking section of the ridge. We yarded on bushes for a few
hundred feet, then scrambled up a short rocky outcrop (where Theron
later said he nearly fell. Actually I think he told us right away but
my head was throbbing with bee). Abruptly, we'd reached the open
heathery alpine country! It's great to be surprised by an early end to
difficulties!



Here we chatted with the party of four, taking some pictures and
laughing about the bees, and my blood-curdling screams that may in
time make this patch of forest legendary. Maybe I can figure in a
ghost story one day.


 It was suddenly a magnificant hike in high country, repleat with
stunning views of Luna Peak and glimpses of The Mount Fury. Grinning
foolishly, we hiked to a sharpened ridge crest and followed a
sidehilling trail around on the south. We crossed several basins on
scree, talus or heather. Thirst led us down to a beautiful tarn with
bubbling stream.  We lazed here for over an hour, perhaps too long,
because we thought that Eiley Lake was just over the next rise. We
descended steeply into another basin and climbed up ingthe other
side. Reaching a brushy cliff, we hiked up into a fiasco that
seperated us into two groups: me hanging from a cliffside tree, and
Aidan and Theron working their way up then down a gully to Eiley
Lake. I had found a passable way down to the lake and thought Theron
was hiking up to get Aidan and bring him my way, but Theron thought I
was just fooling around on a dubious cliff and would eventually join
them. "*Where are they?*" I fumed. "*What the hell is he
doing?*" my friends fumed. Finally I hiked up to catch them, only
to end up 400 feet above them, now sitting at the lake. I was on an
impressive cliff, and unable to hear the shouted commands (there is a
broad gully about 100 feet below the crest of the cliffed-out ridge
you can take down). I finally went back to my tree and lowered myself
down a steep gully.  


I was a pretty crabby
apple for the rest of the day. Theron and Aidan were really patient with me.
One of my bright ideas was to cross slopes 300 feet below Wiley Lake and
reach the Challenger Glacier without having to climb the peak west of
Wiley Lake. Sure I was right, I grumbled all the way up to the lake,
in some perfect storm of exhaustion and irritation. Once at the lake
however, I had to concede how beautiful it was, with icebergs calving
in from the unnamed glacier on the west.  In the early evening, we crossed
the glacier and gained a pass left of the peak. Crossing a steep snowfield
on the other side, we emerged on sun-baked rocky slopes 400 feet above
the vast Challenger Glacier, relieved to find a straightforward way down to
a camp on rock slabs. Like dogs circling three times before lying down,
we agonized over the perfect camp spot, finally finding an excellent
combination of flat rock with a burbling stream next door. Theron made
his bed in the "playpen," a rock house with square walls. Aidan and
I slept in the "foyer." I gradually recovered my ability to laugh after
a rough afternoon. We were excited to leave the packs at camp and finally climb
something after two days of rough travel.


### Monday, August 9th



Aidan and I didn't set up the tent, so we shivered in the wee hours. The
sun eventually warmed us. Aidan had some tremendous blisters, and they were
consuming our duct tape supply. I had one on the fourth toe of each foot,
and they healed mid-trip thanks to wrapping the offending toe in duct tape.




The glacier was very easy to climb, and we were soon unroping to scramble across
rocks to the base of the summit block. The shelter squatters were rappelling,
having really enjoyed the summit. They had a big day left ahead of them,
planning to make it back to Beaver Pass by evening.  Theron led the short rock
pitch to the summit, clipping a few fixed pitons for the solid and fun
climb. Aidan and I followed, then we scrambled up the amazingly exposed summit
block. Aidan felt kind of nervous, having been away from high exposed mountains
for many months.  But once securely positioned, we could rave about the
outrageous Luna Circ below us, gibbering madly about our proposed route down to
Lousy Lake and where we should climb onto the North Buttress of Fury. One rappel
got us down, and then just 30 minutes of stomping down the snow saw us
cat-napping at camp.  Time to pack up and go!



We were excited dropping into Luna Circ. The way mostly seemed pretty obvious.
We hiked easily down most of "Challenger Arm," a broad rock-and-heather
buttress, and instinctively began traversing right across unpleasant scree
after descending a few hundred feet. If you don't do this, you'll end up
in a welter of steep brush and waterfalls (to engage in a bit of fantasy
history, there is an old mine at about 5400 feet with an entrance in
a deep, obvious gorge, cleverly hidden behind a waterfall. Presumably a
lower ledge has fallen away because the only access is now from above, and
even that might require rappels. Gaspar Peroux, who trapped the upper
Big Beaver in the 1880s knew the squatters, describing them as "menonites.").



Gently descending, and crossing several gullies, we entered a zone of
thrumming waterfalls, where careful route choice led us through only
one semi-exciting crossing at the base of a fall with a swirling pool.
From the opposite bank Aidan and I watched Theron cross, besoaking his
left foot on a quick recovery. Now we turned straight down a ramp of scree and
brush, making for a lake at the base of a huge moraine coming from Swiss Peak.
Once in the morainal debries, we picked our way through huge boulderfields
and across sandy slopes, already disappointed that we couldn't get to the
rushing water we heard far under the boulders. We reached a striking
flat ancient lakebed that would make a perfect camp. Still hundreds of feet
above the other lake, we didn't want to drop any further, so we dropped our
packs here and went searching for water. Theron correctly predicted a walk
down the valley 10 minutes would be fruitful, and soon we were drinking our
bellyful where cold water finally emerged from a crushing debt of rock.

Thanks to a welter of dead twigs on the lakebed, we were able to build a small
warming-fire, for the sun set early below the deep circ walls, and we felt
pretty alone below Fury. The grumbling glaciers interrupted our conversations,
like parents reminding of unpleasant facts. We'd decided to climb the right
side of the buttress in the morning, but there were some obvious danger points
that we would have to skirt quickly. "The Mudslide" was one such place, where
white snow was stained black-brown by an hourly stream of effluvium from the
upper mountain. One scenario predicted an actual crossing of it high up, but
whatever we did, we'd probably be closer to its furies of flying rock than we wanted to be.
We savored every bite of dinner, it was so delicious. Freeze-dried meals
get a bad rap. Something I learned just before this trip is to get dishes with
noodles and not rice, because sometimes the rice doesn't cook enough and tastes
unpleasant.


  Handy tip: Theron, exasperated with the bulky size of his dehydrated
  food packets, took a bold step that Aidan and I followed. He threw
  away the plastic outer package for all but 2 of his meals, instead
  storing them tightly in ziplock bags. With these meals you let them
  cook in the outer packaging, and he was able to re-use that each
  night. This strategy cut the size of our feed bags down
  considerably, and was perfectly safe.


After dinner we sat by the fire, sipping Tequila Blanco, thinking
about the next day.  "If we get up this mountain, we'll have done the
hardest climb." "I just can't wait to be on top looking down at this
valley."


We made an Offering of Fire to the God of Mount Fury, throwing a shot
of Tequila onto the suddenly-blazing fire in a gesture of
appeasement. All of us had somehow become very superstitious. If Aidan
said "I'll bet this good weather will hold for the whole trip!"
Theron and I would knock on a piece of wood, or our head, then knock
on some rock and say "knock on wood, knock on granite."  These
knocks had to be done immediately to counter the possibility that the
hopeful statement would anger something listening!



Finally the fire died, and we crawled off to bed. The avalanches of
rock and ice rumbling above us became part of my dream. In this dream,
the three of us were in a spacious house still below the face, filled
with classical music and adults debating whether or not they should
let us climb. Still determined to climb, I munched on *hors
d'oeuvres* and grew worried looking for Theron and Aidan who always
seemed to be in another room. It was getting late...


### Tuesday, August 10th


We packed quickly in the cold saying goodbye to our friendly little
camp. A short scramble down the moraine got us to frozen snow beneath
the face, where we put crampons on and roped up. Crossing a crevasse,
we climbed a snow ramp for several hundred feet as the sun touched
slopes high above. The ramp ended, and I set off to lead a steep slab
pitch. First I tried in my boots, which was too scary so I switched to
rock shoes, half-hanging awkwardly from a nut on a sloping ledge. I
think I got one more piece of pro, then a full 45 meters with
nothing. It was kind of a sobering lead! Theron and Aidan seemed to
fly up it so I wondered if my head was just in a bad place. Aidan then
led us down a rocky ramp to a better place to turn back up
again. Since I had rock shoes on, I set off on a fun, but somewhat
mind-bending pitch.  "Ah, specimen 4th class" I said, climbing the
firm, polished rocks of a watercourse.  About halfway up I wished for
some protection, but never found any. The angle steepened, and I
concentrated on moving very carefully. For the first time we were
seeing what it's like climbing with a 30 pound pack. My toes seemed to
bore through the rock shoes.  By the top of the face, I was mentally
tired, wondering if it would be "free-solo" pitches like this all
the way up. I rounded a corner and set a belay in a gully. This was
good news, we had seen this gully the day before, and knew it led to a
snowfield we could take back left to get on the buttress! Again, Aidan
and Theron raced up.



We sat for a while drinking water from a stream. Suddenly there was a
reverberating *BOOM!* and a whirling meteor was suspended in the
sky above us. "*Oh shit, rock ROCK!*"  we tried to crab quickly
to the right, dropping boots and gear all the way. 
*BAM!* The rock shattered near the stream, near where we
were sitting. Tiny shrapnel rocks pricked my skin and clattered
against my helmet.



Even now, months later, that image of a cannonball whirling high above is vivid.


Any chance to relax was over, we packed up and got our crampons
on. Theron set a brutal pace up steep snow. There was no talking, just
one goal - to get out of the path of the rockfall and gain the
crest. We looked up often, scanning for skittering land mines or
showers of radioactivity. At the top of the snowfield, we could look
across to the source of the rockfall: a hideous maw which drained the
middle and upper mountain.  I ventured closer to get some water
because we would need it, and then felt pretty safe under an overhang
where we would begin climbing to the buttress crest. Setting off in
the lead again, I led along corners and ledges for about 4
ropelengths. I remember a difficult move getting over a chockstone in
a gully, wildly saying "I think that was 5.10!" I'm sure it was
really 5.7 with a heavy pack. Going around a corner, I struggled up a
messy moat between rock and ice, nearly freezing my left hand. "I
think you guys can go around to the left of the ice field," I said,
not wishing the experience on my friends.  Another hundred feet saw me
belaying at a tiny saddle, frustratingly close to the buttress crest
but not quite. "Can we say WOOO now?" I asked Aidan. Straining to
look around the corner he said "no, not quite, we need to climb
higher to reach the crest."  "Damn!" said Theron.

Theron now climbed an elegant corner/crack, raving about the great
rock. "No fair!" I whined, tired from my battles with protectionless
slabs and grunge. "Hee hee!" he responded.  Our mood lifted, we knew
we were safe from rockfall now. Knock on wood. Knock on granite.



Theron reached a puzzle, and set a belay. Steep rock without ready
protection convinced him there must be a better way. We all looked to
the left, where by downclimbing 30 feet we could gain a steep
watercourse to climb back up. No one was sure, but thanks to my
previous watercourse lead I was eyeing the rock above. The
difficulties looked short. "Let's just climb this guys!"  "Okay, if
you're sure...BE SAFE!"



It was black, near-vertical, licheny rock, but there were hidden
crimper hand holds, and an occasional jam crack. I moved slowly,
eventually finding some decent gear placements, which I doubled up.
There was an ocean of air below, and two worried faces. "Here I
go..." I jammed and liebacked to a higher stance, then moved left for
less lichen. Another set of careful moves saw the angle easing, and
soon I was scrambling up to a belay. "WOOOO! WOOOO! WOOO!" Even
though I wasn't truly on the crest, it seemed a find time to use the
WOOs. Theron and Aidan followed, muttering that the watercourse would
have been easier. Humpf. It seems I've gotten a reputation for wiley
foolishness!



But we really were at the crest (finally), and Aidan led us up
stunningly exposed, solid, easy rock for several rope lengths. This
was the season of smiles. *"I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO COME IN ON SUNDAY
TOO, IT'S NOT A HALF-DAY OR ANYTHING!!"* I shouted up, one of my
favorite lines from "Office Space." *"THANKS DAD, WE'RE FINE!"*
responded Theron, using a cherished line from "K2." With good
weather, and the difficulties below us, we had earned the fun climbing
here, and just relished it. I lay my head against the rock in thanks.



  One good thing about climbing with a heavy pack, is that you
  spend a little longer in any particular place.  If travelling light,
  this section would be a blur, but as it was I remember it as 3-4
  distinct pitches.  Theron made an exciting lead at one point,
  deciding to traverse around a tower rather than over the top.
  "Where did he go?" said Aidan, 20 feet ahead of me on an
  increasingly delicate traverse. Overhangs appeared above us and a
  steep drop below meant that Theron had been forced into following
  one possible path. He found good protection from slings around horns
  of rock. Finally we emerged from the traversing tunnel, and Aidan
  nearly choked to death raving about how cool a picture of me would
  look from his stance.  Apparently the overhang above and below,
  combined with a scene of the tiny lake below and me clinging to a
  hand traverse with an oversized pack made for a picture of high
  drama. Did he take a picture then? NO.  Theron took one from above,
  and it came out rather tame.

  If you see a good picture, go ahead and take it. Or don't tell
  anyone about how great it would have been!





We climbed to a tower which required a rappel. I saw a way to
downclimb, then crabbily gave Theron a hard time for setting a rappel
where the rope got stuck. Even as I bitched about it, I wondered why I
was so irritable. I realized I was pretty stressed out from the scary
pitches in the morning.  I felt this outsized responsibility for
Theron and Aidan and worried that I was recklessly leading them into
danger. But when Aidan pointed out what fun we were all having, and
how he wasn't worried about anything, I could get a better perspective
on things.  This experience of getting stressed out and being short
with your partners was (I think!) new to me, and taught me something
about my comfort zone, and my natural reaction when it gets stretched
a lot.  Coming out of that frame of mind was about relinquishing
control, recognizing that the kind of complete control I sought over
our situation was at best an illusion. This put my head in such a
better place, and for the rest of the trip, I could appreciate how
much of our success and safety came from our blend of skills and
attitudes. I could relax and know that I could coast on my friend's
abilities, trusting that they would lead me safely.  It was kind of a
spiritual realization for me, and as time went on, this personal
struggle becomes a more important result of our trip.



Somewhere in here I cracked Aidan up when Theron was climbing above,
and we espied an intriguing ice cave in a glacier below. It was
enormous, with a level floor that led into blackness. "If I were a
Warlock Aidan, I would live in that cave, and fly out of there every
night to terrorize children all over the world!"



"Why do you talk that way Michael? What planet are you from? Only you
would say that!" he said.



From then on my apropos comments had to be carefully thought out so as
to get such a great reaction. Indeed, all of us were inventing little
characters to entertain us in the hours and days ahead. Aidan mimicked
a Frenchman, naturally disdainful of Americans. Theron had a grizzled
prospector character, refined from last year's Ptarmigan Traverse,
still suspicious of anyone taking his "bottle." I fleshed out a
character Theron invented, a 1955 camp counselor type, full of
bluster, smelling of wood-chips and flannel. His dark secret was
increasingly ill-hidden, finally bursting forth monstrously as we
descended "Stump Hollow."  The comraderie on this trip was the best
I'd ever experienced, we almost always had something to smile and
laugh about.



Higher on the buttress, I led us slowly up the last section of rock,
two low 5th class pitches in shallow gullies and chimneys that gained
a rubble field. The sun was baking us and slowing us down.  Above this
we climbed through a "rabbit's ears," and switched into boots for a
long walk up boulders to the base of the snow arete. We decided to be
extra careful on it, due to tiredness and huge exposure on either
side. I led for an easy rope length, then Theron took us up 100 meters
of steeper snow and ice, laboriously kicking steps and creating
handholds with his ice axe. "Way to go Theron, you are...how shall I
say...THE MAN!"



After this, in my excitement, I foolishly climbed straight up a
buttress that got hard, then hard to reverse, then I was committed to
top out. I untied the rope so Aidan and Theron could find a better
way. "*Goodbye!*" I said dramatically. But soon enough we were
back together again, picking our way on the south side of this
buttress to reach the final rubble slopes. The sun had already gone
down, and we reached the summit at twilight.


"That was a hard won peak" I said to vigorous agreement. "Frickin
hard won." More vigorous agreement.  "Wow man, wow" Aidan said to
more general agreement by the party.  "Yeah I'm tired - wanna make
something of it?" said Theron inexplicably!  It went on like this for
some time.  "Damn!" I said, to sum up.



Where to sleep? Nothing looked good. That is, until we saw the
level-topped summit snow ridge: a perfect place for the tent! "As
long as you don't mind sleeping inches from a 3000 foot drop down the
north face, go for it, I'm going over here instead!" said
Theron. While Aidan and I got comfortable in the tent, Theron dropped
his gear on a flat slab 50 feet below. He returned and graciously
attended the stove while Aidan and I searched for bits of duct tape
for his blisters. "I'm so screwed guys" he said, and other comments
in a similar vein.  The blisters were bad, as they were every night. I
offered to wear Aidan's boots for the rest of the trip, as we had a
similar shoe size and my feet were a-ok so far. This ended up helping
quite a bit, but painful damage was done, and wouldn't have a chance
to heal until getting home. We really felt for him. At least another
delicious hot meal was being delivered, and we could lose ourselves in
it. "DAMN THAT'S GOOD!!!"



A shot of Tequila all around, and one for Fury. She showed us her power, but was not unkind to us. What a feeling
of satisfaction, what a warm glow in the belly it was to see the stars come out from her summit.


### Wednesday, August 11th


Theron was up at dawn snapping pictures as usual. "I'm glad someone's
doing it" was the reaction of the tentbound.  Laying in the tent
until hot sun warmed us thoroughly was a great luxury. We felt really
deserving of a rest day, so we drew out every process. We melted
several quarts of water from snow and very gradually changed from
people who lie on pads in their socks into booted sentinels, waiting
for someone to finish last minute chores.  "Okay!"



Wanting to avoid steep ice slopes, we descended a gully leading
southwest, then traversed south below walls. When things got steep, we
jumped back over the ridge onto the snow, traversing and descending
easily. Before long, we found a serious difficulty. A seemingly
vertical wall of snow blocked our path, and other choices looked just
as bad. We could try descending a rotten, protectionless rock ridge,
or go down a glacier to the east for thousands of feet and face a long
climb back up to Outrigger Peak, our next goal. We all shuddered at
the first choice, and the second might have been palatable, if we
could see the whole way. But as it was, it seemed like an icefall
might block the way below us.



So I asked Theron for a belay, and set off kicking steps down the steep snow. I had lugged a third tool all the
way from home just for this kind of impasse, and felt it was time to use it. We had two ice screws and
one picket. The
angle was probably 50 degrees, and the slope almost all ice. I saw that we could make it down to a level bench
a few hundred feet below. 

"Okay here is the plan--"

"You're crazy!" said Theron.

"Okay here is the plan, I lower you and Aidan from this picket
belay. You place one ice screw 100 feet down, then build a belay 200
feet down with the other ice screw. I'll downclimb with the two
tools. We repeat until we reach the bench."

And by golly it worked! It took three full rope lengths to do it, and
the angle never let up all the way down.  We did get a region of snow
which was easier on the calves, but that ran out after a while. It
took a long time, especially as the sun was baking us and we were long
out of water. On pitch two Aidan had to lead down with the two tools,
nearly freezing his hands because he left his gloves in his pack. Also
Theron had a stressful downclimb because Aidan didn't want to weight
the ice screw belay in order to just lower him. I made out best of
all, because I was wearing Aidan's extra stiff boots.

At the bench we drank a lot of water, thankfully there were a lot of
streams weeping from the ice. We were a little crestfallen, because we
realized we had to keep downclimbing. A low angled ramp to the col
with Outrigger Peak had proved to be an illusion. It was the same
drill as before. One kind of funny thing happened. I had just
downclimbed to Theron and Aidan's belay, and continued down top-roped
for the next pitch. "Stay away from those crevasses Michael,"
somebody said. Hmpf, I thought. "I actually like them guys, the lower
lip provides a great level place to rest my calves."

"Anyway guys this tells me where the edge of the--"
punch. through. oops. "--crevasses are!" I recovered nicely, but
they were chuckling with too much satisfaction to notice. Anyway, a
few more hops and I was on mundane terrain below the steep ice and
crevasses. When we were all together, I made a traversing path up to
Outrigger col where we happily unroped and put crampons away. "If I
don't see another ice face like that in my life I'll be fine!" said
Theron, or something to that effect. Vigorous agreement by party.


  I'm really glad we brought a 3rd tool along. I was thinking of just
  that kind of situation. Of course, from Outrigger Peak we could see
  that the long trip down and around to the east would have been
  successful, so it undercuts my point a little bit. But with a 3rd
  tool an entire party could get up or down something that might
  otherwise stymie them. Sure, the leader could take another member's
  ice axe, but in an environment where belays are somewhat insecure, I
  wouldn't want to leave one member without any axe. On this
  particular trip I was more worried about bergschrunds and moats
  seperating snow from rock than anything else, and that's why I
  brought it.  We didn't use the tool for that, but it came in real
  handy for this unexpected "ice wall."


We scrambled to the summit of 
Outrigger Peak for a great late
afternoon view of the area. It had taken most of the day to get here
from the summit! We felt we were getting our asses kicked. "There's
always sumtin'!" and "it never ever lets up!" were typical
comments. "What do you think we'll find on the descent to Picket
Pass?" I said.



"Rappels, scary downclimbs and cliffs!" said Aidan. 



But it was pleasant enough. In fact the scenery was fantastic. For the
first time we could walk without extreme care, and look around at the
vertigo-inducing walls. The angles were crazy, and the 70 millimeter
pano-vision boggled the mind. We did eventually come to a cliff, and a
very tattered rappel sling.  We left a new sling here, and slid
down. No sooner did we put the rope away, but there was a knife-edged
ridge to cross. This was easy to climb and a good bit of sport. We
continued for another 500 feet on gradually friendlier terrain of
boulders, heather and stunted trees to Picket Pass, a broad but narrow
divide with tarns and boulder-strewn hillocks.



We were frazzled, wondering how we could possibly muster the energy to
climb Mt. Terror the next day.  This day was supposed to be mostly a
"rest day," but aside from sleeping in a few extra hours, we'd been
on stressful and strenuous terrain the whole time. At least we had
fresh water - someone had piled rocks at the base of a snowfield such
that it made a little pool where we could fill bottles. In the hour or
two before sunset we managed to recoup a surprising amount of
energy. Theron reveled in the "Lost World" look of McMillan Creek
Cirque. He said "I wouldn't be surprised to see a brontasaurus raise
it's head in that patch of light green!" I had to agree. It was a
wonderful and almost plausible thought.


After some bathing in pools (I just got my feet wet), we ate another
amazing dinner. Our freeze-dried food choices had been excellent,
every night was a feast of calories and not a drop went to waste. We
talked about skipping Mount Terror and climbing out via the
Ottohorn-Himmelhorn Col. I was willing to do that because of Aidan's
blisters, and so was Theron. But he said he really did want to climb
Terror if it was possible, and I agreed. Aidan was also willing. We
also thought it wouldn't be that much harder (that is, both ways
would seem hard!). It was also an open question as to how we'd get
down into the cirque. Directly below us were vertical cliffs.



We slept well, although something furry trundled across my hand at one
point, waking me up completely. One of the few disadvantages to having
a tent without a floor.


### Thursday, August 12th


In the morning, we packed quickly and impatiently hiked up a hill to
find the way down from the pass. We began stumbling down a natural
way. Options began to close off in steep dense brush and trees,
sending us further to the right. Eventually we were hanging onto a
tree and peering down a cliff. Picking our way down a little further,
we threaded the rope around a tree for a rappel. After this, we could
carefully scramble into a gully which led us to polished slabs. Unused
to Aidan's stiff boots on slabs, I switched into rock shoes.  Theron
lowered his pack down a cliff on a rope, and soon enough we were all
assembled by a stream.  "Well, we made it down that!"



We crossed polished rocky slabs riven with streams, stopping to drink
a few times. It was a great feeling to have made it down from the
Pass. We could sit and drink water in the sun, looking back at Fury,
and casting glances over our shoulder to Terror (The Looming Terror!).


We entered a zone of hard snow and occasional crevasses, stopping to
put on crampons and rope up. Gaining the buttress was difficult,
because the snow became breakable plates of ice with black holes
underneath. I was in the lead, and rather overcautious, stopped to
carefully remove crampons once I made it onto a gray slab. While
Theron gave me a fixed belay from an ice screw I made low-5th class
slab moves that felt much harder due to the black moat under the
hanging prongs of hard snow. But after only 15 feet I reached a ledge
where I could place some gear and bring my friends up. Aidan was
especially chilled, as a draft was whistling down the couloir he
waited in. He set off eagerly in the lead, in search of sun. I wore
his pack for most of the climb, really noticing the weight difference,
thanks, I believe to his heavier, bulkier boots. Maybe he had an extra
shirt or something too!



I was really elated at this point, because the two biggest worries I had for the
trip were difficulties getting onto the Fury and Terror buttresses. Colin Haley
had soloed this route in July and said something like "better hurry before
melt-out renders it inaccessable!" Now that these worries were over, we had
so much to smile about!

Aidan led us across a waterfall coming from the Kitty snowfield directly
above us. We covered hundreds of feet on fun, easy terrain. The rock became
very clean and enjoyable once we outflanked the Kitty on the left. It started
to remind us of the Dolomites, with few cracks, but solid jointing. Aidan took
gear from us and continued for another long simul-climbing pitch. From a
belay in mid-face Theron took over and climbed a clean dihedral we rated 5.6.
At the next belay he was tempted straight up into dubious terrain. Realizing
this, he downclimbed about 50 feet and set off rightward to gain a shallow
rib that we thought would get us past steep, concave-looking terrain straight
above. Perhaps this is why in various route topos the climbing line makes
a gentle curve to the right.



Theron belayed at the rib and I set off upward on suddenly licheny rock.
Scritching and crunching the black lichen-flowers, I reveled in the loneliness
of our location. So far as we knew, the nearest people were days away. We
listened to icefalls in these empty mountains and climbed. My toes were
boring holes in my rock shoes again, but I'd finally gotten used to climbing
with the overnight pack. It was certainly lighter now too!



Aidan and Theron arrived and I set off again, having to really pay
attention as ledges became further apart and the holds got
smaller. The shallow rib had become more defined, and at once was too
steep to climb directly. I knew I'd have to traverse left into a
darkened chimney, but each spot I surveyed reminded me of unhappy
endings. So I kept climbing up, hand jamming and generally getting
into more strenuous terrain. My gear was running low. I finally made a
choice to traverse left where I was rather than risk getting treed
like a cat. "Watch me here ye scurvies!" I cried. Flat edges for
fingertips provided a way, with feet smearing on blank sections of
rock. With 10 more feet to go and no protection since the rib I
distinctly felt the possibility of falling.  I got very quiet, the
blood pulsed in my ears, and sound dropped away. I couldn't hang here
forever.



Moving, because I had to. Quiet, because the mountain demanded it. 

A brief glimpse of surety, and I was across in the chimney,
all chatty: "Wow that was hard I think that was like, 5.10a!" On the climb up
from the belay, Theron didn't like the look of the traverse, so he
climbed a bit higher where, wouldn't you know it, there was an easier ledge
to follow. Aidan came across and down-rated the traverse to 5.8+. "Still!" I 
beamed. 

We were at an awkward stance in the chimney. Aidan led off right above my
head for a 60 meter pitch that got back onto the licheny rib. He described
the terrain as easy but steep and somewhat loose. Theron and I
followed the chimney then gladly climbed out of it back onto the rib. Aidan
extricated himself from the belay and took off again, leaving us to glance
around at the walls surrounding our precarious ledge. Another long pitch 
led to gradually rounding terrain, and we came into the sun and more open air.
Now we scrambled up a long rib with snow leading up to a local crest.



"Lunchtime!" We hung out here a good while, definitely feeling like we'd
finished the hard parts of the climb. The drop down to the Degenhardt
Glacier was amazing, it looked incredibly steep and forbidding. Aidan had his
eye on some steep cracks right of the crest above us, but I was like "no way
man!" Luckily I found a cairn and an improbable path out on the cliff above
the Degenhardt to a belay ledge. Theron led off above here, finding as he
so often does, a host of sturdy blocks and horns to sling for protection.
I led off from a belay right of the crest for a spectacular pitch. "This
is awesome, you dog!" I heard Aidan cry below. After leading so many mungy
or creepy pitches, I had plucked the golden goose! Solid jamming and stemming
in a chimney, good rock that it's a delight to smear your feet on with
hands on solid granite edges. We climbed together for a few hundred feet
until we could walk to a point where the ridge steepened again. 
From a roomy ledge, Aidan belayed me on the final pitch, which looked intimidating
but actually was festooned with hidden solid holds on the most knife-edged crest
of the trip. I constructed a belay in the full glare of sun, with a
new and novel view of south slopes at my feet. It was a false summit.



We scrambled down and happily dropped our packs at a notch. In the race to the
true summit I fell behind, but couldn't wipe the smile from my face. Really
solid and fun scrambling got us to a pile of big blocks that marked the spot.
It must have been late afternoon, say 5:30 pm, when the sun is full on from
the southwest. We took pictures and wanted to stay, but a last look at
shady McMillan Creek Cirque had to suffice. Suddenly stiff and sore, we reversed
our steps to the notch carefully. Easier scrambling for 500 feet led down to
a rappel station above a deep notch. I slid down the rope, wondering about
the direction to take. We could only go 100 feet, and I couldn't find a station
around. I got out some slings and made an anchor at some stacked blocks, hoping
that one more rappel would be enough to reach the snow at the base of the
cliff. Despite my nervousness, the rope did just reach a crumbly gully
behind a tower, and scrambling brought me to snow. Theron was especially glad
to be down from the stacked-block belay!



Hoping to just walk down the gully to the glacier on the south, we were
unpleasantly surprised by the unfriendly footing. Any rocks to brace
yourself with would go hurtling down, and shelves of pebbles that might
hold a foot were merely thin layers over slabs that would rocket away
like Tiddily-Winks when relied upon. "There is a whole science to slopes
like this" I mused unhelpfully. Sticking together for safety from bounding
rocks, we came to an abrupt cliff where a chockstone caused the way to
overhang. Digging beneath piles of rocks we found a rappel anchor. 
Aidan started laughing. Still, we threaded the rope and carefully slid down,
wary for sudden shifting blocks waiting to get us. Below this spot, it was
a bit easier, and Aidan went ahead to find the best way. Fifteen minutes
later we were shouting insults at the unfriendly gully, and posing for pictures
where we made obscene gestures at it. But mostly we were happy to be down,
and soon selected a campsite on slabs beneath the peak with running
water. 



As the sun sped towards the horizon, Aidan hilariously submerged his whole
body in a pool, appearing to be striken by seizures mid-way. There were many
hi-jinks to laugh about, and the delight we took in dinner was almost absurd,
groaning and moaning over the tiniest bite! Jeez, we had to get out of here,
huh?



"Why don't we cancel the climb of the Chopping Block?" I said.

"YA THINK?!?" cried Aidan.

"I don't know guys, let's see how we feel in the morning" mused Theron.

"Oh no he di'int!" said Aidan, head vigorously rotating about neck.

"Talk to the hand!" was all I had to say thenceforth on the subject.

We stayed up late, looking out at Triumph and Despair, fittingly close together,
and began our goodbyes.
 

### Friday, August 13th


In the morning we were slow, tired. It was hard to muster energy to do basic
chores like putting my sleeping bag away. We wandered around, getting water,
discussing the way ahead, and finally pooling our food together and eating
everything that didn't seem necessary. I think we kept one Power Bar in
case of emergency. Finally descending slabs, we got seperated when Theron and
I didn't want to follow a steep slab Aidan scurried down. 30 minutes later
we were together again on scree slopes leading to the Chopping Block. A very
long mile traversing above the Crescent Creek Basin led to a notch
between The Chopping Block and Mount Degenhardt. The Chopping Block looked
so close, and after a rest I was a little sad that we weren't going to
climb it. But once I started moving again I realized I was pretty darn
tired!



Easily descending the slabs east of the Chopping Block, we were in a
neighborhood called
"Stump Hollow." We ventured to the east side to look
down the Barrier. It was very steep, and Terror Creek looked and
sounded like a faraway equatorial river. We found a trail leading down
through heather, brush and forest. It was a very efficient descent, but
finally we lost the trail for good, and went for several hundred vertical
feet through a region of brush and cliffs that took great effort. We were
always traversing east back to the crest of the Barrier. It seemed like
we'd drop 100 feet, and then be 300 feet away from the Barrier. I led
frustrated companions over logs, through spider webs and thrashing
brush into a sweaty, tropical jungle. 



Regaining the trail, we grew crafty about finding and keeping it. It was
good practice for a mindset that would serve us well on the rest of the
descent. The leader would lose the trail, announce it, and one of the
followers would pick it up again and lead. Thusly we swarmed down to
a level section of the ridge suspiciously marked with flagging. "Want to
rest here?" I said.



We dropped our packs and sweated our heads off. "I'm just sitting still!"
cried Theron in disgust. Eventually we cooled down, and although the
trail continued down the ridge, we decided our altimeters were way off, and
we should descent to the east right here thanks to some fairly recent flagging.
We were told about a baseball card or photograph taped to a tree, which
we never saw. It's natural to worry at this point, because going the wrong
way can lead to troublesome cliffs and steep jungle. Pink flagging tape on
trees can be helpful, but we've all been led astray by it too. 



Happily, the way was good. It was very steep, and the trail was easily lost.
But searching always rewarded us. Once we had to spend 15 minutes re-finding
the way. Eventually, we wore crampons on steep pine-needle terrain. After 
an hour and a half, we were overjoyed to reach Terror Creek!



I strode to the creek to see the tail end of a woods drama: Aidan had fallen
in, losing his water bottle, and was now clinging to a rock mouth wide
open and startled! Theron helped him out, and we felt really lucky. The
river was raging, with falls and choking logs all around. As Aidan dried
off, we laughed about the water bottle, because the only one we had left
now was mine.


*The water bottle story: Days ago, on Wiley Ridge Theron lost the nipple to
his Camelback water bag. He attempted to use duct tape or other materials
to plug the leak, but these all led to frustration. No matter! I had an extra
rolled up Platypus 1 quart bottle, which Theron happily used until losing
it when it fell into a crevice he couldn't reach on Mt. Fury. Then he got
by on Aidan's water or my own. Finally, with Aidan's lost to the raging
waters of Terror Creek, mine was the only one left!*





I made waterproof booties out of a garbage bag to keep Aidan's feet dry, and
we continued on. Very soon we'd lost the trail in dense thorny brush, and
floundered around looking for the way. Eventually giving up, we plunged
through the alder, sidehilling awkwardly above the creek. I thought I'd
seen a section of trail and complained loudly about not getting the chance
to go look for it. At that moment a bee stung me. "RUN!" I nearly shoved
Theron off the trail in my panic to escape another bee incident! Finally
I tripped and wailed miserably for a moment. "Okay I've hit bottom," I
thought. 



That done, I could now zombie on for hours, and indeed we did, gamely crossing
rib after rib in tiring effort. When we regained the trail I know we all
stuck to it like butter! Theron emerged first at the flat spot
that marked the end of the Goodell Creek trail, letting out a "WHOOP!" 



We walked for a few miles, then Aidan and Theron saw a place to get down
to the creek for a bath. I took Theron's MP3 player and listened to a radio
drama about a paroled prisoner who sees pink elephants. I admired a huge
landslide on the other side of the river, the apex a few hundred feet up
the slope. Then I came upon a tent structure built right by the water.
It was draped in ribbons and prayer flags, and in front of the tent was a
human of indeterminate sex, lying with eyes closed on a sort of bier! I
stared open-mouthed but passed quietly. My puzzlement gradually gave way
to excitement because I knew the car was close. Yes!


The gang of two arrived, also dumbfounded by the river site.
Aidan said the figure opened it's eyes and looked at him briefly. They took
a wrong turn and stumbled into a campground where several similarly dressed
figures explained that they were part of a church group. 


Aidan retrieved a dime he'd placed under a rock for good luck. We got in
the car and turned up Uli Roth! Then Aidan had some good music to play.
At Ross Lake, we arrived just as the party from Beaver Pass was emerging
from their adventure. They gave Theron's car a jump, as the battery was 
inexplicably dead. We ate a burger with them in Marblemount, then sped
away for Mexican Food in Sedro Wooley.

Two days later we had a massive meat grill feast at Theron's house as the
trip of a lifetime became memories.
