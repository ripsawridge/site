Tonight I went to a meeting of the Munich Wanderers, an english-speaking
group of hikers in the area. Seemed like most everyone was German though,
and there to practice english? That was fine, it was an interesting group
of people. I ordered the evening menu to eat and regretted it. It was two
plump watery sausages that the knife could barely cut through, and then
the insides came swimming out. I was appalled! I managed to eat most of
the internals of one of them, but then I got completely grossed out. No
offense to sausage lovers, normally I'm a big one. But I just never saw
this kind of...thing...before.

Anyway, a neat lesson from an older guy named Erik, from Swabia. He said
teaching children is setting an example for them. So, when his boy was
little, he'd ride in the back seat and tell his dad if he was over the
speed limit. Erik used to speed, and say "bullshit" to all that speed-limit
nonsense. But with the "controller" in the back seat, he said "oh, okay"
and slowed down right away. Erik thinks that this helped the boy learn
good social manners. If he saw his dad breaking rules, then he'd feel entitled
to do the same. He might obey rule X or Y, but would always be opportunistic
in looking for a rule to break. "Children are like apes!" said Erik.
  
  
I also just loved the story Kris told me last night about the little fellas
in their room at night. What a picture she painted! I can just see Rowan
crawling jerkily towards the open door with it's sickle of light, half
asleep, yet excited to be a part of the activity. He is just beaming but
his eyes are puffy and closed against the light. He is so happy! And yet
he falls asleep again, crumpling forward as if the batteries died.
  
  
And Elijah, sitting up in the dark somehow. Right when the door opens
he is looking at you! Did he know you were coming? What was he thinking
in there? What made him sit up? And he's learning the work banana, or at
least working very hard at learning it. Kris said he studied her face intently
each time she said it. Perhaps he was sitting in the dark, saying "na na",
still working hard on it. That's my boy!
  
  
And how she'd lie down next to Rowan, who would be so overjoyed with happiness
to have a visitor that he'd lie there smiling and looking at her and beaming.
Unable to sleep he begins crawling in a circle to burn off happiness, always
coming right back to be next to his mom. Smiling again. The cycle begins
anew!
  
  
I like how Rowan bangs the keys with abandon, and Elijah always plays
b-flat and occasionally the two adjoining black keys: never two notes at
once! He'll look around for acknowledgement of his composition. How does
he know there is an end, when he should look for applause?
  
  
Being away for awhile, these transmitted memories have the glimmer of
trophies, and I don't want to forget them.
