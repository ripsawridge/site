### Wendelstein
_December 31, 2021_

Last day of the year! Barbara and I enjoyed hiking up Wendelstein
from Bayrischzell. Wet, rotten snow higher up. On the summit a
nice man had a little dog, but the dog didn't want "streicheln"
from Barbara, which left her feeling sad. As usual with my girl,
she thought about it and found a positive side. Mara is always
there in her heart and memories, and dogs in general tug at her.

I tried bombing down the ski piste for part of the descent -- what
a mistake! My socks were soaking wet from falling through the snow
into bogs.
