Yesterday Kris, the boys and I got up fairly early and went to the Blomberg
ski/sledding area, about a good hours drive away. It's been snowing a lot,
and we've never really gone sledding since we moved here. Time to remedy
that!

We rented two sleds and paid our fee to be lifted up the mountain. The
lift seemed to take forever and we got cold, especially because it started
snowing, heavier and heavier as we climbed. At the top we got off and took
shelter in a little three-sided shack. One more glove/hat/zipper check,
and we were off. Kris and Elijah on one sled, me and Rowan on the other.
We were a bit apprehensive. What if it's icy and too fast, and we hate
it? We just committed for a three mile trip down! But the first short run
was great fun. We had to walk a while (along the way we saw [this neat piece of outdoor art](http://www.panoramio.com/photo/23061999),
it is only visible when you stand at a certain spot), then it turned into
more or less continuous sledding down the mountain for miles.
  
  
This was super fun! I wish we'd done it last year. We learned to crudely
steer by dropping one leg in the snow. Once Kris and Elijah fell turning
a corner, this was very memorable and fun! Rowan seemed to like bumps a
lot, but 3 times he got a spray of powder in his face that wasn't much
fun.
  
  
An hour after we got there we were down. We would have gone one more time,
but we didn't have enough cash with us (I thought they would take a credit
card...it's obvious I've been in the U.S. for a while!).
  
  
Then today, we borrowed Riki and Arne's sled and walked over to the Monoptorus,
a little hill in the English Garden. Wow, super fun again! It was just
me and the boys this time. Usually the two kids went down together, but
sometimes I could cram onto the sled too. The kids also had fun climbing
a steep and icy hill, pulling on brambles and sometimes falling down the
icy slope.
  
  
Time to get our own sleds, this is going to become a decent chunk of our
winter lives!
