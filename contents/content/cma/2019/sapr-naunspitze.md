### Naunspitze

_April 28, 2019_

I hiked up via the Oberndorfer Weg that Barbara and I used a month ago. There was less snow overall, but
fresh snow above the hut, and pretty much continuous snow with good track from the hut to the summit.
The weather cleared pretty nicely right around 12:30 when I stood on top (took about 2 hours), then
it started snowing again while I ate Spinatknödel in the Vorderkaiserfeldenhütte. I hurried down
awkwardly, very much needing to replace my tennis shoes as the tread was too worn away! About 1150
meters up and down.
