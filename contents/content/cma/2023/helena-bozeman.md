*First, 65 miles from the CDT detour (trail was closed for the summer) to Butte.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/segment5.jpg %}
*Then back to the highway for the walk to Whitehall and across the Tobacco Root
Mountains for 104 miles until a hitch to Ennis for supplies and camp.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/segment6.jpg %}
*Finally a scanty 32 miles from Ennis Lake to Big Sky, where Robert took us to his place in Bozeman.*

191.4 miles, 36,000 feet elevation gain for this section. Two discontinuities:
first, we couldn't start at MacDonald Pass when leaving Helena. Second, we
got tired of road walking so our hitch to Ennis began a few miles before hitting
the main road. The next day we started at the main road to make our way to
Bozeman.

*The text below refers to the same events as the blog entries:*
* [Butte](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2023/07/butte.html)
* [Into the Tobacco Root Mountains](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2023/07/into-tobacco-root-mountains.html)
* [To Big Sky and visit with Robert and Julie](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2023/07/to-big-sky-and-visit-with-robert-and.html)

In Helena I went into Fire Tower Coffee Shop and didn't come out again for
hours, having a great breakfast and coffee, and numerous conversations.
First with Mike and Heather, then an unusual young lady named Rachel who studied
religion. I once met a very interesting man on the internet, a yogi, as
he said. And I think he might live around here and play the violin.

I booked a room at the Budget Inn Express just up the street. AFter this
I walked east to Walmart (I think) to buy the next leg of supplies.
Then I settled in with cigars and beer from the "Man Store" across the
street. Wonderful.

*Inside Fire Tower Coffee, where I had a great breakfast the day of arrival
and long talks with cool peoples.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/2-IMG_20230714_105217_MP.jpg %}
*I met a very interesting guy from New Mexico named Michael
and we spent 2 hours chatting
about life and philosophy at a park bench downtown. So much fun.*

The next day I dedicated myself to sleeping in then stuffing myself again
at Fire Tower. In the afternoon, Cory arrived in town! I was a real idiot...
he could have shared a room with me. But he got himself a room. I bought
beer for the crew (me, Cory, a guy who hiked out with us the next day
and Rachel). I told them to do what I was going to
do: drink the beer and settle in for a nice nap!

I also went to the library at one point to type in a blog entry.
Me and Cory went out to a steak restaurant for dinner, kind of a fancy
place. That was great, too.

# July 15, Day 105

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day105.jpg %}
*21 miles, 4940 feet elevation gain.*

Well, it's time to get going. The three of us split the cost of a shuttle
back to the trail. A bit stretch was closed on the south side of
MacDonald Pass, so we had to make a detour. I didn't complain when our
driver drove us a few miles south passed the Moose Creek Campground
to a road junction, saving us a few miles of walking!

We got out and our third guy took off running, essentially. Cory and I never
saw him again. I don't blame him...we can be weary company. He and I
compared notes on the prior 11 or so days we walked separately.
He'd met Rocketlama, she of the web-comic, as she departed the mountains
at the Benchmark Ranch. He'd also run into Dragonsky and various other
folks we knew.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/3-IMG_20230715_132045_MP.jpg %}
*My only picture of the day, here shown is Cory on the left and a frenchman
who camped with us that evening.*

We got in our 21 miles and came to a saddle just north of Thunderbolt
Mountain with a little camping area. Good enough for the day! We'd had
good weather and pleasant walking. I don't remember any horseflies,
though there were some mosquitoes.

# July 16, Day 106

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day106.jpg %}
*19 miles, 2915 feet elevation gain.*

The day began with a hike mostly up Thunderbolt Mountain though it
mercifully veered off below the summit. Then a long journey off to the
west around another peak. We came up to some rocky ground above the
trees for a few minutes, that was nice. Mostly though, it was reasonably
pleasant forest. Very little bear sign in this country, though occasionally
we ran into someone who said they were around.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/4-20230716_143230.jpg %}
*Cory and I on this warm, fine, long day.*

We continued talking about an idea we got in the Bob: "Strawberry Creek
Radio," a station that might have existed out there, run from a mountaintop
by an odd group of loggers, founded in 1922 and going strong until 1943
when it suddenly went off the air. But on some nights, with a shortwave
radio, you can still pick it up. The rowdy singing of an old loggers tune,
"the Men of Strawberry Creek," followed by a godly address by one
Father O'Conahan. After this, news from the twisted and rainy valleys, and
the remote logging operations west of the Chinese Wall. Notes on
births, deaths, and then the recipe corner, hosted by Mrs Pierce, recently
widowed. Yes, you can still hear it. They're out there, the men of
Strawberry Creek. Perhaps they were always there...

We'd mime various scenes that might have occured. One that always tickled
me was when Father O'Conahan shared visions received in contemplative prayer.
They were always eerily true, but softly pooh-poohed by the radio hosts.
"Oh come now Father, it can't get that bad!" they'd say. He'd said
ridiculous things like "and the sodomites will march under a flag of their
own design," and "small children will be placed on their laps, and they
will be dressed as womenfolk."

Poor Father O'Conahan...probably nipping a bit too much of the Eucharist
wine, hmm, kay?

Anyway, this radio station was the right mix of whimsical, plausible,
inspiring and ridiculous by turns which made it a fun toy for the trail.
I'm still thinking about mocking up some broadcasts...

Also in here we met Maarten, a skinny feller from the Netherlands. He was
resting by his backpack and we walked up to join him in a shade patch.
We'd stick together over the next few days, camping for the night at
Champion Pass, then again near the road, and then we'd hitch into
Butte together. Turns out he is an atheist communist who worships mother
earth (ie, climate change as existential threat...this is how the
atheist sneaks a god back in). Why, he and I filled the woods with the
fire of our very much opposite convictions!

To be entirely truthful, I think the pretty woods were a bit boring, and
he and I were happy to exercise our brains a little bit trying to get
one up on each other. Cory knew it was impossible, so he motored along and
mostly ignored us. Nobody changes their worldview because of the addition
of one more "fact." It does happen...but once it happens in one life, there
are strong antibodies preventing any kind of return. I lost a dear friend
in recent years because he and I gradually crossed the ideological
spectrum as we knew each other. In a span of 7 years, he moved from
conservative to liberal, whereas I went the opposite direction. Now, when
he hears me speak, he can only hear the strained voice of his prior
convictions. He imagines them robotically coming out of my mouth. But
my conservatism is not his. To be fair, I'm probably doing the same thing
to his voice.

Anyway, the country was filling with dirt roads and tracks. We reached
Champion Pass in the early evening and I didn't want to walk another step,
having seen our mileage reach the big 2-0. We set up on the side of the
dirt road and ate dinner, talking of many things.

# July 17, Day 107

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day107.jpg %}
*20 miles, 3190 feet elevation gain.*

Today the pretty-but-boring woods got a bit prettier and less boring.
I was reminded of walks in Markt Schwaben, where I live.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/5-IMG_20230717_114459_MP.jpg %}
*Maarten and Cory on the trail.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/6-20230717_114448.jpg %}
*A panorama from Cory with me and Maarten.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/7-IMG_20230717_133346_~2_exported_440_1689648419642~2.jpg %}
*With apologies for the excessive processing, this scene of Maarten
walking south reminded me of home, which I spent the day missing.*

Home...I missed home! This was the first day of a noticeable melancholic mood
which would strike with increasing frequency over the next month. With the
glories of Glacier National Park over and done with, I had trouble holding
enthusiasm for the trip. Sure, the Wind Rivers were coming up, and I even
found the idea of the Basin mysterious. But "just get it done" is not the
strongest of motivating impulses. It's an impulse, sure. And one I made the
decision to respect. Though, at times, I chafed under the rule of my own
decision.

So, happily Maarten was there to distract me. At one point, we left Cory
behind, vigorously arguing and hiking at the same time. It was quite fun.
By the time it was evening we were all joking about strange men in
cars creeping around these woods to assault us, because we read some comments
about that happening. Of course, that is a serious thing...but we were
a bit crazy and ready for town. We hit our 20 miles, and camped at the
last possibility, leaving a short 4 mile walk to town in the morning.
It was a nice campsite and a fun evening.

# July 18, Day 108

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day108.jpg %}
*4.2 miles, 85 feet elevation gain.*

The day began beautifully...with trail magic!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/8-IMG_20230718_072105_MP.jpg %}
*Cory expresses surprise at a cooler along the trail...what could be inside?*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/9-20230718_072715.jpg %}
*Beer and soft drinks, that's what! Here I drink a "Hamm's" beer for breakfast.
Ahh!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/10-20230718_083120.jpg %}
*Michael and Maarten walk to the highway*.

We stood only for a moment at the road intersection by the freeway overpass
and a car pulled up. A nice lady asked if we needed a ride to Butte.
Did we! Wow, that was the fastest ride I've ever gotten. She and her husband
had worked for many years in the mining industry. She often checked for
hikers at this time of year, and that was why she got off the freeway to
roll by. Amazing.

This meant we'd have a full day for chores in Butte, and we'd get a good rest.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/11-IMG_20230718_090346_MP.jpg %}
*Our lovely and wonderful driver.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/12-IMG_20230718_193138_436.jpg %}
*Me at the Berkeley Pit, looking hardscrabble.*

However, we chose the wrong hotel, the Ramada Inn. We weren't allowed to
check in until 4 pm, and no early check-in allowed! Drat, we'd already paid
for it on the internet...

So Maarten and I went out on the town for a bit after taking care of resupply.
Cory and I only needed 2 days of food, because we'd be in Whitehall after
that time on the Big Sky Cutoff. Though Cory bought some new shoes, too.

Me and Maarten went to see the new Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, which I
found reasonably good. I also loved the popcorn, covered in chemical butter
flavor.

After this, we took an Uber to the Berkeley Pit, which was interesting.
By my lights, we created the pit in order to build our technological
society. And now it has to be drained and monitored forever. Is it worth it?
Yes, I think so. Sorry I don't have some edgy opinion about it.

Back at the room we got a pizza and various other delicacies, and slept well
after a shower. Good times!

# July 19, Day 109

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day109.jpg %}
*19.5 miles, 2800 feet elevation gain.*

I guess we were walking by 9 am. This time our Uber driver was the husband
of the Uber driver from yesterday. He said he met Harrison Ford once, when
he was a butcher at Safeway behind the meat counter. Ford was really nice
and came behind the counter to take a picture with the man. Neat!

We headed up into the woods. Sure enough, Maarten and I got to talking as
we do. But we couldn't expend the whole day arguing with each other. He
was bound for the monument to "Our Lady" who looks over the town (this
is an interesting and beautiful thing), where he'd sleep before continuing
along the official CDT around Butte and off to the west. By noon we'd
said our goodbyes.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/13-20230719_121951.jpg %}
*Here we're staging our world-historic arguments while Cory looks
apprehensive.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/14-20230719_122005.jpg %}
*Nonetheless, we part as friends!*

As Maarten climbed up to a crest, we wended our way up and down through
a forest. As Robert, my friend in Bozeman had told me, we'd see more
granite outcroppings in the landscape. This was true, and we sometimes
rested on a granite knob or boulder. We saw Delmoe Lake below us and I
navigated a complex shortcut (to a shortcut) that saved a bit of up
and down.

As evening came, we faced that old problem of coming out of mountains and
down to civilization -- where is the last free place to sleep with water?
I think we made a pretty good choice at about 20 miles...a flat spot
beside the road and creek, and from which we were able to encourage the
cows to move on. They seemed to find people stressful, and left.
One or two vehicles came by at dusk, but it was quiet beyond that.

# July 20, Day 110

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day110.jpg %}
*14.3 miles, 580 feet elevation gain.*

The day began with some bouldering once we were ready to leave camp.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/15-IMG_20230720_074136_MP.jpg %}
*The Camp Boulder, on which we put three increasingly difficult lines.*

Cory and I were missing the old climbing world, so we got to work
on this thing. There were some tough moves, but we made it up
three times. This was a nice break because face it, it can get monotonous
walking across a whole state, or several of 'em!

We got down to the interstate, good ol' I-90. After a rest underneath, we
set out in the sun for the long walk east to Whitehall. I deployed my
umbrella, which paid for itself just on the service provided this day.
Because it was hot out here.

We got to town and went shopping. I bought a bunch of watermelon slices
which we enjoyed at a shady park bench. We walked to our hotel
and set up to enjoy the evening.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/16-IMG_20230720_192408_MP.jpg %}
*Cory taught me to sew. Here I'm repairing a hole in my pants pocket.*

A huge hailstorm came along, soaking the clothing Cory put out to dry.
I smoked a cigar outside, but somehow made myself sick. Ugh...it was
no fun at all. But within an hour I was better. We watched some tv show
and fell asleep.

The next day, we'd face the Tobacco Root Mountains.

# July 21, Day 111

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day111.jpg %}
*21.2 miles, 4170 feet elevation gain.*

Cory and I set out. It reminded me a bit of the kind of training walks I
did in Germany...many flat miles walking on pavement. Whitehall is on a
plain, and the mountains are fairly distant. Plus, the pattern of land
ownership meant a series of right angle in the road and hours of walking
first east, then west, when we just wanted to go south.

A couple of cute dogs followed us for a good long while. Finally, their
owner drove up and loaded them into a truck to stop their adventuring with
us. Later, a guy drove by in a truck and said we could get some water from
the hose in front of the next house (his place). That was really nice.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/19-20230721_122104.jpg %}
Beating the heat with intelligence!

Finally though, we got onto a dirt road and climbed a hill, stopping for a
while under a shade tree. After this, we really entered the mountains,
walking along a brushy canyon creek with open grass slopes all around.
Then the mountain walls narrowed and we were in timber, following a
faint trail up to a minor pass. We descended into Perry Canyon, then
turned into a narrow valley with Five Trough Spring. Here we climbed
extensively and I remember a nice rest at the top of the pass.

On the way down, the trail traversed a long ways south, but our map indicated
we should just go steeply straight down. However there wasn't really a
trail there, although there was evidence that mountain bikers had been on this
steep slope. The trail kept arcing away to the southeast, and we started to
think we were on some variation that might take us to the first of
several passes we'd planned for the next day. But, alas, finally it
turned decisively down into the valley (none of this was marked on any map).

We reached the bottom of Mill Canyon at a kind of wide spot or campground.
Set up the tents, enjoyed our dinner and settled in for sleep.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/20-DSC05565.jpg %}
Cory doesn't mind the great burning orb in the sky.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/21-IMG_20230721_145316_MP.jpg %}
Cory leads the way to the pass.

# July 22, Day 112

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day112.jpg %}
*18.1 miles, 6000 feet elevation gain.*

The day began with a climb of about 1600 feet to an unnamed pass near
Rock Creek Lake. So far, we'd seen no one in these mountains. We popped
out of deep forest into a subalpine mix of meadow, stream and small trees.
The view of mountains to the south became impressive. We weren't bound
for that country, exactly. We turned east and down along Rock Creek
to reach the trunk valley of the Boulder River. Along in here we were
surprised by a dirt-biker. He was surprised too, he said he never saw any
hikers in here.

Later, Robert would tell us these mountains are a "Redneck Paradise,"
because most of the recreation ("wreck-reation") that takes place is motorized.
That seemed to be true! Anyway, nice fella though.

It was hot and I was tired as we finished the descent to the Boulder River.
Now we walked up valley for miles to reach the settlement of Mammoth. It's
an interesting little town, supposedly a corporation. Okay. I guess some
of the people here are active miners. I was hopeful for some picnic table
with ice-cold lemonade or something, but there was nothing like that.
We could see high peaks ahead of us, but wow, they were a long ways up valley.
So in the hottest part of the day we steamed up the road, which finally
narrowed and disappeared.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/22-IMG_20230722_114322_MP.jpg %}
*Cory in Mammoth, Montana.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/23-IMG_20230722_135808_MP.jpg %}
*Resting in the forest south of Mammoth. Shade was worth something on this
hot day.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/24-DSC05574.jpg %}
*Cory heads to the unnamed pass of the day.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/25-20230722_165347.jpg %}
*Michael approaches the pass, Mammoth off behind him in the valley.*

Behind a cabin we found a steep dirt track that led to high country.
On our left, on the slopes of Horse Mountain we saw industrial mining debries.
Even, in an alpine meadow, a bulldozer and broken down mobile home.
From our camp this morning at 6000 feet, we'd climbed to 8000, descended
again, and now would hit 9500. So at the top of the pass we were glad to
have cracked the spine of the Tobacco Roots, but eager to get down the
other side and find a place to lie down.

The country was scenic for a good ways, but then there was an annoying
road with big "ankle-breaker" rocks in it. We rested right before an
especially steep set of switchbacks, drinking water from a stream as we
sat in the shade. A hiker was walking up from below, but we gracefully
missed each other when he took steep switchbacks on the road, and we
walked straight down a faint path in grass on the other side of the stream.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/26-DSC05583.jpg %}
*Hallelujah!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/27-DSC05585.jpg %}
*Our country to the south. We'll bend off to the east and leave these
mountains.*

There was a campground down-valley and we made for that. We were in South
Willow Creek. We arrived at the campground and found an empty place among
some trucks and campers. It was a good place. Though, at 2 in the morning
someone drove up and appeared to be confused by our tents without any
cars nearby. Finally they settled down and the headlights crazily playing
off our tent walls stopped. Why does that always seem to happen at campgrounds?
Who are these folks who apparently drive all night then arrive in the
early hours of the morning somewhere confused? Oh well, can't complain
at the price of free.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/28-DSC05588.jpg %}
*Campground for the night.*

# July 23, Day 113

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day113.jpg %}
*16.4 miles, 1300 feet elevation gain.*

We walked downvally to about 6400 feet elevation, then crossed the river
and powered up to a low arm of the south ridge for about 1000 feet
of climbing. Here, we had advice that we could ignore the long sweeping
forest service road and follow "cow paths" over the arm for a direct
descent to the Sureshot Lakes on the other side. This mostly worked,
though we had to climb over, under and through several big blowdowns.
But we finally came out. Below, I saw someone kayaking on the lake.
"Look, hippees!" I said, happy to have discovered some non-motorized
wreck-reation.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/29-IMG_20230723_092621_MP.jpg %}
*Cory walks on the arm above Sureshot Lake.*

From this point it would be a long roadwalk to the trunk road of
the great plain between ranges. We settled in for it with music, podcasts,
etc. We chatted with a couple going to kayak at the lakes. Further down-valley
there were some interesting cliffs on the north side that looked perfect
for rock climbing. There was also a proud American flag drapped across
a cliff. Interesting! I love to see people NOT consumed by guilt and
self-hatred for breathing. I think the cities these days just exude that
atmosphere.

We came out of the mountains and walked south along North Meadow Creek.
Here, a few miles from the highway, the car with the kayaking couple came
along. I impulsively stuck out my thumb. It was just too hot. And we
needed a hitch to Ennis anyway for food. Technically, we should have walked
all the way to the highway, but how about preserving a little space for
enjoyment? We were lying on the side of the road in a patch of shade
when they arrived.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/30-DSC05590.jpg %}
*Much road country in mountains.*

Thanks to the existing relationship, they happily packed us in the car
and drove us to the supermarket in Ennis. Nice!

Once there, we met several hikers hiding in the shade of the Dollar Store.
We talked about hitching and the different routes to take in this short-cut
section before rejoining the CDT. Cory and I would get to Big Sky along the
north side of Ennis Lake and the Spanish Peaks. But others would take a more
direct southerly route. Also, we wanted to reach Mammoth, Wyoming with
a more northerly route that let us explore Yellowstone more, while others
would walk a highway directly south to meet the red-line at West Yellowstone.
We were, contrarily, happy to avoid that area because of the recent
death that closed the CDT in that area. A woman was jogging and surprised
a mother grizzly. Later in the summer, that grizzly would be killed because
it was involved in several incidents.

If you wonder how officials know if a particular bear did this or that, my
conversation with the trail angel back at Flesher Pass was enlightening. He often
traveled with biologists in the backcountry and they were constantly gathering
hair fibres from fences and trees. They used these hairs (actually the DNA
from the hair) to identify and track the movement of individual bears.
They became relaxed around bears that they "knew" from their constant data
missions, but were highly cautious if they didn't know the bear. So, it's
possible to get a pretty detailed picture of the movement of a bear, even
though the bear covers huge distances. Essentially, teams of people are
interested and crunching data all the time!

We got our food then looked for a place to stay. Should we hitch back
north to the Ennis Lake Trailhead where we'd keep hiking, or was there a
motel or campground? Cory struck up a conversation with some locals who
offered to drive us to the campground just north, and that made it easy.
"Let's go!" We hopped in a crowded truck with a dog and were let out after
a few minutes. We were given a place to set our tents, and we dedicated
the afternoon to laundry, shower, powering devices, eating and drinking.

There was a huge thunderstorm in the early evening. But it passed on and
we could sit at our picnic table again. Beautiful and dramatic clouds
at the start of that storm...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/31-DSC05592.jpg %}
*Campsite relaxation, adding up the miles...*

# July 24, Day 114

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day114.jpg %}
*14.3 miles, 4750 feet elevation gain.*

Cory and I slept an extra hour after the wine and beer the night before.
Ah! Still, we were up and out there early, looking to hitch a ride north
to the Ennis Lake Trailhead. After only a few minutes a guy came along in
a big truck. He was from Missouri, so he and Cory had a lot in common.
But he was very happy to live out here -- said he'd never go back!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/32-DSC05597.jpg %}
*Cory walks to the lake.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/33-DSC05600.jpg %}
*A similar shot*.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/34-DSC05604.jpg %}
*Ducks on the lake.*

He dropped us off and we walked a road along the north side of the lake
for several miles with pretty views of the mountains. We came to a bridge,
then walked north a half mile or so. An interesting fella came along in
a 1940s vehicle. He was also dressed in clothing from the time. Very
interesting!

We started hiking steeply up a trail that brought us to a high, scrubby
plateau. It was getting pretty hot and we were glad to get back into the
forests, this time, of the Spanish Peaks.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/35-IMG_20230724_091905_MP.jpg %}
*A very interesting vehicle and driver.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/36-DSC05608.jpg %}
*Looking down on Ennis Lake from the plateau. The Tobacco Root Mountains
are behind.*

Our map at this point broke up into different variants people had taken.
We stayed on the main line, though there were two sections described as
cross country travel through light forest. We managed to complete both
of these, though the second cross country section was quite long.

It eventually brought us to an abandoned hunting camp. Perhaps this was
a big deal at some other time of the year. There were all these high
poles, rustic tables and such. But weeds and tall grass grew up between
everything so it also seemed long forgotten.

After this interesting side-show (we sat at the tables for a rest), we
climbed again into higher country. Clouds were building and we started
getting sprinkling rain. We could see snow in the trees beyond. This
made sense because we were walking under the northern slopes of crags.
Though it is July 24!

The last miles were pretty hard. I was very tired of the up and down.
Even though we only did 14 miles, I was beat when we reached an area with
a few flat places to camp right before a steep descent into a valley.
Not wanting to set up the tent in pouring rain, I lobbied for a stop here.

We had a few minutes to eat, but the mosquitoes were pretty bad and soon
forced us into tents. Overall it was a good day but the last part was
tough.

# July 25, Day 115

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day115.jpg %}
*13.7 miles, 4850 feet elevation gain.*

This turned out to be one of the most beautiful days. A lot of work too,
and some risk. But I'll get to that.

We dropped down into a tight valley with two rivers, Alder Creek and the
North Fork of Spanish Creek, both of which we crossed on good trail. From
here we started climbing. There was a section with many long switchbacks
where something changed in me. I was feeling really beat down by the trail,
lately. Lots of road walking and too much forest with no views.

We were coming up to a section I'd studied long before. Supposedly there
was a way to drop down into this beautiful place called Beehive Basin
from a high, alpine pass. But on the map drawn by other hikers doing this
alternate route it said "not recommended."

I ended up looking around online for information on this unnamed high
pass. It seemed that climbers did know it and use it to climb a peak
on the north side. I wrote to a climber on [summitpost.org](https://www.summmitpost.org)
who had knowledge of the area, but never got a reply. This didn't bother
me too much. I thought that if there isn't too much snow, it must be possible.
Robert also offered some positive words about it.

*Heading up to the notch in the ridge.*

However, feeling weak and beaten down as I did, I thought it might be better
for us to just go around this obstacle, dropping down into a valley then
reclimbing on the other side. We'd also miss the beautiful Beehive Basin
if we did that, but it would certainly work and not bring any stress.

Cory was ready for either, certainly. He's not one to complain but I think
the road-walking in this section wasn't his favorite thing either. Also,
I'd at first been keen on a great big trip into the Absaroka Wilderness
in central Yellowstone, but had moderated my stance there over the last
weeks, preferring instead to head as close to south as possible after
reaching Mammoth. As often happens, the thirst for adventure abates somewhat
as the terrain gets closer. Frankly, it's enough work just making it through
each day out here, and energy is limited.

So, with these rather depressing concerns floating in the air around us,
I felt a sudden fresh wind. I thought: let's make a stand here. We'll complete
our alpine cross country adventure in these mountains. What did we come
out here for, anyway?

Spirits lifting, I hiked faster up the hill. I hadn't really exposed all of
these thoughts to Cory. But it was a good time to introduce a new idea,
because the sun was out and we entered a beautiful north-side basin
with burbling streams, boulders and small timberline trees.
We were above Little Brother and Little Sister Lakes. We continued into
the next basin, passing Second Lower Falls Creek Lake, then the
Jerome Rock Lakes, finally Upper Falls Creek Lake.

*Gradually getting up there...here we're at some lake outlet.*

After this point we had to make a decision: would we go for our alpine
journey or take the trail down into the South Fork of Spanish Creek?
One big worry I had was how much time all the cross country travel would
take. But I was happy to see on one map that we should have trail as far
as the lower Spanish Lake. Awesome!

Cory said okay, and we started traversing another pretty basin.
Finally though, at Lake Solitude we had to climb an **extremely** steep
trail up to a pass on the main ridge. Boah, I had to go so slowly on this.

Cory had a problem: he couldn't find his wallet. He'd decided that if we
got cell service he'd try making a phone call about it. So, happily, at
this scenic crest he was able to do that. He got a message that his wallet
had been found! He'd dropped it when we rested at the bridge at Ennis
Lake the day before. So that was some awesome news that somehow
resonated with the decision to do something bigger.

We traversed around a corner from the broad notch on the ridge and met
with a stunning sight: the gorgeous alpine basin of the Spanish Lakes
below us, with high crags above them. Our idea was to go through those,
somehow. We only saw granite walls. Gulp.

*Again, perhaps climbing unnecessarily.*

As Cory joked later, I took off practically running. I was keen to discover
if anything might stand in our way. In the worst case, we could still descend
the river north of the lakes and meet the sad forest trail. I very much
didn't want to do that. Somehow this made me hurry, at least for a while, haha...

We dropped back into big timber on the other side of an impressive buttress
skirted right at it's base on heather and snow-patches. Then started climbing
again to the lowest lake.

What a beautiful sight. There was a camp here with an American flag, and
the smell of a cook fire. We didn't see anyone though. We traversed the
north side of the lake on brushy trail. After a rest we pieced together
bits of trail and cross-country travel to reach the northern shore of
the biggest lake. I was happy for every bit of trail here.

Then we followed a stream up from this lake, thankfully there was a boot path
ground into this steep heather and scree. We came into a hanging valley
with easy travel. Gradually we saw what we needed to do. From a distance
we'd mis-interpreted the correct gully to take. From the broad valley
we traced our line, up the lowest angle scree, boulders and snowfields to
get in position on the scree slopes below our pass.

Soon we were busy with this work, quite enjoying ourselves chosing the right
line. This is such a fun activity...quite different from the "grind-it-out"
of much long distance hiking. Finally we reached the point where we had
to go straight up.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/51-IMG_20230725_153151_MP.jpg %}

{% image /cmaimages/2023/54-DSC05658.jpg %}
*Cory at the little pass.*

We set to it, side by side in case the shifting talus were to let go at one
point. They were biggish, dark granite blocks, which made deep grinding
noises settling under our weight. As we climbed, walls closed in and
we had trickier ground above...steep dirt alternating with little rock
scrambles. The ground broke up into steep and shallow gullies and we had
to pick a line.

At this point I went to have a quick look to the left right into the central
slot, which didn't seem appealing below. To my happy surprise, it had become
a kind of highway to the notch, at least compared with the steepening terrain
we were on now. Cory came over and we made our way up this slot, again,
side-by-side when possible.

And suddenly...we had done it! We sat at the tiny notch and were quite pleased.

Only one thing to do: get down. I thought this side should be easier. For
one thing, it faced south-east whereas the way up faced northwest.

Hmm. We had no snow on the way up, but we could already see chunks of snow
down below us on the south side. Okay...

We resolved to go slowly and carefully, staying near each other so that any
falling rocks wouldn't have a chance to bean the one below. There were scruffy
hints of trail, always leading out and around a buttress, because the central
slot continually became a nightmarish wither of dirt and smooth rock.
The buttresses were nice because they offered solid, incut edges for hands
and feet, but worryingly, required an increasing number of "climbing" moves
as we descended.

"Surely this is the hardest part!" I kept thinking. In fact, the hardest
climbing moves were in about the middle. In the lower half, we faced increasing
contact with rock hard snow, and had to venture from one side of the gully
to the other. This part was the most tiring.

I was glad Cory had climbing experience...it's an absolute must. At one point
I thought he was about to be unbalanced by his pack and I said rather sharply
to hold on. Clearly, we were on serious terrain. In tennis shoes. With
multiday packs.

Hmm. Okay.

Finally though, we were almost down. The release of tension was great. Lots
of whooping and doing a play-by-play of the different moves. Whew!

The last several hundred feet down to camp were triumphant. Wow...we did
it. We did something hard, uncertain. It felt good.

*Same, with the tent of the three young men visible.*

*My tent in Beehive Basin.*

And strangely...it had an effect that lasted the rest of the trail for me.
That is, I felt content. Like...we're on an adventure. And not just a
"grind-it-out" adventure, but one which required some careful thought and
exposure to risk. I know the bears are a risk. But for me...not really the
right kind.

Is it possible to have a "risk preference?" I guess I have one. Cory, who
continually grew stronger as we hiked, outstripping my abilities by a mile,
nonetheless asserted that on days like this when I see a peak to climb,
I'm pretty strong. He's right, and it's just evidence that my character
still needs a lot of work: I'd rather be motivated primarily by duty,
than by some entirely personal enthusiasm. But so it is, at this time,
in this world!

We set up our camp with a view back to our difficult descent. I made a drawing
of it as we sat by our tents and ate. Three young guys were camping at a
little tarn a little ways away. I slept happily here.

# July 26, Day 116

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day116.jpg %}
*9.5 miles, 450 feet elevation gain.*

We only had to get down to town. I was able to contact Robert the day
before at the high notch, and he'd come get us at lunchtime. We had to
descend several thousand feet over 10 miles, no big deal...

I was glad to have several maps though, because we needed to take a
rather strange steep trail not marked on the map into the North Fork
West Fork of the Gallatin River (that name is correct!). Finding this
trail took some effort. We'd come down the beautiful basin to some roads
where mansions were being constructed for American royalty.

We got down to the river and the miles passed easily. Finally a dirt
road led down to hot open country and the highway.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/62-20230726_065737.jpg %}
*Goodbye Beehive Basin.*

We walked this rather unpleasant road (bad shoulder) for more than an
hour, then stumbled into town. There was a coffee shop where we set to
eating everything they had. We met the three young men here from camp
the night before, and chatted with some other people too.

Then Robert arrived! He whisked us away to Bozeman for a fantastic visit
with Julie as well as Mark, Roberts good friend who had also moved out here
and become, along with Robert, an expert climber of the region.

Robert really saved us from an enormous expense, too. The only hotels in
Big Sky cost over $200 per night. That would have been no fun! Plus
we learned so much about the region in this visit. I'll have more about it
in the next report.
