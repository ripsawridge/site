Paul and I stayed in Canazei, and did a little hiking. I also went alone
and hiked up to near the summit of Col Rodela from town, actually to the
Rifugio des Alpes restaurant a bit below the summit. It was getting dark
and I needed to get back down. About 1000 meters up and down. Beautiful
ridge hiking on the way up.
