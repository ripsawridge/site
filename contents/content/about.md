## About me

<img align="left" width="200" src="/images/portrait2.jpg" alt="On the Swiss Via Alpina"/>

This site is primarily devoted to my longtime hobby of alpine climbing.  I
learned to climb in Washington State, and moved to Munich in 2006 to explore
the Alps.  I enjoy the mountain activities so much that Iâ€™ve obsessively
recorded them since the very first climb in 1997.
