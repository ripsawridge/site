*I'm still working on this trip report, but I've got the elevation
data and the gps points up...*

200 kilometers and 14288 meters elevation gain.

It's time to return to the Via Alpina Red, that long trail that
crosses the European Alps from Trieste to Nice. I did a section in
2018 over a couple of weeks and wanted to pick up where I left off.
But I left off in a strange place and decided to pick it up a bit
later, knowing I'd have to come back for the missing section.
Starting from Maloja, near St. Moritz seemed like a good option because
I could reach it in a few hours of train travel. Once I was established
in Maloja, I saw it would be a good place to go the *other* way
(back east) to pick up the missing section later. So it is.

*101 kilometers and 7028 meters elevation gain*

## Day 1, 33 kilometers, 1600 meters elevation gain to Innerferrera

After a dinner in Maloja and a good night's sleep, I was hiking up and
away west around 7 am. It was nice to be back on a long trail with
a light pack. I had a jacket, gloves and hat. I had some cash, my Kindle
E-Reader, my phone for a camera, sunglasses and a kind of funny tripod
I'd use to take some pictures and video. Maloja is pretty high, around
1800 meters. The country was beautiful, with only a scrim of evergreen
trees around the lakes, the mountains rising bare above them with a
mix of green meadow and light brown granite. All surrounded by
morning clouds rapidly burning away in the broad valley.

*The Lej da Segi from above Maloja*

With the *Lej da Segi* shimmering below, I started climbing to the
*Piz Lunghin* and its little lake which marks the start of the *Inn* River.
I said goodbye to that eastern country and turned west to cross
the *Pass Lunghin* into the broad *Sett* Valley and its famous pass,
manned by monks in the middle ages to protect and save travelers
making their way south to commerce in Italy. Here I had great views
looking south to the *Pizzo Badile*, a mountain I want to climb one day
by the classic granitic north ridge. I'd spend the trip mostly in
Switzerland but dropping into Italy for a day or two or even an hour
or two. I definitely noticed the prices were better on the Italian
side! In fact, I'd recommend sleeping in Italy when possible...

*The view from Piz Lunghin*

Climbing up from the *Pass da Sett*, I entered clouds again then crossed
the spine of mountains at *Forcellina* around 2600 meters. I had a long
chat with a nice Swiss couple here, we laughed about some *Steinböcke*
looking down on us from the cloud-bedecked peak *Columban*. Then I
turned north and traversed a high bench above the *Juf* Valley, looking
down on the mysterious town of *Juf*, which is the highest continuously
inhabited village in Europe. At the little town (just a collection of
houses), I joined the *Walserweg* which traces a path of settlement
of the Walser people. These people began migrating out from the Wallis
valley (where the Matterhorn is) in the 10th century and continued
into other Swiss/Italian/Austrian valleys for the next few hundred years.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/6_IMG_1177.jpg %}
*On my way to Juf*

In this benighted time they had unusual freedom. They owned their land,
they were not serfs. Whereever they settled, they established
hereditary rights over the land. Sounds easy, yes? But think how hard it
must have been to make a living in these incredibly high valleys in a
time when it was colder than today. But it must not have been too bad.
Overpopulation is cited as a possible reason for their migration...

*A charming village on my descent*

Walking down the road from Juf, I stopped at a little shop in Cresta for some
chocolate milk and snacks. I still had a long ways to go -- I was
trying to hike two usual days in one day. After a scenic walk over a
bridge with cliffs and cascades beneath I reached the lower valley
at around 1700 meters, mostly forested now. I listened to an exciting
podcast called [The Exorcist Files](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2-case-08-predatory/id1635371540?i=1000663920768),
in particular an episode called "Predatory." Fantastic, interesting stuff.

With sore feet, I stumbled into Innerferrera and spent the night at a
fantastic little hotel. I ate dinner at the attached restaurant, sitting
outside and enjoying the sunset with a beer. I had a fantastic conversation
with a Swiss journalist who was walking the *Walserweg*. We talked about
photography and philosophy.

## Day 2 - 20 kilometers, 900 meters elevation gain to Isola

After breakfast, I crossed the river and climbed a forest track into the
*Val di Niemet*. I sat for a while in the high valley in the sun and
read some C. S. Lewis. Crossing the Passo di Emet, I entered Italy and
started running into many people. There were so many more out and about
in Italy! Where I'd seen groups of 2 once per hour before, now I saw
groups of 5 or 8 every few minutes. I descended to the Montespluga lake
and descended a lovely gorge along a trail called the *Via Spluga*.
I was a bit worried about overnight accomodation. A web site said there
were no rooms in Isola, which was worrisome because if I couldn't stay
there I'd probably have to take a taxi somewhere rather far. So I just
walked into the hotel and asked. Sure enough, there was a room - yes!

I took a nap, enjoyed dinner outside again, then fell to my rest.

## Day 3 - 20 kilometers, 1132 meters elevation gain to Mesocco

Now I was in a section of country marked by north-south trending
mountain ridges with deep, v-shaped valleys as I traveled west over the
next days, and each valley getting deeper even as the mountain passes
remained at a similar elevation. I passed a collection of houses
called *Borghetto* perched on a high east-trending arm coming down
from the ridges. Here I saw an old woman and two little kids. They were
the only people I'd meet all day. In beautiful weather I passed the
*Lago Grande*, and continued to the *Passo della Serraglia* (around
2280 meters). After crossing a long meadow where the trail disappeared
I entered a dramatic granitic gorge with dramatic falls and cliffs
marked by chains to hold on to in steep sections. The valley far
below was marked by an intricate highway where cars zoomed along in
rounded switchbacks crossing from a tunnel on one side of the valley
to the other in great, arcing curves. Pretty impressive! But the
trail through rugged forest was very, very steep.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/30_IMG_1313.jpg %}
*The country becomes friendlier*

I walked in afternoon heat and haze through a town called Ghifa, then
continued under the highway through a forest to reach
Mesocco. I stopped for a beer at a little pension, and the owner was a
very nice lady who said I could possibly sleep there if I didn't mind
sleeping in a basement room on some blankets on the floor. I was
willing, but she may have thought better of it, and recommended I take
the bus to Soazza for the night, so I did.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/31_IMG_1315.jpg %}
*But the valley is still far below*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/32_IMG_1324.jpg %}
*Mesocco in the distance...*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/33_IMG_1328.jpg %}
*Weaving between highway overpasses...*

The other guests at the little hotel in Soazza were highway workers. In
general it seemed that a lot of local people were on vacation and had
kind of closed up shop for part of the summer. My dinner was rather
spartan - bread, cheese and butter in my room, but I went down to
a restaurant for an after-dinner drink. I liked my room quite a bit,
it had a little sitting area and was in a charming building in the heart
of the village.

## Day 4 - 16 kilometers, 1460 meters elevation gain to Rossa

After a good breakfast with the highway workers, I took the bus back
to Mesocco and marched up a steep forest on the side of the highway
to an empty village on the mountainside called *Ceta Sot*. I only had
a few friendly donkeys here to keep me company beside a bubbling
spring and a bench. I thought about the phrase *the Wages of Sin are Death*
and it made a lot of sense to me in this way: when I "sin", I follow
a mistaken impulse, valuing some pleasure other than God. And thusly I
enter Time, because I fear the ending of that pleasure. Entering Time,
I become subject to Death, which is the cessation of that mistaken pleasure.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/37_IMG_1349.jpg %}

*Beautiful morning in Ceta Sot with the donkeys*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/41_IMG_1361.jpg %}
*What a nice place...*

I was amazed to find how *logical* this somewhat mystical statement is.
Error leads to death because it occurs in Time, and all things fail in
Time, especially this poor body!

So...okay...now I was where I wanted to be: contemplating things in a fresh
way. This is the gift of solitude, and what a joy it is to be able to
experience it in this crowded world. Crowded with my desires, which
ever multiply and complexify.

Finally I was above the trees again and crossing the next pass: the
*Bochetta de Trescolmen* (again, around 2200 meters). I descended to an
alp and rested on the porch of an empty house, then descended to another
gorge...still rugged but less dramatic than the gorge of the day before.
Here I met a friendly couple.

*Time for another steep, westward descent!*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/47_IMG_1392.jpg %}
*From the hot valley floor, looking up to my descent*

I continued down into the trees and reached a settlement called Valbella,
seemingly inhabited by vacationers from the hot plains of Italy.
I walked downvalley into Rossa, and stayed at a pension by the river.
The nice elderly couple who ran it made me a dinner of *polenta*, salad
and mountain cheese. After dinner I walked around and watched the sun
go down and the sky turn pink. I was the only guest, aside from a
startling collection of dolls and knick-knacks that crowded the upper
floor. I slept to the sound of the river outside...

## Day 5 - 16 kilometers, 1700 meters elevation gain to the Capanna de Cava

From Rossa, I kept walking the road south in the narrow, v-shaped valley,
then (deviating a bit from the standard ViaAlpina trail) turned up on the
west side to a little hamlet called *Masciodone* where I saw a dog. Above
this, a long romp in a steep forest, finally emerging above the trees
at a little hut with a young woman washing clothes. It was starting to rain.
I waved hello and hurried on, setting up my gear for a rainy walk under
a tree as big drops landed in the dirt around. Sheep were here, too.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/51_IMG_1423.jpg %}
*A house along the road...a healthy people can appreciate their flag*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/52_IMG_1425.jpg %}

{% image /cmaimages/2024/53_IMG_1427.jpg %}
*Masciodone*





I was entering the stony *Val del Gabrines*. The pass seemed so far away
as I climbed the rocky slopes, sometimes using my umbrella when the
rain was strong. I found an overhanging buttress with perfect rocky
chairs for sitting out the rain and had some lunch. Only a few minutes
more of walking brought me to the rocky *Bocchetta di Pianca Geneura*,
a little gap in the mountains. Weather looked a bit better on the west
side...

{% image /cmaimages/2024/54_IMG_1434.jpg %}
*High country approaching the pass*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/55_IMG_1440.jpg %}
{% image /cmaimages/2024/56_IMG_1445.jpg %}
{% image /cmaimages/2024/57_IMG_1466.jpg %}
*Looking back to the damp and stony Bocchetta di Pianca Geneura*

A steep and stony descent brought me to a little alp, then I rounded the
upper valley wall and rested for a while at another alp (*Alpe della Motta*).
A short climb brought me to a dramatic pass where I could descend into
a basin to the north where my overnight accomodation lay, the
Capanna de Cava. The descent was interesting...steep, often traversing,
sometimes climbing down granite blocks. I was often in a cloud but occasionally
it would depart and I'd see the house below in the sun near a lake.

However, as I descended the rain really started coming down again, and by
the time I arrived it was pretty wet out! I put my shoes and other things
in a warm place to dry and hung out in the main room.

The hut was run by a single mother with a son and daughter. The daughter
was learning english and we had a nice conversation. I talked to the
whole family, it was fun. Some other guests were there. In particular a
man hiking the Via Alpina. Somehow he had gotten some coffee from the
young washerwoman at the hut on the other side of the mountains! He
connected me to a "WhatsApp" group of the ViaAlpinists. Apparently there
was an American woman with a huge pack some distance ahead of me. This
fellow also had a larger pack. In general, everyone was prepared to
camp even if they didn't do it very often. I should probably be that way
too...the hut every night becomes quite expensive.

*Looking down to the Capanna de Cava*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/59_IMG_1481.jpg %}
*View from the Capanna*

I also spoke in german with a woman from the valley below. She told stories
of the cats in her family. She was crazy for cats! She also had a son
who died. She was an artist too, very interesting person.

We had a great dinner and I stayed up the longest, enjoying the great room
on my own for a while, then retreated upstairs to my corner of the bunk
room.

## Day 6 - 12 kilometers and 250 meters up (but 2000 meters down!) to Biasca

A short climb brought me to the Forcella di Lago, a beautiful spot with
a lake and rapidly descending valley below it. The valley floor lay
2000 meters below, and would be shimmering in the heat by the early
afternoon. I went down and down, finally rounding the valley wall to
reach mid-elevation settlements, both maintained and abandoned. Farmers
traveled these tiny roads with equally tiny vehicles, seemingly specially
built for such terrain.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/63_IMG_1508.jpg %}
*At the Forcella di Lago*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/64_IMG_1512.jpg %}
*A "pano-rama" from near the lake*

At one point I descended stone steps for 500 vertical meters. What a lot of
work must have gone into creating that staircase! Later, a long forest
walk got me closer to town, and I emerged in heat and sunlight beneath
two women working on scaffolding high above, repairing some kind of fresco
on an old building. I remember liking their easy energy with each other
and soft voices. I went into a church and made some time with God. I'd asked
for some special help on this trip, and I'd definitely received it.

I ate an excellent lunch, a kind of "white pizza" with delicious Bufula
mozzerella. I then went to my hotel to get out of the heat -- it was
oppressive! Later in the evening I went back out to walk
to the supermarket on the south end of town.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/65_IMG_1518.jpg %}
*Biasca, pretty hot down there!*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/66_IMG_1521.jpg %}
*Cool water at a rest stop*

I had a slight problem now. The next days of trail were destroyed by flooding
in June and wouldn't reopen this year. I wasn't taking it that seriously,
but the ViaAlpina hiker and his "WhatsApp" group had made it plain that the
trails were definitely destroyed. There was an extensive re-route, but it
looked uninspiring -- lots of road walking, and avoidance of the high
country I wanted to follow.

{% image /cmaimages/2024/67_IMG_1528.jpg %}
*Biasca from the forest above*

{% image /cmaimages/2024/68_IMG_1532.jpg %}
*The church, a good place!*

I decided to skip ahead and take a train to Realp, then over the Furka Pass
to catch the Via Alpina again where it emerges from the southern, now-wrecked
Italian valleys at Ulrichen. The train would consume a half day, then I'd
be walking down the Rhone River Valley for several days. I'd get a view of
the Aletsch Glacier emerging from the high peaks and see the Valais peaks
on my left side. That sounded more fun!

I had bad luck with glasses at this hotel. I dropped a beer bottle and it
broke. And in my room at night, I broke the water glass in the bathroom
by bumping into it. Ach!
