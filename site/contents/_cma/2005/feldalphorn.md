<h2>A ski tour in the Kitzbuehler Alps</h2>

I was eager to try out my new touring skis. They are a pretty cool setup:
Dynafit boots, bindings and skis. Very lightweight but sturdy enough for lift
skiing too. Josef and Angie invited me on a New Year's Eve tour to the peak
called Feldalphorn. It is an ideal beginner location, and really good for
everybody because it combines good snow on moderate slopes safe from avalanche
danger with easy routefinding and a nice ability to start skiing with a great
view right from the car.


The day started out pretty poorly though. First, while quietly gathering my
things in the morning, I fell down the stairs! Kris heard bouncing noises
punctuated by groans of pain, and a final low moan. I was pretty upset because I
didn't want the boys to wake up. I had slipped partially because of some very
slick socks. It's a spiral staircase, and the width of the stairs becomes
infinitely small on the left. I misjudged the size of the step and then was
unable to stop the fall. So, I skied around with a stiff neck.


The next problem happened once I was on the train. Happily thinking of the day
of skiing ahead, I wasn't too concerned when the train stopped in an industrial
area near Grafing. But soon, because I had two connections to make, I started to
wonder. An hour later, when I'd hopelessly missed my connections, and was
wondering if I should just go home, I came into Rosenheim. From there, I got a
new schedule, and after a phone call with Josef, a new plan was in effect that
would only cost 30 minutes.


Naturally I was pretty upset when this new train ground to a halt in a scrub forest area somewhere along the way. I was sure lightning couldn't strike twice, but as the delay stretched over an hour I wondered miserably "why me, God?" And dang, Josef and Angie would be waiting and waiting, possibly without knowing what had happened! Finally the train started moving, though the damage in my mind to the prestige and exactitude of Deutsche Bahn was considerable!


Josef and Angie were nonetheless in good cheer despite the extra hour and a half
of hanging around, which I was grateful for. I felt pretty bad for them! And
when Josef said that the tour wasn't ruined or anything, I felt even better.


We drove a few minutes out of Woergl and were soon parked at the trailhead. We
got going pretty quickly, and soon were skinning up the trail. This was really
fun - the sun was out, with mysterious clouds burning away to reveal mountains
across the valley. It felt like spring, and the cool, dry air seemed very
healthy.


We passed a barn, and then occasionally smaller huts and hay storage buildings
in meadows. A trip through a small forest led us to higher open slopes. After a
while, we gained a ridge that curved rightward above a bowl to the
summit. Skinning up on the ridgetop was great, because we had views to the north
and south. A fellow just ahead was having trouble with his skins, so I broke a
new trail to the right. I definitely think it's easier to travel in deep snow on
skis than in snowshoes. You just have to push your foot forward rather than lift
it out of the snow, and stomp a new print. More "elegant."


We reached a summit, and took off our skis to walk a hundred feet to the true
summit. What an excellent scene! Josef pointed out the Grossglockner in the
distance. He and Angie had skied mountains to the south just the day before, and
their lunch for today was still frozen from a cold night. Sadly, they had to eat
icy carrots! But Angie had made some amazing cookies, and I was especially
excited by a gingerbread cookie that had a paper-like substance affixed to the
bottom of each cookie. It tasted great! I was never a fan of gingerbread, but
after this intriguing time with the pseudo-paper, I will seek it out again.


Now it was time to go down. I was a little scared, remembering my last
backcountry ski experience 6 years ago, before I really knew how to ski at
all. Continually perplexed by deep powder, I tested my companion's patience by
constantly collapsing into a pile somewhere behind him! I wasn't sure how my
several weekends of practice on lift-served slopes two years ago would fare in
this nice deep snow.


But there was no more time for uncertainty, Josef and Angie were already gone! I
followed, making tentative turns. Wow, they worked! Even though I couldn't see
my boots at all. We continued, with Josef pointing out the best way down the
next section. Though I was working too hard, with lots of tension in my legs, it
was still really fun. Just the whole idea of climbing thousands of feet in the
skis, and then getting down with them is pretty neat.


The descent was pretty uneventful, it took us about 30 minutes with plenty of
stopping and looking around. Near the bottom I took a pretty big fall and a ski
came off. It was easy to get it back on. Overall, I was happy with the
equipment, though one binding needs an adjustment and a boot has a frayed
lacing.


We got back to the car, and Josef and Angie dropped me off at home, now in
steady rain. Thanks for a great trip!
