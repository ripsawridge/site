### Brauneck
_January 5, 2017_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck today from the Wegscheid Draxlhang lift. Kris
and I taught the boys to ski here, it brought back memories. Today, Jaro
and I followed the ski touring trail, which was excellent...it largely
avoided the piste in favor of quiet trails in forest. Also, they were
trails and not roads, which I really appreciated.
