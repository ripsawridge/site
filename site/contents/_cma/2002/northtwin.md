I had *most* of a day recently and had to take advantage of a
spell of great weather so late in October. I thought about several
options, but finally resolved to tick off the West Ridge of the North
Twin Sister.  This route is well-known for firm, grippy rock, and
provides a wonderful scrambling experience "hard to equal in it's
grade."  I'd always canceled plans to go there because of the long
logging roads that have to be hiked or biked for 3000 feet of
elevation gain just to get there.  I've really got to make my peace
with these logging roads...but I can't *I just can't!*

I took a bike, pushing it most of the way. I was somewhat worried
about this approach, having heard various horror stories about getting
lost. I left the car at 7:15 am and went up the road, taking the 4th
right as instructed. This comes at about 2.5 miles. The overgrown road
had a tank trap at less than half a mile, then continued gently (I
could actually ride this road) to cross a creek and enter a world of
forest industry. I heard dump trucks and heavy machinery behind the
trees. My instructions were to turn left on an abandoned road with a
dead tree across it. Well, I saw a road with a dead tree beside it,
and thought that was good enough. 20 minutes later, having crawled up
and down 2 dozen tank traps, and abandoned the bike in some bushes, I
realized that this road was taking me away from the mountain. I went
back down, where a friendly worker told me that all the roads were
destroyed like that. He said there were other roads I could try
taking, but didn't know exactly which one would reach the west
ridge. Luckily enough, right before having to somehow ride around an
earth moving machine busily moving earth, I found the road with the
tree across it. Also a little cairn. "Only climbers make cairns," I
reasoned.


This road was pretty steep, and after several switchbacks I made it
to the end (ignoring any turn offs, I believe there were two). A
tent was here, but no people. The west ridge was in perfect view.
It took 2.5 hours to get here, including my wrong turn.


An obvious trail goes up the ridge, into pleasant timber, and out to scrub
trees and boulders with a great view of the rest of the route. Trying
to ignore the sounds of industry behind me, I started up. First I dutifully
followed the cairns that marked little dirt paths between rocky steps.
But eventually I learned that this would severely limit the enjoyable
scrambling! "'nuff of that," I remarked to a pale green
sphere hovering nearby. The rough solid rock provided many handholds, and I
sought to maximize the angle with traverses and walls. On or just below
the crest was best. I met another party midway up, they had the tent
down at the start of the trail. It wasn't worthwhile to read the route
description, as even the steepest sections of rock had cracks
to allow progress. My favorite was a few lieback moves to an exposed
step-across, to a mantle supported by a finger crack, then a hand
crack! It was all lichen-encrusted so I dubbed it a first ascent.
"The Green Orb" Grade 0.0032, 5.7. Behind me, the floating enigma
chuckled. 


The ridge leveled out before the summit, and I climbed a few sub-summits
before getting to the real thing. Mt. Baker was so "in my face," so
"extreme." Especially the Black Buttes. I mentally drew lines snaking 
up their buttresses and wondered what it would be like on them. A few
minutes of relaxation, and I was eager to get down. I especially looked
forward to the bike ride! 


Foolishly, I decided to go down the north face. I chose the lowest angle
section, and descended left of a steep neve field. The rock was terrible,
and every move dislodged a battery of charges. Finally I could scree-ski
for short distances. I reached the top of a cliff and found a way down
traversing to the right. More scree below this led me to a snowfield
and a trickling stream with heavenly water. I had done the whole trip
on one quart of Gatorade, mistakenly assuming I would find somewhere to
refill it. But the only streams up till now had oily muck from the
nearby road and industrial machinery. So this was good.


I climbed down another cliff, then began a long traverse back to the
West ridge, sometimes on slippery heather. Once I slipped into a
huckleberry patch. Rather than get up, I immediately fell to eating
the ripe berries that seemed to drop from the limbs. The green orb and
I sought out the best patches, oblivious to observers friend or foe.
Resuming the descent, I quickly found the trail and hiked down
to the trailhead camp. It was 1:45 pm. As you can guess, the bike ride
was fast, and would have been faster if I were a better biker.
I reached the car at 2:30, and drove back to various obligations.
Later, near the town of Acme, I saw a great view of the Sisters Range
that had been hidden in the morning. A small green speck seemed to
hover near the ascent ridge.


In later years I was often asked about my vision that October day
on the West Ridge. Despite publication of a book of verse on the subject
(now out of print), I never really came to grips with the phenomenon,
though I always felt the presence to be a friendly one (witness the
huckleberry incident, which I still recall warmly).
