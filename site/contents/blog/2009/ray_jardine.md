Here is a quote from Ray Jardine that really struck me today:
  
  

>   
> Highway 90 led through a few small towns. Now in the afternoon, the headwinds
> grew stronger, laying the grasses over and of course slowing our progress
> further. I remembered something the last bicyclist we had met had said,
> when she described that first day of wind which had been so strong. She
> said it was "brutal" and that her whole day had been a battle. Ultimately,
> she could not reach her destination, so her husband picked her up in his
> van. That same day we had peddled nearly 90 miles, into the same wind.
> The difference was in attitude. What you focus on becomes your master,
> and it can and will defeat you. The past week we have experienced these
> strong headwinds, but have not battled them, nor tried to change them.
> We are not here to change anything; we are here to experience. And we are
> here to learn what nature has to teach us, and what the journey has to
> teach us. This difference in attitude is like night and day. When I mention
> the wind, I am making an observation, not a judgment. Most people tend
> to judge everything when they go into nature. Judging means comparing it
> to what they think it should be. And when you do that, you give it your
> strength and your power. We punch through this wind because we do not give
> it our strength. For us it is not brutal because we are not in battle.
>

This is from a 2004 bicycle trip he and his wife made across America.
This couple have done so many amazing things I won't bother trying to even
list them here. Probably the best thing he did for me, personally, was
to get me thinking about traveling as light as possible in the mountains,
indeed everywhere. [Here](http://www.rayjardine.com/adventures/2004-Hello-America/index.htm) is
the link to his story about the bike ride.
