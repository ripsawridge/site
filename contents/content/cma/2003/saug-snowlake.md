<h3>Snow Lake, August 2, 2003</h3>

Kris and I hiked to the Snow Lake at Snoqualmie Pass on this fine afternoon.
We had a fun time. A nice lady complimented Kris on her pretty hair. We
said thanks and felt good. There were many interesting small dogs. On the
way out, one particular dog was amazingly cute. He was white and furry, quite small,
and tilted his head at the exact angle that elicits maximum emotion.
With small paws whirring rapidly to keep up, the head properly tilted, and a
worried somewhat strained expression, he captured our hearts.
