### Wildbarren
_December 31, 2022_

I hiked up Wildbarren on a fine day, certainly too warm for the season.
I met an amazing couple on top, Ulrich and Ira. Truly expert climbers...also
scientists that write interesting papers ([here](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1), an index to their papers
on the physics of mountaineering). We hiked down part of the way
together. They got me excited about climbing again for the health, puzzles
and variety it provides. I'm inspired! Check out their interesting [web site](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1).
