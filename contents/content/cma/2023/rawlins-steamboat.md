*102.3 miles, 13,700 feet elevation gain for the section.*

I'd become a rest-taking machine! Wyoming became pretty "restful" once
we reached Dubois. A zero-day there, then another in Pinedale. And now
Rawlins. This made sense for me because I'd given myself until September
22 before I needed to be back in Germany. Cory and I were a great team,
making good time.

However, at this point it was clear that Cory needed to get a move on to make it
through Colorado before the snow starts. And once I reach the Seedhouse
Campground, just 20 miles south of the Colorado border, I'll need to
begin a season of travel to pick up the missing section in New Mexico
as well as the missing section around Winter Park in Colorado. So I
can't walk along with him anymore. Therefore, he decided not to take
a rest in Rawlins, but push on to Steamboat Springs. In fact, he'd probably
just resupply there and move on (that place is very expensive), not
taking a full day rest until Grand Lake or beyond.

In the evening we smoked a pipe and said our goodbyes, for now anyway!
He's threatened to come to Germany, as he's got a friend that he hiked the
Appalachian Trail with over here. Well, he's got another friend in Bavaria,
too.

The hostel we stayed at was run by an interesting lady named Kate.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDS7WQIjrjI) you can see a video
of her with her interesting trailer and pet goat. There was a bunk room,
a kitchen and bathroom. Also, the place was a laundrymat, which we really
needed! (called the WashBoard). The owner is a woman named Christine with a lot
of character. Kate and Christine had a partnership between the
hostel and the laundry. And indeed,
there was a friendly pet goat walking around!

# August 24, Day 145

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day145.jpg %}
*13.3 miles and 550 feet elevation gain.*

Cory and another hiker headed out from the bunk room early in the morning.
He loaded up with a big pack, carrying enough food to reach Steamboat
without stopping at Encampment, reachable via hitch from Battle Pass.

I slept until I could get breakfast at the cafe. Afterwards, I asked
Christine for a ride 13 miles south so I could walk back to town. I
decided to take the road alternate down to the mountains, since the trail
either parallels it or swings way out west then back east in a way that
felt pointless to me. Plus, many were taking the road and we knew it had some
water caches. If I could break up the 35 mile road walk into a nice half
day today, then have my rest day tomorrow, then there would just be
22 more miles to walk the day after. It seemed like a great plan to me.

Christine told me about life in the area. She moved here from Hawaii, young
and pregnant. She eventually married and misses her husband, now passed away.
She said the mindset of the town is "*please God, give us one more boom and
we promise we'll be more responsible about it!*" She thought the world of
Kate, and it was clear that both of them were dreaming of the possibilities
that her coming to town might unfold, for the business and for life.

At a fork in the road, where the redline comes very close, Christine dropped
me off. I set to walking back north, enjoying having the sun at my back.
This is generally more pleasant. Though in general my experience has been
clear: walk south on the CDT. You'll have way fewer snow problems. When
I think about the snowy difficulties of the Southern San Juans, as beautiful
as they were, I'd say it's far better to make that walk when the snow is
gone.

But when snow isn't a factor, walking north is nice. I was listening to
many podcasts about Catholicism, or by catholics. I was reading St. Augustine's
"Confessions," also G. K. Chesterton. Also Peter Kreefts summary of
St. Thomas of Aquinas "Summa Theologica."

The catholic intellectual tradition is a serious draw.
I also liked the "Pints with Aquinas" podcast and
Matt Fradd's stand against pornography. And I devoured every Peter Kreeft
interview I could find, that man is a national treasure.

I was also listening to the audiobook version of Thomas Sowell's incredible
book ["Intellectuals and Society"](https://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Society-Thomas-Sowell-ebook/dp/B0077BONEY/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1701512902&sr=8-1). There are so many quotable
passages.

It was a beautiful walk. It reminded me of training walks back home. This
is really wonderful country. I wouldn't change a thing.

I rested by the train tracks near town, then finished walking in and
repaired to a steakhouse for dinner.

# August 25, Day 146

My Rawlins zero day!

A nice Denny's style breakfast at the cafe west of the WashBoard.
But later in the afternoon I went to the coffee shop of the first day
(called Mukwano's). I had a long talk with the young man behind the counter
and he shared a beautiful artwork he'd won a prize for.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/1-IMG_20230824_092233_MP.jpg %}
*This amazing artist worked at the coffee shop. He won a prize for
his painting of a ram. He explained to me how he took it from initial
vision to completion. Wonderful.*

Another thru-hiker was here, Cory and I had passed her in the desert.
Nice talk with her too, and then a young lady who showed me pictures of a
pretty canyon in Colorado on a hike with her boyfriend. Dang, Rawlins was
just a place of many conversations with many people!

There is a town shuttle, and I took it out to Walmart on the east side of
town. I didn't like the driver very much, but the passengers were nice.

I hung out in the hostel in the evening chatting with two Canadians doing
the trail, named Shamrock and Scraps. They'd also done the Great Divide up there and an interesting
route through the middle of Vancouver Island. A very cool couple.

# August 26, Day 147

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day147.jpg %}
*26.7 miles and 2890 feet elevation gain.*

Christine drove me out to the same place she dropped me off before.
We said our goodbyes, having really enjoyed the conversation, realizing
that we see things the same way in many respects. Thomas Sowell's book offers
an idea of two basic worldviews on life: the "Anointed Ones" and the
"Pessimistic View." The anointed ones believe we are the only ones coming
to rescue us (to use one of their favorite phrases), so we need to remake
the world according to our elite's designs. We come from caves and will go
on to the stars, and we were worse in the caves and we'll be angelic once
we reach the stars. This view creates governments with top-down control
and rule by elite.

The Pessimistic View, on the other hand, expresses the idea that human beings
are both special and flawed *at the same time*. In the "caves" of the past were men and women
equal and beyond us in moral intelligence, as well as brutes. And in the
future it will be the same. What we call "civilization" is fragile, and can
be destroyed easily. We should be humble about our abilities to predict and
control the world. We can and should do some of that, but always with
humility. The humility is expressed in the concept of a free market of ideas
and goods, recognizing that any one of us may go badly wrong in our thought,
but some may come to wisdom. If it *is* wise, then it will be shared and
gradually taken up.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/2-DSC05993.jpg %}
*Gorgeous, long road, looking back north in this picture.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/3-DSC05995.jpg %}
*A friendly road too, a man stopped and gave me some water.*

Christine and I share the Pessimistic View. Note that this view is actually
quite positive over the long run. When the elites see their ideas fail,
they begin to think catastrophically and are full of "doom and gloom."
When the pessimist (in regard to what men are capable of) sees a failing,
he keeps walking, considering the why and how of the failure, and that if
we should try again in this or that, how to do it differently.

The annoited ones seem to be planning mass suicide if Donald Trump wins the
election. The pessimist however, is unphased. Maybe *he* doesn't understand
why that particular man won the election, but somebody else did. He'll continue
operating in his sphere of influence for the good. I've kind of had enough
of the "hothouses" the elite create. They establish idols and worship them.
It's very boring. I'm sympathetic to the idea that a modern problem is an
overproduction of elites...of their opinions, flogged endlessly. Of their
roles and programs, their time-wasting ideas about education.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/4-IMG_20230826_132631_MP.jpg %}
*At the helpful water cache, reading and drinking.*

A man brought a thru-hiker to a trail (I guess they decided to skip both
the "redline" and the road too), stopped and gave me a bottle of water,
then told me that a cache up ahead was fully stocked. Fantastic!

I ran into a few other hikers out here too. Nice conversations.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/5-IMG_20230826_185522_MP.jpg %}
*My camp for the night.*

Finally as the sun went down I was able to turn left off the road and onto
a dirt road leading up into the mountains. I climbed a bit, then came to
a side trail with a beaver pond where I could get some water. Getting
down to the pond was tricky, there were many brambles and steep slopes.
Once there, I walked over the beaver's dam and got some cold water.
The beaver got me back though, because I punched through a trap door and
soaked one of my feet. "Dag nabbit!" I cried, but only the loons heard me
(and a chuckling beaver nearby).

I set up my tent by an abandoned cabin above the beaver pond, and slept
like a grateful baby.

# August 27, Day 148

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day148.jpg %}
*20.6 miles and 4420 feet elevation gain.*

Today offered a mix of trail and roads climbing into the mountains. The
weather was good, not too hot under the trees anyway, and by the time I
was in the open a lot more I was above 10,000 feet and the temperature
was cooler.

It was fun seeing the sere Basin recede into the haze, and peaks of Colorado
appearing. I did see quite a bit of bear scat on the trail and ridge crest
a bit north of Bridger Peak. Enough that it got me shouting out to the bears
again like the old days in Montana.

A bit further on I was in a zone of 4-wheel-drive tracks sidehilling a mountain
in forest below the crest. Pretty thirsty in here. Two couples came by
in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle, bouncing slowly down the trail. The women in the
back offered me an ice cold bottle of water. Thanks!

Up on Bridger Peak there was a radio tower. I skirted the very top (jaded),
and made for a broad meadow looking out south towards Battle Pass and Colorado.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/6-IMG_20230827_160021_MP.jpg %}
*A sheepherders dog kept me company on Bridger Peak.*

A friendly dog came over for some love. I never saw the sheep-herder, but in
the next days, and even in New Mexico later, I'd hear about them. These
guys speak no english and generally come from South America or Eastern Europe.
I saw a nicely painted "gypsy" cart that someone could sleep in for a season.

Later, a day-hiker came by. She said that her family used to own this land,
and she still comes up here now and then. She said she remembered when they
built that gypsy cart, when she was a little girl.

Two thru-hikers, Ghost and his friend (I forgot his trail name, darn it),
arrived and we all sat in the early evening, admiring the view
and petting the dog.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/7-IMG_20230827_190348_MP.jpg %}
*My humble camp at Battle Pass. Restroom nearby!*

Finally I started down. I reached Battle Pass after a few miles and decided
to camp here because there was a flat place in the forest, and a restroom.
Neat!

# August 28, Day 149

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day149.jpg %}
*20 miles and 3040 feet elevation gain.*

I left Battle Pass to the south, first checking for trail magic in a
box beside the trail head. Nothing interesting. Then I entered a series
of parks. Green open space with creeks burbling, surrounded by
trees through which the trail wended. My feet were wet, but it was a
nice reminder that I was back in the mountains.

Clouds gathered as the day warmed. I was in high country of trees and
rocky outcrops, slowly swinging east, south then back west above
the large peaceful-looking Hog Park Reservoir. I hoped to get back down
in the trees before the storm broke. It was more pleasant walking in
forest when those come...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/1-IMG_20230828_120222_MP.jpg %}
*A storm approaches on the crest.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/2-IMG_20230828_123705_MP.jpg %}
*The way into Colorado leads down...temporarily!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/8-IMG_20230828_124818_MP.jpg %}
*Very interesting cliffs coming down from Peak 10466 at the terminus of an
eastward swing of the trail.*

I hiked down past interesting cliffs, then journeyed on narrow trail in
dense young forest on the south sides of several peaks. Eventually I
was on a hogback ridge and came to a sunny dirt parking lot.
I was in the Medicine Bow National Forest. Tonight, just over the
border I'd be sleeping in the Routt National Forest...for the first time
since July 2022.

I rested awhile at a shady place then got ready to walk. But just then,
a couple drove up in a sport utility vehicle. They saw that I was a
thru-hiker and asked if I wanted a beer or a Coke. "A beer!" I answered,
very happy to take the edge off the last miles of the day!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/9-IMG_20230828_144517_MP.jpg %}
*Trail magic at a road junction above Hog Park Reservoir.*

We talked for a while. I was hoping someone else would show up to make their
trip here worth it. But no one did. They were camping down at the Reservoir,
and drove back there with a wave. Cool folks.

I had the choice of a 1000 foot climb up a peak then back to the road I was
on or...just walk the road. Easy choice!

I listened to Thomas Sowells masterpiece of logic, erudition, and dare I say
it, compassion. After an hour and a half it started raining pretty good.
I turned off the road onto trail going east. Big machines were logging in
the trees, and the clear cut was right near the trail.

I saw Ghost in here, he was waiting for his friend who went over the peak,
while he'd taken the road like me.

Under the cover of trees at the edge of the clear cut, I took a break and
organized for heavy rain, with jacket and umbrella at the ready. Then I
walked a few miles as it sprinkled and rained by turn. I was on something
the USGS maps call the "Fireline Trail."

The terrain became kind of scrubby, with many downed trees, young trees
growing up and sharp rocks here and there. Where was I?

The Colorado border, baby!

How long have I dreamed of this place...

For now I didn't hang out, I just wanted to put up the tent while it wasn't
raining hard. I walked about 3 minutes further on, then found a campsite.
I set up, then heard voices back at the border. The rain had stopped.
I went back there and chatted with Ghost and his friend. They took a picture of me
here, and kept hiking, planning to sleep some miles up the trail.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/10-IMG_20230828_175152_MP.jpg %}
*My camp just inside Colorado.*

I came back to my camp, ate dinner and smoked a cigar outside. Very happy to have
completed this milestone.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/11-IMG_20230828_183731_MP.jpg %}
*Two guys got a picture of me at the Colorado border.*

# August 29, Day 150

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day150.jpg %}
*21.6 miles and 2800 feet elevation gain.*

It would be a big day, but the last day in connecting the Canadian border to
where I left off last year. I had no worries about hitching a ride from
the Seedhouse Campground to Steamboat, though I probably should have considered
that the high season was over. But I'll get to that later!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/12-DSC06011.jpg %}
*The trail swings down and up on the crest, heading south.*


The morning was made difficult by a trail that climbed up and down and up
again. It followed a sinewy ridge which twisted off to the west, then back
east again. No switchbacks, just a line taking you up one side of a bump and
down the other. I saw Ghost and his buddy often. A hiker named Lavendar
and I made a rough plan to hitch out to Steamboat together if we arrived at
Seedhouse together. That didn't end up working out, but hopefully they
made it out okay.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/13-DSC06016.jpg %}
*Into the valley I last saw in 2022...*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/14-IMG_20230829_134639_MP.jpg %}
*Ghost and X (forgot his trail name!). We had a long talk here.*

We came gradually down from high country into a gorgeous parkland. Ghost
had a fly fishing rod and set up to catch some fish, while his friend and
I and Lavendar rested in a small patch of shade on the south side of the river.
This must have been at the crossing of Trail Creek above Diamond Park.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/15-DSC06017.jpg %}
*The last miles to the Seedhouse Campground.*

The final journey was hot and somewhat tiring. But I started moving quickly
as I approached the scant buildings and road of the Seedhouse Campground.
Somehow I thought it would be a momentous place. Who would greet me in
triumph?!

Haha, no one. I wandered around on the road and saw no cars, no campers.
Wow. What a difference from the bustling location of mid-July. I started to
fear how I might make it to town. Suddenly a car came up and I stuck out
my thumb rather desperately. "Oh please oh please!" was my thinking...

A kind couple were driving. They heard my story of the long hike and agreed
to give me a ride down the road to the Clark Store. Last year I'd gotten
a hitch from there after buying some snacks. That sounded great. But by the
time we got to talking, they were happy to take me another 20 minutes further
down to Steamboat Springs.

Okay that was incredibly kind. Man...I just was so lucky because of the kindness
of people who went out of their way for me.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/1-IMG_20230829_180244_MP.jpg %}
*Friendly people will help you out, and you'll be amazed every time.*
