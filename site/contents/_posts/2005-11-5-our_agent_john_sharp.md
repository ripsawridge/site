I'd like to thank our real estate agent John Sharp. We've known each other
for a few years through mountain climbing. I remember being amazed to learn
a few years ago that he had climbed the [Northeast Buttress of Johannesburg Mountain](http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/1998/images/johann.jpg) in
the North Cascades National Park. I pressed him for details of the trip,
and it went in my mind as something to strive to achieve. When my friend
Theron and I [finally climbed it ](http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2004/joburg.htm)we
were forearmed with knowledge from John and another friend Robert Meshew.
Also, John helped us more concretely close to the date, because he discovered
an alternate descent from the mountain that he named "**Dan's Direct**,"
after a friend. We followed his advice and found our way down much easier
that by going the standard way.

And it's like that that John helped us with our house: seeing us safely
through a transaction fraught with worries, especially considering that
we were leaving the country. I called him in mid-September and said "we
want you to sell our house, and by the way, we might be seriously gone
before you manage to do it." I then coolly lit a cigarette.
  
  
Okay maybe that was a little over-dramatized. John helped us work out
a timeline, and helped us find a price that we were happy with and that
would also ensure a fairly quick sale. His photographer spent a lot of
time getting the best light and angles for the pictures. Here are a few
of them:

We put the house on the market quickly, and got a buyer just 2 days later.
Unfortunately it fell through because another family member didn't like
the house a few days later. It took a few more days to get another buyer,
and this person was really motivated (as we were, another thing to be thankful
for). John was right on top of everything, and from here it went without
a hitch. All in all, it went from "wacky idea" in mid-September to a closed
house sale on October 31st.

I knew that if we ended up moving before the house was sold, John would
be a good steward for our real estate business in Washington. He is solid
and trustworthy. If we move back to Washington one day, we'll keep him
busy looking for a place. We also hope he'll come out with his family for
some hiking and climbing in the Eastern Alps wonderland.
