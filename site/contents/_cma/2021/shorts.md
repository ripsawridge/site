### Großer Rauher Kopf
_April 10, 2021_

Tired from the day before, I climbed an incredibly steep road near a place called the
Kastensteinerwand Alm. Then it became a steep trail, made more interesting by
wet, heavy snow and water just like the day before. Wearing these big mountain boots
and lugging snowshoes in my pack is a kind of hard life, especially so today because
everyone on the trail was wearing trail running shoes. I hate the way the soles of
my boots will slip so easily on wet roots -- trail runners are just way better about
that somehow. But anyway, I was the big slowpoke, and got used to finding a good place
off to the side of the trail to let the people pass going up and going down.

### Mittelstaufen
_April 9, 2021_

A hike in the late afternoon, snowshoes on my back. The forest was covered in wet, melting snow, making
deep pools of water held in place on the trail. The trail was called the "Bartlmahd." Shortly below
the summit, a young man ate soup and prepared to bed down for the night. After slogging through deep
snow, it was interesting that the final steep way to the summit was snowfree. Gorgeous sunset views
to the Chiemsee.

I was able to avoid using a headlamp all the way until the last few minutes of the trail.

### Kranzhorn
_April, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked to the summit, what a great day. We talked about love and
religion and everything in between.

### Bike ride to the southeast

[Here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/336107425) is the tour on komoot. 81 kilometers, about a 1000 meters up and down.
Really fun...very long and beautiful, too.

### Osterfelderkopf
_March 25, 2021_

Skied up from the Hausberg parking lot. First time to ski this year. Happily, my foot is okay
in the boot, if a little tight.

### Heuberg
_March 13, 2021_

Barbara and I hiked up on a beautiful day.

### Wildbarren
_March 6, 2021_

With Jong on a snowy day.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

Night hike to the summit and back.

### Wildbarren

Wonderful day, up steeply and down the secondary way to the same trailhead.

### Sulzberg
_March 3, 2021_

With Barbara and a small dog -- much fun!

### Wildbarren

Up steeply, but this time traversing around to the west and the dramatic sub-summit.
From there, the ridge is easily followed (game trail?) to join the trail to the summit near the small pretend-chapel.
Down the secondary steep way. Difficult, muddy time in the forest on steep, icy slope with ice under leaves.

### Heuberg

Night hike to the summit and back, thence to sleep in mountains.
