A [good article](https://americanreformer.org/2023/03/the-deep-heaven-of-the-gay-gods/) in
American Reformer writes about N.I.C.E. and *[That Hideous Strength](https://www.amazon.com/That-Hideous-Strength-Space-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B006L8768O/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=that+hideous+strength+by+c.s.+lewis&qid=1680353660&sprefix=that+hideous+str%2Caps%2C205&sr=8-1)*, the
3rd book in C. S. Lewis' Ransom trilogy. Interesting read. In the second
part he offers a simple, full-throated excoriation of where transgenderism
really comes from and we know it:

I've lost patience with these ideologies. They are sick and disordered.
We are afraid of giving offense so we don't speak up. Meanwhile this is being
pushed on the vulnerable young in a society. The pushers know the young will
cry and be hurt when the society rejects them. And then they want to throw
that hurt in the face of the ones rejecting and say "see? See what you did?"
It is a manipulative game played by evil beings working through disordered
people.

Like everyone else, I know people and have people in my family who are
homosexual. I love them dearly. What I push back on is the "selling" of
an ideology that makes you special and different, even "magical" when compared
with "the normals". It's almost like the transgenders are the magical people
who get to go to Hogwarts, and the normals are the Muggles, those vaguely
stupid beings who muddle through their lives waiting to be saved or damned
by the actions of the only ones who really matter, the elect. The Harry
Potter books are horrible in this regard.

My gay friends and family have never gone around intimating to young
people that their best
future lies in choosing a suddenly fashionable sexual orientation. Because
they are decent human beings. They may not agree with me that the behavior
they practice is an error. But they have my love.

My errors are countless. They are, yes, sins. I put myself into the hands of
the Father. I accept Jesus as my guide. I hope that I sin less by letting
His light fill me, and push away those parts of me still made out of tin,
to use Lewis' analogy of the tin soldier becoming a human, from this
fantastic passage in Mere Christianity:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7RHZ6rued8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The ones I love make many errors. They commit many sins. But real love
is seeing the path opening before the beloved, and seeing them always
stepping into their best selves. "Who are you to judge?!" I can hear.

I am no one special. I only love. I have experiences that tell me what is
likely to be better, yes. These "afflict" me. They influence my opinion.
And so yes, I have an opinion.

I think homosexual practice is "worse," just as I think lustful craving for
the opposite sex is worse. Sexuality is powerful and complex. It is the
primary siren song which led me into my worst errors. These days I try to
live by the dictum "every woman my mother, every girl my sister," and so my
thoughts and gaze on the opposite sex are always chaste and familial.
Have you ever tried to do this? In every single situation?

It is not easy. But it is right. It is best.

Sex is not for us. It is meant to be the sacred, loving, private act which
results in new life on the earth.

So does the homosexual sin? Yes. But they already are born into a world where
everyone else sinned enormously by turning sex into a matter of "personal
pleasure." That error precedes an ocean of error following close behind.

There are other ways to discover this. The bridges back to any kind of
Christian understanding of these topics are burned for millions of people.
They saw too many movies in which the presence of a Bible in the hand means
that the holder is a psychopath. Or they experienced ugly, broken people who
used a church or Bible to spread evil.

The truth is, we have to become adults. Every good thing down here on earth
will be twisted and misused. The worst people align themselves with the best
causes because that is the quickest road to power!

We have to find our way back, carefully side-stepping charlatans of every
stripe. And we have to ask ourselves: am I in error? To what degree, and
who is harmed? Because until we are perfect children of God, we are more
like machines subject to manipulation by the wayward world. Yes, you will
error. All the time. But keep seeing it, keep resolving to improve, keep
your eyes up to Heaven.

If you need a non-Christian way to motivate yourself, consider that Buddhists
recognize that desires, whether fulfilled or thwarted, lead to suffering.
If you have a culture which elevates sex as the rightful way to please
yourself, the rightful desire to stoke and fulfill, then that culture is
following a road to greater suffering. The Buddhist seeks to do his duty
with dispassion, and to find fulfillment in contemplating that which cannot
be named positively, but only in negative terms (it is "not this" and "not that".
It is, frankly, God).

So use *this* tool, and ignore the Christians when they try to explain it.
Use your own mind and see what happens when you imbibe the idea that you
are supposed to go and fulfill your desires. And when, through the images of
our social media, your desires ever multiply.

For the demons await your fall, knowing that the multiplication of desires
means the multiplication of thwarted desire, which means the growth of
anger and resentment in you. Which leads to the burning of bridges of
relationship to those who love you, and the turning to drugs and drink
in order to hide from the pain rising within. And finally you are all alone.

Where you can easily be made worse.

## A defense of Christian teaching by Calvin Robinson

I've started this video from *Pints with Aquinas* at about 8 minutes in
where they react to Calvin Robinsons speech:

## Divorcing America

America is already divorced, they just continue living in the same house because
it's too difficult to move out. The left has moved on from "hateful" concepts
like a Christian God, and are eager to walk the roads other societies have
already trodden well (Russia, China, Cuba, etc). The right hopes they can
keep going about their lives in the old ways that worked for their parents and
grandparents. An Australian presenter, John Anderson, interviews an American
author and theologian Douglas Wilson.
