Rowan did some funny stuff. For example at night he gets his blanket over
his feet and announces that it makes up a kind of shoe. Then he puts his
legs in the air and pistons them quickly, announcing "running." Then he
slows his pace down and says "walking."
  
  
He wrote a song too. Well sorta. If we play the piano he'll go to the
lower half, say "George" (meaning Curious George) and begin playing a singular
piece. Any note will do, but he plays one note at a time in a quarter note
staccato rhythm, gradually going down to end on the last note of the keyboard.
For symmetry, he'll say "George" again.
