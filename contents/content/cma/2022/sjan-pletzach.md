Very interesting hike. Steeply up to a small (inhabited!) cabin
in a meadow with a Charlie-Brown-esque Christmas bush, then
on a steep road and trail to the Pletzachkogel summit. From
there over to a kind of abandoned ski area compound, and with
snowshoes steeply up to the high abandoned lift station.
I peered inside the windows of the adjoining hut to see a rack
of kettleballs and "WOD" (workout of the day) notations on a
chalkboard. It's some kind of revanchist "body kultur" hideout!

I'm only kidding -- seems really cool. Anyway, the final climb
to the summit of the Roßkogel was interesting. I scrambled up
a rocky ridgecrest with a rather difficult step. Meanwhile an
extremely agile man came bounding down the ridge and batmanned
through the latschen trees in an area of similar difficulty
20 meters to my left. In fact, I saw many people this day (8 or 10?).

Aside from the radio tower on the summit, it's a neat place.
There are likely no better viewpoints of Guffert.

1600 meters up and down.

Just above the steep road in the forest, we come out on the slopes
of Pletzachkogel.
