### Kramerspitz and Hirschbühel
_May 10, 2009_

An afternoon hike up the Kramerspitz from Garmisch. I wore Kris's sci-fi GPS
watch for fun. It was cool to see the track later! I went up the steep way from
town, dealing with a fair bit of snow traversing on the north side of the
peak. From a false summit on the ridge:

And now at the summit:

I made a "pano-rama" picture while there:

I decided to go hike up another peak called Hirschbühel. Here she is from Kramerspitz:

But first on the way down I slipped in mud coming out of a standing glissade on snow. Holy cow, I got so soaked and dirty it wasn't funny. So I squelched down to the hut, and then up cross-country to Hirschbühel, connecting with old tracks in snow on it's ridgetop. I had this summit to myself, and looked back at Kramerspitz.

5.5 hours round trip, 5300 feet elevation gain/loss.
