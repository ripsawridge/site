Since our first hike in the range 3 weeks before, Steve and I had been impressed
by Mt. Regan. Between separate travel plans, we had a day to hike up that
peak with a good weather forecast. We'd hike the Southeast Ridge, which
promised 2000 vertical feet of off-trail travel and a bit of 4th class
scrambling at the summit.

We started hiking from the Iron Creek Trailhead at 6 am, slightly dismayed by
clouds in the sky. Within an hour, we could smell smoke, and noted a brown
haze in the air with some alarm. As we approached Sawtooth Lake, some backpackers
coming out told us the smoke was a surprise to them as well. Oh well, we
thought we'd just continue until something stops us.

At the lake, Steve took off, having earned a fitness bonus over the last week
with Ever in Tahoe. We met again below lake 8271, where we crossed the stream
and started contouring up the hill to round the lower cliffs of the
Southeast Ridge, here presenting as a rocky buttress. After a few minutes of
this, we found an opening -- a broad gully less steep than surrounding cliffs.
We started up here, using our hands occasionally and following our noses up
and somewhat left to what appeared to be the ridge crest.

This worked out well. Now we could hike steep terrain on or just left of
the crest for several hundred feet. Higher, we rounded a rocky buttress on
the left, seeing occasional faint signs of passage or use. Another 20 minutes
or so brought us to a point below the final headwall to the summit. We'd
read that we should follow a ledge around the right side of this for up to
50 feet, then turn up. Indeed, we found the ledge, and after checking out
a few options, we picked a likely spot to head up.

After some nice scrambling, we came to a short (5 meters high) step of
5.0 climbing. This was quite fun. Above that, there were no further difficulties,
and we stood on the summit after a few minutes.

The sky was still hazy, but as we hung out on the summit a few minutes it began
to improve. By the time we were back at the car, all traces of fire had
disappeared. Very strange! The views were excellent. The summit log
(in a "Smokey the Bear" lunch-box) recorded the last entry from a year
ago, August 2024. Certainly some others had been up and simply failed to
record their visit. It's useful to record your visits here for mountain
rescue efforts. If you disappear down some strange gully, the note might
be helpful!

We descended easily enough, then quickly reversed the hiking part of the
route. I came to some grief in the broad gully, preferring to stick close
to rock walls and downclimb steeper rock rather than take my chances
tip-toeing down the steep scree. This takes a good bit longer. Eventually,
however, I could rejoin Steve's scree route.

I got some water at the creek, then we rejoined the trail. I met Steve again
briefly at Sawtooth Lake and encouraged him to go check out the pass leading
to the McGown Lakes, as the most inspiring view of Mt. Regan can be
found there. He was so fast, he'd still catch me on the descent. He did that,
and I listened to some podcasts as I descended. My legs and feet were oddly
sore. Somehow, the day had taken a lot out of me. By the time I reached the
car (again, with Steve out in front), I felt quite bad. Oh well, sometimes
that is how it is.

Thanks to Steve and the mountain, another great peak visited!
