### Wank
_May 6, 2006_

I had to try out my exciting new digital camera (a Panasonic LX1) so I got up
early for a hike up "Wank," a view peak for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen
area. I parked my car at a secret trailhead where my friends Mat and Ari live,
and saw that they were still sleeping. "I'll catch them on the way back," I
thought. Despite clear skies in Munich, it was raining here! At least the first
part is in the trees. The trail has been rebuilt around a massive mudslide from
last year. I passed a hut that serves good cakes in the afternoon, and
continued up meadows to the upper half of the trail. The views increased, but
were still rainy and hazy. Finally I reached the summit and admired the
constrained localized views. So much for getting a smashing overview of the
Wetterstein Range pic for Gangolf's page. I contented myself with some
trailside shots on the way down. 2.5 hours round trip, ~1100 meters elevation
gain/loss. Back near the car I dropped in for tea and cookies at my friends
house. This could become a habit!
