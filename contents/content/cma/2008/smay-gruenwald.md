### Grünwald Run
_May 1, 2008_

My neighbor Riki and I ran from near the Deutsches Museum to Grünwald and back.
It was really fun, but man my legs are sore! It was a little more than 12.5
miles according to Google Earth. It rained hard for a few minutes, but then we
got dry and the sun came out for a bit too.
