### Mt. Catherine Loop, Jan 11, 2004
Josh, Dan, Peter and myself had most of the day for some nordic
skiing. The Mt. Catherine Loop seemed like a good idea, with some
trail-less navigation to Nordic Pass.
We managed to fit all four of us with skis in my car,
and drove to the pass. Peter and Dan had beefy AT gear, while
Josh and I had long tele skis and leather boots. We skinned up
into a foggy area, and ended up going a mile the wrong way on
a groomed road. We figured that out, then set off on a snowshoe
trail to reach Frog Lake. Dan got a blister and we scrounged some
duct tape for him from rips in my battered shell jacket. Continuing
southwest on a compass bearing, we made for Nordic Pass, fighting
the occasional problem with skins, bindings, etc. Time was
speeding by, and we almost turned around below the pass, as the
low visibility and casual nature of our travel made us wonder if
we were all turned around somehow. But we were mostly on track, 
hitting the pass just a bit to the north where a great view of
Silver Peak appeared briefly in the fog. Josh and I hiked down
about 100 feet to the pass - steep terrain in dense trees that
Peter and Dan managed to ski. Getting down from the pass was an
adventure. I suffered numerous face-plants, eventually learning to
side-step and traverse the difficulties. Josh gave up and hiked!
We had some time in the sun, then went south over Windy Pass and
took a long coasting ride on a road. My skis with their scales
seemed to be the slowest. We spent a long time on nearly-level
terrain to get back to the car. Dan was worried about being late,
so we hurried quickly back to the Sound. 

It was a fun day with lots of laughs!
