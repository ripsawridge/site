I'm just going to leave this right here for anyone who a) could use a reminder
of what magic we are searching here, or (and I hope there are less of these)
b) people who regard Christian apologists like Lewis as fussy moralists or
logicians, or crusaders.

In "[The Problem of Pain](https://www.amazon.com/C-Lewis-Problem-Pain-1st/dp/B00N4EQXHI/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=cs+lewis+the+problem+of+pain&qid=1638793971&sr=8-5)," he comes to the end, and attempts to describe Heaven.
It is clear that he has touched it not by directly knowing it, but
**by perceiving the exact shape of its absence here.**

We yearn. And must not stop yearning.

This is something meant to be said rather than read. It is best if I speak
it aloud. A part of me normally dormant in the noon-day, stirs and re-members
itself. I hope, meaning...I *expect*, it is the same with you.
