### Hoher Fricken

I was back about a month after hiking up with Peter, enjoying the steep trail
up beside the great waterfalls. Amazingly, the snow depth was
about the same. I could go a bit further without snowshoes, owing to some deep tracks
that were easier to rebuild and punch through than to make new ones. It had been
at least a week since anyone went up, and higher, I was tempted to think that the
remnant tracks were only those left by Peter and I...they were mere dimples in
the snow which had a solid base under several layers of fresher snow. Rebuilding
those was plenty of work, especially near the summit.

I went down towards the Esterbergalm, coming pretty close to it as I descended near
ski tracks, before cutting westward to the tight pass at 1279 m that would lead me
back to Farchant.

### Buchenhain by bike

Elijah and I went for a bike ride to Buchenhain and did some bouldering.
What an amazing place. Elijah also took some pictures of Legos, which came out good!

### Kruezeck

_March 4, 2018_

Evening trip up on skis. Very dark mountain. Beautiful ski down a black run.
Yes!

### Kreuzeck

_March 1, 2018_

Jaro, Camillo, Andreas and I skied up after work. A cold but beautiful evening with
a full moon. It was our first time up here. The ski route took us through a special
tunnel built just for ski touring folk! Pretty hilarious.

We got dinner on the way down at the Restaurant Kreuzalm in the ski area, which was
packed with the ski touring crowd. The way down was fast and icy, but nice.


### Brauneck

_February 18, 2018_

Quick run up in the afternoon. 1.5 hours, I was faster because I didn't take
the slow way around to the Floriansh√ºtte.

### Brauneck

_February 8, 2018_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck this morning in light snow.
I was pretty sweaty because I wanted to keep my jacket on in the snow.
Hmpf! Great run down, one lame fall where I hurt my thumb, a bit.
900 meters up/down.
