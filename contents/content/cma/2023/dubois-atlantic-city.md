There was a full-on hiker bubble in Dubois. People heading north and
people heading south. We set up shop at the Cowboy Cafe, meeting some people
we knew and seeing a lot more (hikers) we didn't know. It was tough to
find a place to stay for the night but we finally succeeded. We'd get
that full zero day I wanted, so we'd be in town two nights.

We met Swede and Whitney, the two Swedish fellows that Cory had gotten
to know during his stretch in the Bob a month or so ago. We ate dinner
together...a big burger, pie and beer, the perfect hiker meal. These two
had some great video footage of the mud we'd walked through and I got their
email addresses to ask for it later (still on my todo list!).

*Burger, beer, pie. The trifecta of delight! Whitney (from Sweden) and Cory.*

I bought some cigars at the gift shop next door (the Water Sheel Gifts and
Books shop). The owner was a really nice lady. She said that the church was
allowing hikers to sleep on cots for free. Oh, if only we hadn't already paid
hundreds of dollars for a room! Ach...but still, the phone number she gave
me for that turned out to be helpful when we left town.

# August 8, Day 129

Nothing to do but sleep in and go shopping, and even that didn't take long
because we had our resupply box from the Benchmark Ranch. Cory was amazing
though, he went out and got breakfast for us both, and I sat up in bed
watching tv and eating the breakfast burrito he brought back. Delicious!

The hours just speed by on rest days like this. You catch up on conversations
with your people far away...you edit pictures...you eat and take care of
laundry. It's over far too soon.

We had to wait awhile to get back into the Cowboy Cafe. Finally we got in and
shared a table with a nice couple and their grandson. We had a great chat
with these folks.

Took a beer home somehow, watched part of a movie, and planned to get up
fairly early to hitch out of town. We'd return to the trail at a turn-off
on the main road with a dirt road that climbs up to Union Pass. The idea here
was to avoid the aggressive grizzly bear stalking people at the pass.
Another surveyor had been charged a bit south of the pass (right on the CDT
trail) and had some injuries. Between that and the grizzly roaming the road
right on the highway, it was easy to accept avoiding the area.

However! It did save almost 20 miles of walking, and I've got a bit of guilt
about that. But I guess I'll live (a sad and broken life).

# August 9, Day 130

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day130.jpg %}
*19.6 miles, 2335 feet elevation gain.*

We had trouble hitching a ride out of town. I suggested we go into a restaurant
for breakfast and strike up conversation with people!

This...didn't work so well. We'd crossed some kind of culture divide by moving
to the west side of town. We were in the Village Cafe, full of older working
folks who didn't particularly take well to the idea of grown men hiking across
a country, by the atmosphere in the place. Well, shucks. So that was a wasted
trip, but we did get more coffee in us and some eggs and bacon, which never
hurts. I sympathized with these folks. So many of "our number" are weed-smokin'
dope-totin' types from big cities, wearin' all their pride-themed clothing.
Depressing evidence of hedonistic cultural rot, we seem to be. Meanwhile these
folks get up early and work hard until health problems finally stop them.
We're the winners. They are not.

It is unfair. And the worst thing about it is, the winners look down on the
losers. Of course, this categorization is *also* false. What makes someone
a winner, when they won't ever hold a grandchild, because they believe humans
are a cancerous growth and we need to depopulate the planet? The joke will
be on them, in the end. But anyhow, in the moment, people have the right
to express their disapproval. Me and Cory were tolerated in this place, but
not welcomed. Fair enough!

Back out on the street, we called the church and one of the ladies there sent
her husband to get us. This nice fella drove us up to Union Pass road about
10 miles west of town. That was super helpful. Thank you sir!

*Michael resting near the small settlement of Du Noir.*

We hiked up the road, happy for the good weather. Memories of rain and mud
won't soon depart!

We met Heather and Mike at a little AWD vehicle rental place, and bought
some snacks, eating them out front. I think I had a Twix Bar and Reese's
Peanut Butter Cups. Mike and I were talking about AI (artificial intelligence),
and we found ourselves disagreeing on each particular subtopic. We traced
it back to a fundamental worldview difference, which was interesting. I
think the world is an expression coming out of a Creator in which we
participate meaningfully (though certainly not with full understanding).
He denies that claim, so his view on AI ends up in a very different place.
I think, in fact, that AI is an expression of a worldview that would simply
be uninteresting in other eras. I'm not interested in it in this era, but
I'm an anachronism (or a forerunner (or both)).

We walked for pleasant hours, at one point me and Heather had a long
conversation. We could faintly see the Tetons in the distance.

*Beautiful open country here...*

We were treated to incredible trail magic! A guy named Tripod drove his
truck out to the red-line of the CDT right at Union Pass. We met some
folks we knew there hanging out and dug in to the hot food Tripod served
up! Spaghetti...!

Fantastic. I got to have two dinners today. We talked of this and that,
then I was the first to leave, knowing that I wouldn't make my miles if
I sat around too long. Cory caught me after an hour in a zone of
cow fields and young forests. The place I wanted to camp was occupied
by a neat older fella who was backpacking his way through the Wind Rivers.
We moved on and found a flat spot in a sloping field. The cows were a
bit unhappy because we were blocking the way they wanted to cross the river.
But they did find a way around. It was interesting that they really wanted
to avoid us. During the evening, a calf and it's mother carried on a long
conversation on two sides of the river.

# August 10, Day 131

*19.1 miles, 2070 feet elevation gain.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/17-DSC05782.jpg %}
*Cory having crossed Gunsight Pass.*

It was an easy walk in the morning up to Gunsight Pass, where we'd get our
first real view of the Wind Rivers Range we've been sneaking up on.
I've thought about this place for such a long time...really wondered what
the country would be like to pass through, and now I'm here. It was great
to see snowy mountains again. We had to drop down a long ways to the
Roaring Fork, then sidehill for miles above the valley floor to reach the
big lake in the Green River near a road terminus and parking lot.
Cory and I walked along listening to music or podcasts. I had the collected
audiobooks of C. S. Lewis, and occasionally pestered him with something
cool that I heard. I particularly liked "The Abolition of Man." He really
knew where we'd end up as a culture.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/23-DSC05795.jpg %}
*Squaretop Mountain ahead. Our camp is under it on the left.*

At the end of the day we were under Squaretop Mountain, which looked to have
some excellent rock climbing routes on it. We found some flat places
and set up camp. A few minutes later Swede and Whitney showed up. We had
dinner together and went to sleep.

# August 11, Day 132

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day132.jpg %}
*19.6 miles, 3300 feet elevation gain.*

We started out roughly together in the chilly morning. At different
times I walked with Swede or Whitney. Well, Whitney was too tall and therefore
too fast. Swede I could just keep up with, though only for a short time.
It's becoming very clear to me that I'm not a fast hiker. I'm quite
slow, I'm afraid!

But he had many interesting observations. Unfortunately, my memory of this
stretch is not strong. I think I was listening to a lot of books and
podcasts. Could it also be that I didn't find the country particularly
amazing?

Well, heck, I guess that is the case. I had built up "the Winds" in my
mind as something amazing. It was nice enough, but it didn't have the
unforgettable drama of Glacier.

We made a few creek crossings. At one point I met Swede and Whitney again
who reported that Cory had fallen right on his face into the creek!
I was worried about his phone, knowing he keeps it in his front pocket.
They showed me a video of the notable event. Looked rough! He was clearly
disgusted, and got up and galumphed away. Out of paranoia, I decided to
just wade this creek instead of rock hop, so I sacrified my dry shoes and
sloshed across the icy cold water.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/29-IMG_20230811_111702_MP.jpg %}
*Green River Pass and Summit Lake.*

Later I met up with Cory in sunny high country. His phone was okay, thank
goodness. We reached the Green River Pass and Summit Lake. High, brown,
grassy country with granite peaks around though well set-back. We had a long
rest sitting at the lake and eating lunch, then set off south on a variant
to the route which would take us more directly to the Elkhart Trailhead
and Pinedale beyond. The CDT heads a few miles off to the east here, but the
country appears similar everywhere. You're walking through scenic bowls
of granite with lakes and light forest no matter which way you go.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/32-20230811_170221.jpg %}
*Michael starts down with Fremont Lake in the distance.*

We went by Borum Lake, Gottfried Lake, two large but unnamed lakes, then Trail
Lake. Then Trapper and Little Trapper Lakes, followed by an unnamed pass
in old forest, then Prospector Lake. Finally a walk on a forested arm above
Glimpse Lake to a viewpoint called the Crows Nest Lookout. From here we
saw a deep chasm we'd have to cross before climbing up and out again on
the other side to the Elkhart Trailhead. We decided that we'd sleep down
in the chasm and climb out in the morning for a hitch to Pinedale.

We could also see the large and impressive Fremont Lake here which guards
access to Pinedale. The descent was steep, sometimes hard to find and
often sandy or rocky on something called the Pine Creek Canyon Trail.
At the bottom it started sprinkling a bit. We crossed Pine Creek and
found a broad flat place to camp. Since the rain was starting, I wanted
to stay here. We did so, enjoying dinner and going to bed. A brother and
sister came by, having made an ambitious bushwhack to a remote lake
where they said fish were extremely abundant.

# August 12, Day 133

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day133.jpg %}
*3.6 miles, 1820 feet elevation gain.*

In the morning the trail didn't make it easy on us, as there were quite
a few blow-downs to climb over, under or around. After Long Lake, we
traversed south then started climbing, almost 2000 feet in total to
reach the Elkhart Trailhead.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/35-20230812_071024.jpg %}
*Long Lake.*

We got up there then hitched a ride with no trouble at all. We'd heard this
was a busy trailhead and it really was. Lots of friendly folks.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/36-IMG_20230812_114236_MP.jpg %}
*In the hostel, admiring a fish drawn by Tim, last seen in Montana.*

There is a pretty new hostel in Pinedale (the Jackalope Motor Lodge). We went there and booked 2 nights.
Only $40 per night, which was fantastic. We had little bunks that could be
completely closed off like tiny Tokyo hotels, with wifi, a lamp and power
inside to charge your phone. There was a hot shower, and the supermarket
was just 5 minutes walk away. We visited the Heart and Soul cafe several
times -- I loved their coffee.

# August 13, Day 134

Zero day!

Nothing to do, really. Oh, a new pair of shoes arrived for me along with
some insoles. Did our shopping and laundry at the hostel. I think we
got Chinese food for dinner, which was okay. On the first night we went to
Los Cabos for mexican food and that was quite good.

Chatting with people at the hostel, calling my sister and Barbara. Stuff
like that. A good break!

# August 14, Day 135

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day135.jpg %}
*17.5 miles, 3350 feet elevation gain.*

It was tough to get out of town. We tried hitching for a good long while.
We starting leaving voice messages on a couple of phone numbers we got
from the FarOut app. Finally though, a friendly man in a pick-up truck
pulled up. I didn't recognize him at first, but we'd talked to him already
two days before in the Ridley's parking lot. He'd come up on a bike then,
but now he was doing the proper Wyoming thing of being in an enormous
truck with a cowboy hat.

Very interesting man, clearly with a long history here. I kinda thought he
was the mayor, or had been. He got us up to near the trailhead then the
road was closed. A woman held a stop sign and walked up to us. Our driver
knew her, her children, her parents, everything about her. He was a guy
who enjoys people and keeps his finger on the pulse of the whole community.

*Sunset panorama at Hat Pass (10848 feet).*

But by now it was 11 am, and we had wanted to hike a full day. So we took
off quickly, first walking the road so that our driver could turn around and
go back instead of waiting to drive us the last 1/2 mile. At the trailhead
there were some Jehovah's Witnesses. I thanked them for their effort to
share the spiritual life with people. I used to find such folks annoying,
now I'm touched that they try! Nice folks.

We walked quickly up to Photographer's Point and enjoyed the view. Lots of
folks here. I'd say this was the most crowded section of trail ever, even
more crowded than the trail above Many Glacier so long ago in Montana.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/41-IMG_20230814_202715_MP.jpg %}
*More sunset...*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/42-DSC05831.jpg %}
*The evening light was beautiful here.*

We spent the afternoon walking briskly by one lake after another, probably
a dozen named lakes in total. In the evening we stopped below Hat Pass
and ate our dinner. It got cold up here quickly.

We hiked a final 30 minutes to the pass and set up our tents here. Shivering
a bit, I crawled into the sleeping bag and conked out for the night.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/43-DSC05834.jpg %}
*More.*

# August 15, Day 136

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day136.jpg %}
*23 miles, 3030 feet elevation gain.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/45-DSC05838.jpg %}
*We passed by so, so many lakes.*

If yesterday had many lakes, today would almost double that total. If you're
a fisherman this must be an absolutely paradise.

*Hiker traveling in to the High Route.*

I don't have much to say about the day. Cory and I traveled separately
quite often. I'd said I wanted to program more alone time on the trail.
I found that no matter how scintillating my company is (and Cory was
always great company), my thoughts were too-occupied by my partner in
grime. I wanted to untether those thoughts and let them float free. The
best way to do that seemed to be to agree on where we would camp, then
let our paces diverge naturally. Usually, Cory hikes a bit faster than me,
unless it's a steep downhill, where I can get ambitious. But then he
prefers longer breaks than I do. At any rate, we diverged and I got the
quiet time I was looking for. We'd do this again over the rest of the trip.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/53-DSC05875.jpg %}
*Again in the last western light.*

We turned onto the side trail off the main CDT that marks the Cirque of the
Towers variation. This was a must-do for me. I've taken so many short cuts,
I've walked so many roads just to make things a little bit easier. But I
very much came for this section of trail. I arrived at Shadow Lake to find
Cory stressing out and wondering if I'd passed by. The problem was that
he'd assumed I was ahead of him all the time, but at some point he walked
by me when I was resting. I called out hello but he had headphones in and
didn't hear. Haha...

The sunset at this lake was fantastic. There was an interesting lady who
had many things to say about hiking and her habits. She and her group were
slowly crossing the range, traveling about 10 miles a day. She couldn't
believe how much food Cory and I needed. I didn't say anything, but perhaps
the difference between what she eats and what we eat has something to do with
the fact that we try and do twice as many miles in a day!

We chatted a lot with a nice fella and his dog who camped right near us.
A good, long day.

# August 16, Day 137

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day137.jpg %}
*13.7 miles, 3750 feet elevation gain.*

Hiking in high alpine country -- what a joy!

*The steep ascent to Texas Pass.*

But a lot of work, too. The climb up Texas Pass is very
steep. But not as long as I thought it would be. Soon we
were sitting on top looking at the towers in the Cirque.
It's unfortunate that there are so many pictures of this place!
Let me add a few more...

*Incredible peaks in the Cirque...*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/59-DSC05894.jpg %}
*Cory under the iconic Pingora Peak.*

We descended, eventually navigating dirt and tree roots *very*
steeply down to Lonesome Lake. Here we stayed on the left
side of the lake on a mix of trail and cross country terrain
amid boulders to then climb up heather and bouldery slopes
to a point west of Jackass Pass. That pass is several hundred feet
higher, but our lower (unnamed) pass would still get us to Arrowhead
Lake. It was also called the climbers trail. We didn't see any tents,
but we could hear voices of climbers on the amazing walls above us.

We picked our way through huge granite blocks under War Bonnet Peak,
then followed a more reasonable trail at the outlet of Arrowhead Lake.
Descending further, we met North Lake, then rather tiredly climbed
above it on trail called the Big Sandy Trail.

In here I chatted with a young man on a climbing trip. He told me
about the famous routes. Now we dropped down to Big Sandy Lake and
took a long rest at it's eastern shore.

*Looking back to Texas Pass.*

Following advice for a scenic variant, we climbed up into mature forest to
the Clear Lake Resevoir, which had amazing views of novel peaks to the south.
We walked the Clear Lake Trail up long granite sidewalks to the stunning
Deep Lake.

Here, a long rest and a nap until the clouds came in and chilled me.
Cory took off first. The hike up to a broad pass above Temple Lake tired
me out so much! I just wanted to sleep in here...

However, some combination of wind, clouds and the drama of Temple Peak with
it's hanging glacier woke me up. We traversed a high route above the
lake, then climbed very steeply to a pass (Temple Pass?). This was just
as steep as Texas Pass, but twice as long, I'd say.

It took some effort to find the way down from the pass, but soon we were
traversing down steep sandy slopes into the Little Sandy valley. Here we
lost the trail for about two miles, but it didn't matter that much.
We knew we were parallelling the trail, perhaps on the opposite side of the
creek. We wanted to get down further then camp. We found a flat place
and set up camp.

Wow, I was beat solid. Only 13.7 miles, but it felt like 25.

# August 17, Day 138

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day138.jpg %}
*19.6 miles, 2445 feet elevation gain.*

This day began in a crabby way. Poor Cory had injured himself the day
before, somehow twinging something in his hip. For a few reasons he
was up long before me and was waiting for me to get up. I found that hard
to take, and stormed off to the bathroom saying something like "well I'd better
hurry then!" I had to go in a serious way, then ruined the morning by
somehow choosing a place to go where someone else did, and I dug up their
waste with my shovel. Oh what a mess.

I came back, irritated further that Cory had continued to wait for me while I
was doing my business around the corner. He was sitting there getting cold.
"I'll need a long time to be ready!" I said, indicating that I felt pressured
and squeezed somehow. Really, he was sitting still because his hip hurt.
So we were just completely out of touch with each other on this difficult morning.

BREATHE!

Finally walking, and warmed up, I could relax and escape the hothouse of stress
I'd built for myself. Cory told me about his hip and I was humbled for having
thought everything is all about me (as usual).

The trail climbs up to a hanging arm to escape the narrow slot that the main
watercourse becomes. After the lake up here, we lost the trail and fell into
a difficult and occasionally stressful bushwhack. We ended up far away from
the official trail, down amid weeds and boulders at the north shore of Little
Sandy Lake.

We followed a game path up into steep boulders and cliffs above the lake,
going up and down, always trying to go south and reach the lake outlet.
Often the climbing required us to use our hands, sometimes we had to
backtrack, too, getting cliffed out on occasion.

Cory was patient and just kept nosing forward, while I hated how much energy
this was taking. I don't think we ever found the official trail again in this
area, we just followed bits and pieces of things, some marked on the map,
some not.

After a decent rest at the lake outlet, we climbed up through forest and
boulder to get a glimpse back on the lake. What a mess! Comments in the
FarOut app indicated we weren't the only ones to find this area difficult.

The rest of the morning and early afternoon were spent climbing to an
unnamed pass, then a rapid descent on the other side to low, hot, sagebrush
country and a parking lot.

We'd been walking separately since the lake outlet, but we both saw the
curious sight of 7 men carrying gallon jugs, rather well dressed, walking up
the road. At the bottom of the road was a campground and area marked
Sweetwater Gap. We rested in the shade of the creek as a couple of
northbound CDT hikers came by. We then curved along the Sweetwater River
in a narrow canyon before climbing up an eastern slope and turning
mostly east for long traverses of hot sagebrush arms marked by chittering
grasshoppers bombing across our paths in the sun.

This went on for hours and hours, heading east and southeast. Finally we
turned back northeast and the sun relented a bit. We listened to mournful
cows in the distance and found a few flat spots by the East Sweetwater River.
It started to rain lightly. Another hiker came long from the south, and
set up his tent on the other side of the river. Cory worried a bit about
dead trees here. Me, I just conked out. It had been a difficult day.


# August 18, Day 139

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day139.jpg %}
*18.5 miles, 2100 feet elevation gain.*

At South Pass City we'd pick up our resupply boxes. I could also get rid of
my bear spray and bear bag. Fantastic!

But there was a fair bit of work to do. We climbed slowly for a couple of hours
to an indistinct pass in a country of forested hills with the occasional
granite outcrop. Another hiker came and passed us like we were standing
still. Once over the pass I hoped we could descend, but there was another hour
of up and down before we really started going down. Here, the country turned
to roads and open grassland. Cory was off ahead and I enjoyed the solitude.

*Looking down to South Pass City and our resupply box.*

It was quite fun to start getting some perspective on the Winds, and see the
great plain of the Basin out beyond and below us. In fact that had dominated
the view the day before as well. I came to the highway and crossed it,
perking up for the few miles to South Pass City. What would that place be
like?

Well, it was nice enough. A little souvenir shop which sold candy and soft
drinks. Cory and I took turns going in and buying each other another type
we hadn't tried yet, while we wrestled with our resupply boxes.

Our plan was to camp here for the night, but it was quite hot and uninteresting
here. We realized that we could walk to Atlantic City, get a hot meal,
and get a leg up on the hiking for the next day. Awesome!

So we set out on the road to Atlantic City. Just as we left Swede and Whitney
appeared. They'd had a break in Lander. In fact, many people went to Lander.
I didn't want to go there because I thought the hitch would be difficult.

Cory and I walked companionably to the 'City. Once there, we went into the
Miner's Grubstake restaurant. What a treat this place was. Burgers and beer,
and lots of funny comments from the owner who affected a kind of Mae West
personality. We walked over to the campground afterwards and for a few bucks
got a laundry, a shower, wifi and power charging in addition to a place to
put our tents.

Wind and rain in the evening.
