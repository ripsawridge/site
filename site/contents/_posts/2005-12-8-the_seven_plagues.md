It's been plague season (small household edition) for us, as a gathering
storm, feeding on itself, frenzied by declining immunities and a feeling
of driftlessness, whips around our home. Unmoored from our old home, and
with nothing to attach to or imprint on here, the days are long and filled
with crying or heartbreakingly, a despondent silence that might be a real
virus or "merely" a spirit overwhelmed. The cornerstones of our existence
as a family are apparently:

1) The Internet in the home.
  
2) A soft floor or carpet for the boys to play on.
  
3) Furniture, with a soft floor or carpet for the adults to lay on.
  
4) The "little things," of which we have none.
  
5) A phone - at least we have that now, it is something.
  
6) Health of the adults, health of the boys, all shaky.
  
  
Tuesday I reeled in a twilight world of shivering and vomit. Work needs
me every hour I can spare. Home needs me even more. I'd better pay the
former to support the latter. Damn - a wasted day is too costly! Elijah
might have the same sickness, he is averse to eating and usually despondent.
Rowan is teary but at least hungry. Kris started feeling sick last night,
getting that woozy feeling. She has summed it up with the pithy and ironic
phrase: "_we're living the dream_."
  
  
Kris has great gallows humor.
  
  
I hope she doesn't get as sick as I did. I hope Elijah recovers today.
If Rowan can hold on where he is that will be good. Meanwhile, I'm getting
a sore throat. With an immune system sufficiently compromised to cause
me to shiver in my greatcoat I worry about the cost of that.
  
  
_Whipped by the plague winds! Battered by pestilence!_
  
  
I know we'll weather the storm, but wow it's something to see.
