<h3>Friday</h3>


I left the town, again with some pilfered bread and butter for lunch. I walked
along a bisse. This is a really cool stream beside a trail made long ago so
farmers could irrigate their fields. The water bubbles along right next to you,
sometimes slightly raised above the trail giving a pleasant feeling of
cultivated nature. Later I saw where little wooden gates in the water were used
to divert a portion from the main stream to the bisse. Really neat!


I hiked up into a valley, the Val d'Arpette, with "entry level" peaks of the
Mont Blanc Range on the left. In the forest I admired a granite boulder that
reminded me of boulders on the Mountaineer's Creek approach to Colchuck Lake in
Washington State. It had been a year since I'd seen such granite, and I missed
it. Rocky peaks of Clochers d'Arpette loomed on the right, looking very much
like the Condor Buttress area of Icicle Creek (again in Washington State). It
was a real nostalgia walk.


I saw a few people as the terrain steepened, but then after crossing a
boulderfield near the head of the valley, I came on a crowd of 40 people. For
the first time, I was seeing the crowds I'd heard of. I didn't mind at all
though, that is until they became dangerous!

As we all headed up to the pass, I continually passed people on little side
trails. I thought maybe I was being a little rude, but then when the rocks
started falling I felt justified. Somehow, various people on the trail were
adept at prying large rocks loose and sending them down on their companions with
cries of "doitors!" I didn't know what the word meant, but it was more dangerous
than many mountain climbs. Even children were leaping and dodging the boulders
knocked loose. Once the rock fell, everyone would settle back to climbing. Only
to be alarmed moments later when someone knocked another rock loose! By now I
was well to the side, practically rock climbing to avoid the circus. I guess you
really learn how to walk on such terrain, I couldn't remember having such
trouble.


At the pass I loved the view, and needed to get clear of the crowds for a
while. I scrambled up a granite summit to the south. I made a few 4th and 5th
class moves to reach the summit. I felt my balance restoring looking up at the
massive Aiguille du Tour and the icefall spilling down from the Plateau du
Trient. This place was a wonderland. Back among the crowd at the pass, I said
"howdy" to a man who giggled inanely in response. He was probably seeing his
worst nightmare of a cliched American come to life. Whatever. Or maybe he was on
drugs. Somehow I'd gotten accustomed to wending my quiet way alone, without
people. And now they seemed strange to me.

I passed everyone on the way down the valley, admiring the opposite valley wall
where I'd spend the afternoon hiking. I bought a sandwich at a restaurant down
in the valley, then started hiking slowly up the opposide side of the creek. It
was very hot. I reached a little hut at a place called Les Grands, then
contoured away from a spectacular glacier view (Glacier des Grands) for a nice
walk with a view town to the town of Trient. Continuing, I entered the valley of
Nant Noir, and saw the French border above me at Col de Balme, marked by a large
house where I planned to sleep.


More walking brought me there, pretty tired after a long day of hiking. I was
saddened to see the hut didn't have potable water, as I was out and should have
filled up at a stream before. The warden showed me to my room, which was
freezing cold! After going outside to warm up and admire the crazy view of Mont
Blanc, I was back in the room wearing thick gloves and trying to re-warm my
hands. I called Kris on the phone to say I'd be in Chamonix tomorrow. But life
at home was not going well!

We had to move out of our place for two weeks while ceilings were repaired. Kris
got a look at the apartment we'd move to, and it was terrible. Completely unsafe
for the kids, and too small. Actually, we wanted 2 rooms, one for us and one for
the kids. What we got was a one room apartment on the first floor, and another
one room apartment on the fourth floor. This in a kind of run-down building near
the university that didn't inspire confidence. What kind of logic is that? We
can't leave 18 month old babies in a room of their own 3 floors away! Kris was
pretty upset.


That's it. I'm coming home. I was mad about the apartment situation, and not
pleased with the hut either - expensive but cold, cheerless, and just as
expensive as a hotel in the valley with hot water and heat. I quickly packed up
and left.


My right knee and left heel were really sore, but I hobbled down through ski
lifts. It wasn't the ending I expected. I just really wanted to be home now, as
I was needed. The kids would babble on the phone and cry when I had to hang
up. Rowan asked his mom for me by holding a pretend phone to his head and making
the sign language for "daddy." Aww!


Down in Le Tour I started hitchhiking and right away a really nice woman stopped
for me. She was driving a shuttle van, but gave me a free ride anyway. She was
kind of a full-time snowboarder. Suddenly I was in downtown Chamonix. After 30
minutes I found a place to stay (the Richmond, I think). It had good rooms, a
hot shower and was cheap. I ate dinner at a chinese food restaurant and watched
the sun leave the slopes of Mont Blanc.

<h3>Saturday</h3>


I didn't have much to do, though the fine morning convinced me to take a lift up
to the summit of Le Brevent. I envied some english guys with climbing gear going
to climb a multi-pitch route on the peak. I felt out of rythym, and sad to not
be getting up and hiking due west another day. Clouds came in quickly, and I
left my perch on a little summit when the rain started. Back in town I read and
waited for my train to Zermatt. I needed to take a leak at the train station but
they didn't have a bathroom. What's up with that? I found "a way," though the
station authorities wouldn't be happy with me. You know, I don't understand all
the "Welcome to Chamonix!" signs when there is no public restroom in a
trainstation, where people of all ages have to wait.


Chamonix wasn't "as bad" as I thought it would be from the point of view of
crowds or stuck-up alpinists or some such thing I'd read about somewhere. Though
my heart wasn't in being there, so I can't say too much about it.


The trains took about 4 hours, then I got my car and retrieved my hidden gear
(yes!) near St. Niklaus. I started the drive home at 7 pm, and was home at 1
am. Whew!
