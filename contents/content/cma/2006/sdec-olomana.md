## Olomana Scramble
_December 26, 2006_

Rode a rusty bike from the parents house out there, and had to leave it at the
country club gate. Through rain up into fog to the first summit. Down and up to
the second, boy are the rocks slippery when wet! Fairly new ropes are installed
to get down from the second summit to the third. After bonking my head on a
tree I headed up the third summit, which felt like a real alpine climb! The
clouds parted slightly, revealing an imposing ridge. Later, the clouds lifted
even more, showing how far down the ground was! Despite the weather, it was a
lot of fun.
