A handful of pictures from a really long day trip.  Chris, Jake and I climbed
well over 8000 feet in a day, driven forward by the amazing scenery in this
forgotten area of the Cascades.


![This is Buck Mountain from the trail into Chiwawa Basin. There is a 5th class climb
up the glacier and into the rock band on the skyline. Let's go!](images/buckmtn.jpg)

![Chris is climbing down some steep snow while Jake waits his turn. The scramble up
Fortress Mountain was pretty exciting!](images/downfste.jpg)

while Jake and Chris took a more direct gully.](images/chiwawas.jpg)

are behind him.](images/finalslope.jpg)

the Lyman Glacier is directly below us, here on Chiwawa Mountain's summit.](images/bonanza.jpg)
