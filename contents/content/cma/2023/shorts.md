### Heimgarten
_January, 2023_

A fun hike after staying overnight with Alexander in Weilheim for his birthday
celebration. Lots of fresh snow, and snowing on and off. Up the normal route,
where folks at the Murnau DAV Huette invited me in to eat lunch! Down via
the long ridge, sometimes breaking trail in deep snow.

### Stanser Joch
_January 7, 2023_

I'd never done the hike straight up from the town of Stans. It was fantastic!
I thought it would be 1500 meters up through *latschen* but it was pleasant,
if very steep, forest and occasional meadow. Only in the last 300 meters were
there periods of time spent in the *latschen*, and of course the final 150 meters
were wide open. I enjoyed a chat with a woman who lived in Schwaz, hiking up
here from home, preferring not to drive anywhere.

### Scheffauer
_January 6, 2023_

A great hike up Scheffauer from the south. I carried snowshoes up to the point
it was clear I didn't need them. I was glad for hiking boots on tricky, icy
steep parts in the last 200 meters to the summit. Beautiful day. Pictures to
come...

### Plessenberg
_January 1, 2023_

A great hike up Plessenberg from the Ascherj√∂chl, then down the west side
to the Jocheralm and to the ground. I listened to the great album
[Static Deviations](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1) by Jameson Nathan Jones.
