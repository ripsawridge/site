Barbara, Rowan, Elijah and I went climbing. After some initial top-roping, Barbara and I went
over the top from the 2-pitch route on the right side of the high crag. Rowan and Elijah
did some climbing with us, then I sent them over to work on the wonderful grade 3 gully.
Actually I put up a rope first, but my thought is that in the future they should be able
to lead/rig that route themselves soon. It has everything! Abseil practice, anchor
practice, and a little bit of runout on the right side (harder) variant of the route.

We met Lenka and Igor over on that neat route on the left side of the high crag (I forgot
the name...too lazy to get the book). Igor had led the route. They graciously let me
lead it with their draws in place. It's such a fun climb! Barbara was thinking of my boys
who had decamped to the car already, so she demurred on following the route. I will bring
her back posthaste, because this route, especially the "extension" from the sub-anchor
that Lenka and Igor noticed is very good. Barbara, the boys and I repaired to the Maxlrain
just as we did a week ago, and monopolized the playground after a great lunch.
