Time for a long climbing vacation...

I flew to Boise on the first, Steve picked me up. The next day we drove
down to Elba to stay with his buddy Duane. This will be a special trip.
I guess I'll make trip reports every few days...already climbed many
pitches, I'm in danger of forgetting the glorious granite. Already have
many impressions of amazing people. Hopefully I can do justice to the
gift of the whole thing.

## July 3

We started things out right when Steve put me on the sharp end for
"**[Strawberry Fields (5.9)](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/115409340/strawberry-fields)**", one of Duane's routes on Elephant Rock. I hadn't been climbing much in the
last few months, so my toes and fingertips started their conditioning right
here.

This is a wonderful climb. Tough slab moves at the start, then a slight
overhang at a rectangle of white rock marked by gunshot wounds. I went
left above this, then on TR later I went right of a hueco below the
anchor.

Then we moved over to the Radicella crag for "Whim-Z" and "Petrodactyl" (both
5.7). We met up with Duane and Dotti to do laps on these nice pitches.
In the years since Steve and I climbed together, he's become a keen
route-setter, and these routes were a nice introduction to his style.
It's all about fun, "whimsy," and safety. Steve is in the game for the
long term.

It got hot, so we repaired to the general store in Elba for ice cream,
then drove up to Lake Cleveland, which we walked around. Then sat on the
summit of Mount Harrison and had a long chat with a local guy.

## July 4

Today we headed out early to climb "**Oh My Gosh (5.7/8)**" on Castle Rock,
another route from Duane. Two amazing pitches! Then we did a bunch of
routes on the Egg Wall, also from Duane. They were:

* Holy Moly - 5.9
* Eggstra Special - 5.8
* Bacon Slab - 5.8
* Scrambled - 5.7
* Stage Left - 5.9

How cool is it that we climbed these things, then repaired to Duane's place
for an incredible home cooked meal? That man can cook. A combination
of spices and fresh vegetables that I never had before...

We heard no fireworks (too much fire danger), but I never felt more
proud to be in my country than I do now.

Strangely, I didn't love America until I left it. Or maybe I simply didn't
know. What I felt. Who I was and am.

## July 5

Another early start! This time back to the 'City for the **Drilling Fields**,
where we climbed more routes from Duane:

* True Spirit - 5.7
* Tourist Season - 5.7
* End Game - 5.8
* Last of the Lost - 5.9
* Chimney to the Sky - 5.9
* Time After Time - 5.4

Basically, I'd lead up a route, then Steve would do it with draws in place.
Then he'd put up a lead, and I'd re-lead with the draws in place.
All of these were excellent climbs, featuring a lower angle slab, then
a sometimes rather alarming steepening wall that becomes a face climb with
occasional "plates" to grab just when it seems impossible.

Next, Steve put me on his climb "**[Aurora (5.9)](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/125918697/aurora)**". We just did the first pitch today.

I hung on the rope a couple times, first at a tricky slab move, then
when I had to transition to a blank-looking slab left of some good holds
I was relunctant to say goodbye to. I followed the pitch again, then worked
on those cruxes, thinking next time I can get it clean. I'll be back! I'm
also interested in the pitches above.

Then, I got a trial by fire on "**Chimera (5.10a)**", which I couldn't finish.
I was doing a chimney technique, but couldn't escape it. We sent Steve up
who made it look easy. I followed the route, enjoying it very much but
still struggling with the lower part. This one will take some work for me...

*TR still in progress, hopefully some pictures to come, though we've been
too busy to take many*

## July 6

Today we climbed a great 3 pitch route called "**Zinger (5.8)**" in *Hostess Gully*
at Castle Rocks. Steep walls were defanged by amazing plates and chicken-heads.
This was a real favorite for me. We'd been concerned about cold, since the area is
shaded, but the wind stayed low so it was fine. We made 3 rappels to the base,
on a line of anchors climbers left of the climbing line.

Then we walked over to the *Crack House*. We did 3 trad lines here -- each of us
led the climb, cleaned the gear, then the other guy would do the same.
This is a great way to get maximum practice placing gear and crack climbing,
something I don't get much of in Old Europa!

First "**Gargoyle Gardens (5.7)**", a delightful but too-short climb with a mix
of cams and offset nuts for pro.

Second, "**No is Hard to Say (5.8)**", a long pitch we were worried that we
couldn't lower off of with a 70 meter rope. But it worked fine. A nice adventure
with large gear, which I quickly ran out of, having to get creative in the upper
section below the anchors.

Third, "**Dark Rock, Good Rock (5.8)**", probably the friendliest of the routes
for its nice stances at each protection point. Though it did have a sustained
multi-move hand and foot crack (at least the way I did it!). I climbed to the
top of the tower, then had to downclimb 15 feet and go off to the right
for the anchor. Cleaning the route was tough because I had a near-horizontal
traverse from the anchor over to my last piece at the base of the final crack.
Steve also found that anchor awkward and began thinking through the administrative
processes of adding one right above our line!

We'd done enough for the day, but I had just enough in me to climb
"**Jug-a-Lug (5.10a)**", a line that Steve encouraged me to climb. This was
so much fun -- entirely too short, and very, very good! Overhangs and delicious
well-formed plates.
