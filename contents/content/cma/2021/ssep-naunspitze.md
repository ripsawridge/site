Jakob and I hiked up the Naunspitze. He brought a vintage Nikon camera with filters and fixed focal
length lenses. What a pleasure to look through the viewfinder! It conjured up prior worlds, that I only
know through television from the 1970s. A curious washed-out look that made me think of the problems 
and pleasures of
life in West Berlin in the 1970s for some reason. Jakob was a quick hiker and had to be patient with
my slow, plodding pace. We talked about politics and the environment, about living in the right places
in the right way. Thanks Jakob!

Wonderful picture Jakob got of me on the summit. I like my portrait a lot!
