Still off the natural high from the Matthes Crest...(see the day before)...
Michael and I set off to climb another of the areas most famous features. 
The Fairview Dome is the largest wall in Toulumne Meadows rising nearly 
1000ft. from base to summit. The rock is of course stellar, and although 
polished on the first pitch, the route delivers pitch after pitch of 
unforgettable crack climbing. 


Our strategy for the route was to wake up late and hopefully the "crowds" 
would be far enough in front of us that they would pose little problem 
in our attempts of finishing the route. So we had a leisurely morning 
waking up around 9 to the lovely California sun drenching or sleeping 
bags. We read and talked to two nice guys who had climbed the route 
the day before and had been troubled by the "hordes." They thought 
our approach was a good one to wait out the morning in hopes our speed 
would see us off the wall before the afternoon thunderclouds rolled. So 
around 10 we drove into the park and stopped at the Toulumne grill for 
breakfast/lunch and to buy some snacks for the climb. They sure do cook 
up a mean chicken sandwich! We got to the parking lot around 10:30 and 
started hiking to the base eager to get a look at the route to see about 
the crowds (you can't get the best view from the road...the trees block most 
of the route from view. To get the best view of the face, hike up the 
opposite side of the road a ways and you will be rewarded with awesome 
views). 


To our pleasant surprise as we reached the edge of 
the forest we saw one party three pitches up and thats it! "Wow we really 
lucked out!" So we hurried to the moat to secure our spot. The moat was 
a grungy, uncomfortable spot. We ended up placing two nuts to hang on in 
our harnesses while we switched shoes and geared up for the first pitch. 
The first pitch had been on both our minds for some time 
now. I had told Michael earlier in the day he should take it. I thought it 
was a generous thing to do and I was...well...kind of intimidated by the 
sustained 200 ft. of 5.9 climbing. As it turned out I wasn't alone on this 
one. Michael started up the pitch and two moves up he put in a piece and 
hung. "Man this is hard Aidan!" He didn't want to give up so he gave it 
another gallant effort but alas nerves got the best of him. He climbed 
down to our little stance frustrated at himself. "I am sorry 
Aidan I just feel really uncomfortable up there."
I totally understood and told him not to worry about it. So it was up to 
me if we wanted to continue or find something else to climb that day. I 
wanted Fairview. So, I took the rack and started up the pitch, a little 
bit nervous and scared but excited all the same. Finger lock after finger 
lock I became more and more comfortable and after a couple meters I was 
loving every minute of it. The finger locks were all there and although 
is was polished it made the climbing that much more exciting. After awhile I 
came to the crux section where the crack thins and the feet disappear and 
on top of that 10-foot section of crack was wet. I plunged in a blue 
Metolious cam and finger locked my way up. Having a long reach is 
beneficial because you can get above the crux in fewer moves. 



My 
first effort was thwarted by the slimey crack but I sneaked by it 
on my second try but almost slipped out of the crack at one point. 
After that, 5.8 crack climbing brought me to a nice ledge with a tree. 
Our 60m rope just barely made it to the ledge, I think I had about 3 or 
4 feet left. I put Michael on belay and brought him up. He struggled on 
this pitch and just wasn't feeling himself. 
He told me he couldn't lead the next pitch and that I would have to do it. 
I was more than happy to take the lead. I thought that if we got past this 
next pitch Michael would begin to feel better having the difficulties behind 
us. The cool thing about this route is that the first two pitches are the 
hardest and they get progressively easier the higher you get. So I was 
feeling optimistic. I took off past the 5.9 bulge and into the sustained 
5.8 corner that led me past a small roof to a really cool hanging belay. 
I brought Michael up and saw the smile on his face as he climbed past the 
roof. He was loving it. He regained his confidence and after some water 
headed off to tackle the 5.8 block pitch that led us up to Cresent Ledge. 
From there we relaxed a bit and ate some food. 



Since Michael had his 
confidence back and was feeling great I told him he could lead the 
next couple of pitches since I was pretty satisfied with the first two. 
So off he went up this beautiful 5.6 corner to another great ledge 
belay. He brought me up and instantly took off on the next pitch 
which consisted of a cool corner ramp that led to an easy but 
intimidating roof (5.7). Michael, as he always does, styled up the pitch. 
I was greeted by a man from Portland, OR at my ledge while I was 
belaying Michael and we commented on the lack of people on the wall. 
The next pitch was a long 4th class/5th class rightward traverse to 
gain a 4th class gully. Michael brought me up to the belay and I headed 
off on the upper 4th class section of the wall. Every so often we 
encountered a low 5th class step but for the most part it was easy 
going. I popped over the edge and took up the rope as Michael made 
the same moves to the top. We shook hands and we were on top. It was 
3:30, only 4 and a half-hours after we left the base. We were stoked at 
what great speed we made and that we only encountered one other party 
on the wall! Man we lucked out. The party from Portland took our picture 
and we took theirs and off we went done the back slabs of the dome toward 
the forest. The climbers' trail done to the car was beautiful and we looked 
up at climbers on a different route. We reached the car thoroughly 
satisfied with our accomplishment.



What made this climb even more memorable was the real sense of camaraderie 
I felt with Michael. Early in the trip he had helped me get through a 
tough time and I was really glad to return the favor. When he was 
really hating it on the wall and not having fun I took the leads and 
got him through the low he was feeling. It was great to see and 
experience the mental battles we fight with the sport we love. 
Thanks Michael for a great day in the hills...your friendship is priceless.

(Michael) This day started very difficult for me. On the first pitch I was very
concious of a long fall I'd taken a few weeks before on a similar pitch in Leavenworth.
Everything was so polished, and I wanted to sew the pitch up through those
sections. But our rack was really a "5.6 mountain rack" - I'd have to run
it out a lot. In that strange mental calculus, I added that fact to my gut
feeling that I'd fall, and had to abandon the lead. Then when I followed
Aidan's remarkable lead of the pitch, I was astonished to realize it was even harder than
I'd expected! Somehow, this whole thing made me angry with myself, and I
arrived at the belay frazzled, ready to quit climbing for the day.
It's kind of like playing something on the guitar just great, then a few days
later you can't do it? That used to really chap my hide. But as Aidan related,
following another more moderate pitch restored my equilibrium. There is nothing
like a great climbing partner and friend to get you back on track, and realize
there is nothing else you'd rather be doing.
