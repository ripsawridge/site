Pitch one


Thomas and Julia, old friends of Georg, came visiting from the north country. We
decided to climb Octowasunn (7-) on the Vorderer Karlsspize. The grade seemed a
bit burly, but we had our secret weapon, Georg :).

After some initial scrambling, we climbed pitch one, 6+, and rather
exciting. There were some dicey moves in the middle, and a long stretch without
gear. Georg and Julia headed off first, and I followed with Thomas. Happily, I
had a few cams, and used the both in a crack below the anchor. You should
definitely bring some extra gear for this climb, it's not pure bolted sport!

The next pitch at 6 or 6- was just plain fun. Then the crux slab (7-)
followed. I got scared and asked Georg and Julia to drop a rope! So much for my
rock climbing hero badge, LOL. Feeling a bit safer, I enjoyed the pitch a
lot. Really interesting and powerful moves.

Pitch four was 50 meters long, at grade IV+, and felt rather insecure. Georg had to climb down a significant amount on the route-finding adventure. There was only a single bolt and I used all of my little store of gear. Pitch 5 was very nice (I forgot the grade, maybe 5?). We were getting really cold. Georg and I climbed one more pitch, a pretty burly grade 6. Then we all rappelled together. I think three rappels were enough due to the traversing nature of the route.

Thanks to Julia, Thomas and Georg for a great day!
