## Introduction

I had about two weeks, and having already done the whole Green Via Alpina
trail in 2017, I decided to get some portion of the very long Red trail.
Why not start at essentially the same place around Vaduz?

## Day One

A walk from Buchs, Switzerland up to the Gasthof Sücka above the village of
Steg. A little rain in the afternoon.

## Day Two

I left early hoping to get some views before the promised rain started.
I reached the Pfälzerhütte pretty early and drank coffee while it rained
hard outside. Then a mysterious walk in Austria for an hour or so before
dropping into Switzerland at the Gross Furgga (2358 m). With beautiful views
the rest of the way to my destination for the night at the Schesaplana Hütte.

## Day Three

This would be a long day. I walked a long time through such amazing country,
especially enjoying the Schweizer Tor. I had a long rest at the Carschinahütte,
talking to a Japanese couple who really liked this part of Switzerland.
Then I walked by the Carschinasee and down to Sankt Antönien where I stayed
for the night.

## Day Four

This day was pretty easy...just go up to the pass and down into Gargellen.
I needed to buy hiking poles and sunglasses, which I could do there.
I also hiked up the Ronggspitze.

## Day Five

Again, not too terribly long. I walked up the beautiful "warm valley" and then
to the Tübinger Hütte, coming into the Silvretta Range and leaving the Rätikon
behind for good.

## Day Six

Today was a long one. First in light rain up to the Hochmadererjoch, then
rather tiredly to the Bielerhöhe for a long lunch. Finally, in decent
weather to the Getschnerscharte where the storm caught me, making for
a wet and uncomfortable steep descent to the Jamtalhütte. At least they
had a drying room!

## Day Seven

Up through the Futschöl Pass, down into the Urschai and thence to F-tan
and Scoul. Beautiful weather all day.

## Day Eight

From great lodging in Scoul, I hiked down the up to S-charl, having to
take a detour up to Avrona since the gorge was closed for construction
work (landslides the previous year). After dinner in S-charl I hiked
up above the trees on Mot Mezdi to get a nice look around.

## Day Ten

Steeply up through empty forest to Piz Chavalatsch, then down to the
Obere Stilfser Alm. Here, I departed from the official trail in order to
stay high and create an extra long day for the following day. The official
trail goes down to Stilfs.

## Day Eleven

Up to the Stilfserjoch in good weather, then through the Bocchetta di Forcula
into the wild Valle Forcula. Beautiful despite rain in the afternoon.
I stayed at the M. Scale Rifugio at Lago Cancano.

## Day Twelve

With approaching bad weather, I decided to call a stop here. Guido gave
me a ride to Bormio, then I came up with many buses and trains. Good times!
