### Kramerspitz
_Feb 15, 2009_

Attempt on Kramerspitz in incredibly deep snow. I only got a bit beyond the
little metal ramp that sticks out over a cliff, breaking trail in waist-deep
snow above the hut. I wanted to be home early. I was just trying things out
after a shoulder injury on my bike a few weeks before. It was nice to be able
to at least hike again!
