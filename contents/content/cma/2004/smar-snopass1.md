### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, March 7, 2004

I came back with Kris Sunday afternoon. Despite constant rain (yuck), we had
a good time. She improved her skiing technique dramatically, and learned to
go faster yet relax more. Finally we quit at 5 pm, totally soaked but pleased.
We stayed at Summit West.
