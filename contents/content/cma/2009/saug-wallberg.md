### Wallberg
_August 19, 2009_

I took a long lunch and went to the south side of the Tegernsee. Walking fast, I
made it to the summit of Wallberg (oddly I'd never been up there before) in 1
hour. Then I got lazy and took the lift down, but I should have run. Next time!
Excellent weather, it's been a really dry and nice August so far (surprising as
hell).
