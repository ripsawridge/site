### Hirschberg
<b>February 24, 2010</b>

A crack of dawn ski up Hirschberg. Very nice trip up, the Karwendel Mountains looked great off to the south. The ski down was very icy and not that fun until reaching the piste lower, which is generally better before the snow melted a bit. Oh well, price to pay for going up and back so early. 1:45 up, 900 meters. 30 minutes down. Gave a hitchhiker a ride on the way home, felt like a "good samaritan" :-).
