<h3>Lake Serene, 1/16/2003</h3>

Theron and I hiked up to the lake via the new trail very early in the morning.
It was a nice workout. We encountered snow on the traverse to the lake, and the
lake itself was semi-frozen. The Index Peaks were just amazing. We took the
old trail down, hoping to save some time in the long controlled fall down
mossy roots and rocks.
