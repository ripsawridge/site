### Index Climbing, 8/29/04}
Mardi had never climbed at Index, so Bob and I took her out there for
a fun climb of the Great Northern Slab route.  She did super well! Actually, it
seemed like Bob was more inclined to feel wierd about the exposure
while rappeling and stuff like that than she was :-). We did the usual
three pitches, climbing the bolted slab variation on the last
one. Then just for fun we climbed the 2nd pitch of Aries: the 5.8
stellar finger crack that leads to the chimney. On the way home Bob
said "so are you going to put this on your little web site?" He can
be such a mom sometimes!
