### Beez climbing
<i>September 28, 2011</i>

Yves and I got off work early to climb at the Liedekerke crag in the Beez climbing area. Belgium has surprisingly good climbing! Here is what we did:

<ul>
<li><b>La Gouden Carolus (4+)</b> - Yves led this as a warm up. Nice route, big holds, long too.</li>
<li><b>Les Huit Points Du 26 Mai (5b+)</b> - One fantastic 70 meter pitch, going up a face to crux moves, passed with a few nice hand jams in a crack. I rested just before the crux. I belayed at a tree on top of the crag, which was confusing because I'd been expecting to find an anchor. Yves came up and we laughed about the adventure. 2 rappels reached the ground.</li>
<li><b>La Liedekerke</b> - The real classic of this crag. The first pitch, rated 3+ in the book, was mostly avoided on the right by climbing on <b>Les Bronzes (4+)</b>, providing excellent climbing despite a fair amount of vegetation. Pitch two (<b>5a</b>) contained memorable crack climbing with (as one commenter put it nicely on <a href="https://www.belclimb.net/route_detail.asp?routeid=311">belclimb.net</a>) "alpine feeling." I belayed Yves up from the top of the crag, a great sunset view with tugboats plying the waterway. 2 rappels to the base.</li>
<li><b>Schils (5b+)</b> - A climb with hard moves at the start, an easier section, then crux moves in a gray crack shortly before the end. We just did the 35 meter first pitch, but apparently it's possible to continue to the top of the crag. Really enjoyable! I had trouble clipping the bolt during the crux so I actually fired through then clipped delicately at my feet afterwards. Then Yves and I both top-roped the route as it grew fully dark. Bats whirled around the crag.</li>
</ul>

Thanks Yves for a great time!
