I'm <b>hiking the Continental Divide Trail</b>, starting April 21st!
</p>

<p>
I'm already blogging about it at <a href="https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/">
Getting-Lost-On-The-CDT.blogspot.com</a>.
I'm traveling light, and traveling alone. My thought is, <i><b>if I deepen the wilderness outside of me,
then I may enter a vaster space inside</b></i>. As a kid, the deserts of New
Mexico were a magical place my mom and I drove through, stopping at ghost
towns. The main feeling was "wonderment." Wondering at the lives lived out
here...the arc of them, from bright promise to faded glory.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we spring up in a desert as well. Maybe we already see that our
reach exceeded our grasp. But there is beauty in acceptance. Look: the
desert flower perishes. <b>It is amazing, that it began at all.
In the heart of this mystery, <i>I will walk</i>.</b>
</p>

<i>(I know that sounds very "high and mighty,"
the truth is I'm <b>just a trail dog</b>, happy in the dirt!)</i> ðŸ˜„
