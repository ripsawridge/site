* North Ridge (5.6, 20+ pitches)
* August, 2002

The Sassolungo is the longest climb in our guidebook about the Italian
Dolomites.  It climbs 3000 feet directly from meadows to the
summit. The descent is long, complex and intimidating.  The weather
was intimidating too - threatening to storm and then following
through! The flying buttresses, vertical towers and deep chasms give
the peak a faery-tale look. Steve and I had seen it from the Sella
Pass a year before, and a great desire to climb it gripped me.


I hoped to climb the route with Mat Richter, 
our friend who lived in 
Garmisch, Germany. He is a really strong and experienced climber, and 
I looked forward to finally doing a climb with him. We worked it out 
that he would drive down either on our first or second Saturday in Italy. 
I had to keep an eye on the weather, and scout out the approach to save 
time on the morning of the climb.


Late Thursday afternoon, shortly after Kris, Christos and I arrived in 
Val Gardena, I hiked up the approach trail. It went through an amazing 
bouldering garden. I got my heart pumping by soloing a 40 foot high 
"5.5" line, then climbing back down. I knew that our success would 
depend on simulclimbing at least half of the route, and the tension 
I experienced on that little test-piece made me worry about the future. 
But perhaps the water is cold until you swim around a while!

I left the Klettergarten and hiked a road through meadows, tripping 
occasionally because I kept looking up at the mountain, wondering 
where our route went. It was kind of hard to tell from the single 
black and white picture in the guidebook. I left the road and crossed 
a steep meadow to a broad saddle below the North Ridge. It was getting 
dark, so I didn't go right up to the base, but was able to identify the 
start, which was kind of vague.


The three of us sat out in the moonlight that night, talking about 
things and looking at the huge bulk of the mountain. I had a very 
lonely feeling, thinking about what it would be like to climb it in 
just two days.


Friday was a nice day, and Kris and I spent the time climbing what might 
be the most beautiful via ferrata in the range, Tridentina. It was her 
first, and her joy made me very happy. As usual, the 3rd class scree 
descent was less pleasant, but it couldn't dampen her elation. 


Mat was going to drive down that night, and sleep at the Sella Pass. I 
managed to sleep pretty well despite my tension and curiosity. Would 
Mat be there? Would the weather hold?


*Maria had lived in the village her whole life, recently taking English 
lessons in Ortisei. She was skeptical of my idea to climb the wall outside 
our window, promising to say a prayer. Somehow this was feeling like the 
biggest climb I'd ever attempted, and I guess it was. I got that feeling 
that events were carrying me forward. Maybe that happens when you are going 
to do something that feels big, risky and unknown? Writing this now, 
months later, that mindset seems pretentious. Of course, the unknown 
is no longer there.*


I sped to the pass, mostly in second gear, the road to myself. How would 
I know Mat? I dimly remembered his car. I went back and forth between the 
Sellajochhaus and the pass, not finding him. As dawn gradually came into 
the sky my heart sank. Even if I find him now, it may be too late to start 
the attempt. I tried to think of consolation prizes that would make up for 
the let-down, finally deciding to climb the descent route alone. After an 
hour of searching for Mat I gave up, and got ready to hike up and do this. 
At that moment, Mat and Ari drove up! Such demanding changes between hope 
and consolation!
They had camped a little further down, and the alarm didn't go off. With 
childlike innocence, Ari had assumed she would hear me drive by. Meanwhile 
I had awakened two guys in bivy sacks further up the road, then shuffled 
away embarrassed.


Mat's relaxation had a calming effect on me, and I munched some of their 
food while he got ready. Soon we were hiking away, and Ari took off in the 
other direction to climb Piz Boe'. We joked on the hike up. I drilled Mat 
on his work on rheumatic diseases, and asserted I could do that stuff 
just as well. Perhaps I'd already applied for his job? That was for me to 
know and him to find out!


But soon his excellent physical conditioning made itself known as I talked 
less and breathed more, especially on the steep meadows, where I had to 
stop every few minutes on the blistering pace. We were encased in fog, 
and I thanked Mat for suggesting I make the approach beforehand, because 
I was able to navigate in the murk to a point where I knew the direction 
to turn to. After hiking some scree, a faint trail led to the wet and 
vague route start.


It looked hard enough that we put on rock shoes, made our packs ready, and 
roped up with 80 feet between us. At first there were muddy hummocks of 
soil mixed with the rock, and a steep chimney. I had to stop for a 
time-consuming pack rearrangement, as my ice axe was not secured well. 
But then I followed my nose
up easier rock on ledges, faces and chimneys, placing almost no protection. 
I didn't know how far I would get, but wanted to get hundreds of feet up. 
We were still surrounded by mist.


I belayed Mat up to a point where I wasn't sure of the way. His verdict 
that a yellow open book was too hard confirmed my hesitant thoughts, and 
I kept going with the gear he'd given me, traversing rightward, climbing 
in gullies or on the faces between them. I'd seen no sign of previous 
parties yet, and finally reached an identifiable feature of the route: a 
steep yellow wall characterized by a traverse along the base. I found two 
pitons here, clipped them, and realized I was out of gear. I belayed from 
a pin and a nut halfway across the traverse. While Mat came up, the clouds 
parted enough to reveal cows and green rocky meadow below. The sun was 
trying to burn through the top as well. Mat arrived, and we realized that 
in two "pitches," we'd climbed 900 feet! I felt really good about that, 
and knew the clouds were going to burn off. The dream was becoming reality!


As I belayed Mat out, a party of three soloing Italians suddenly
arrived.  They were talkative, but I couldn't be distracted from my
work. They asked the time. The rope came tight, and I followed with a
"Ciao."  At this point they roped up on a very short rope (10 feet
between them?), and climbed slowly enough that we never saw them
again.


Mat's traverse led into a bowl with a trickle of water and polished black 
slabs. We traversed under the worst of these (they appeared to overhang), 
and picked our way to the right of a waterfall. It got steeper, but the 
protection was scarce. Finally, there was a crux pitch where Mat had to 
delicately traverse a near-vertical wall for 30 feet, but was able to 
find good protection. After this, we scrambled to the base of a great 
central gully, and stopped for a drink.


There was one other party on the route that day, a group of four Italians 
who passed us, unroped, at this point. Do they ever rope up? I really 
wouldn't want to climb this without one, especially because the rock 
became very loose in the gully/chimney. In fact, this party knocked 
down volleys of stone which fell out into space over a vertical step. 
I didn't envy Mat climbing through that on lead! We waited a few more 
minutes, then Mat quickly climbed through the exposed area. 


He led on as walls closed in on either side. Vertical, somewhat loose 
steps mixed with dirt gullies characterized this segment. I knew that 
after this, we'd reach the Pitzl Notch, kind of a halfway point. The 
hardest climbing would be still be ahead, but we expected to find more 
fixed protection there. So far, we'd only seen the two pitons down at 
the yellow traverse.


We had some uncertainty at a branch in the gully, taking the right fork. 
The other one closed off in smooth walls and overhangs. I was greeted at 
the Pitzlscharte by a smiling Mat and a warm sun. At that moment, a 
whistle sounded from the rock quarry across the valley. It was lunchtime, 
12 noon!


For the first time I could see Selva Gardena, and our cozy lodging on the 
slope above town. Was Kris looking at me now? I saw beautiful meadows to 
the west - the Seiser Alm. We joked around, I forgot about what but it 
was funny. Something about involuntary urination?


With the harder climbing ahead, we decided to pitch things out for a 
while. I really enjoyed this first lead above the notch (with some early 
route-finding help from Mat). Face climbing on good rock led to a headwall 
and a spectacular (I mean very spectacular) traverse to the left protected 
by an occasional piton. The cows and meadows were 1500 feet below, directly 
beneath my
feet. Out loud I husked "Wow, man...jeezus pleazus!!"


*"Dang this is incredible..."*


I was having so much fun absorbing the pitch and the surroundings, that 
the volleys of rock being knocked down by the party above didn't register. 
I reached a two piton belay at the base of a chimney. I was able to clip 
one of them, but had to girth hitch the head of the other, as it was kind 
of mangled and wouldn't fit a carabiner.
I leaned back, looking at the lazy cows between my feet and belayed Mat. 
I wondered about the occasional shouts from above. I wasn't too worried 
because thus far the rock had fallen down a parallel chimney to the right. 
Mat arrived and we knew we were having fun. "Right on, man."


I led the next pitch as well, a 50 meter 5.6 chimney. Mat took a
picture of me on this, which does a pretty good job of describing the
steepness and lack of protection. In fact, this pitch was basically a
solo, because the first piece of protection was a piton at 30
meters. The last 10 feet to reach it were very delicate, and I almost
held my breath on the way.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered it
was loose! I clipped it anyway, looking around for a cam or nut
placement.  The wiggling pin would have to do, but I had no
illusions. Shortly after, the climbing eased to a 4th class gully. I
tried to avoid touching the loose rocks and dirt in the center. When I
did touch it with my right foot, all hell broke loose! An explosion of
rocks and dirt seemed to leap out of the gully and disappear over a
cliff - right towards Mat! *"ROCK! ROCK! ROCK!"* I was very
relieved when he called up that he was OK. He came up and I heard his
story.


He was greatly assisted by the configuration at the belay. Remember that 
there were two pitons at the edge of the chimney, the inside one was 
girth-hitched. Mat was able to lift the sling off of this piton and 
swing out of the chimney onto the great yellow wall. He only had one 
direct hit to the helmet, then swung out of the line of fire. 


Despite his own excessive care climbing the treacherous gully, a misplaced 
foot let loose another cannon of stonefall. The next pitch would be similar, 
and I belayed while Mat climbed, looking up furtively for problems. In fact, 
this pitch was better, and I enjoyed following in the snug stemming chimney. 
I climbed an easier pitch, then Mat headed up an indistinct area for two 
pitches. I led a pitch up a random chimney which led to the ridge crest. 
We simul-climbed for a while then stopped for a drink. You know, I was 
tired at this point! We continued, simulclimbing up and down two towers, 
finally down to the base of a bowl with patches of snow and dirt. 500 
feet of class 3 and 4 led to the summit ridge. I was feeling the altitude 
and did my best to keep up with Mat. On the ridge, we had a 5 minute walk 
to the summit.


It was amazing to be there. Somehow, there was a wooden bench! We signed 
the logbook, took some pictures and reveled in the glory of landscape at 
our feet. We'd climbed well together and had a great time. Now of course, 
thoughts of the descend prevent total relaxation. The weather seemed to be 
failing as clouds swirled in.



Mat did a spectacular job finding the route up and down along a ridge and 
towers to an obvious rappel station. We made two 30 meter rappels as the 
rain started, passing the green emergency bivouac shelter that had provided 
me with some mental comfort on the climb. As the rain turned to hail, we 
began downclimbing loose, slabby third class terrain to a notch with a 
tower. We continued down the gully which began running with ice water. 
I was a bit alarmed by the speed of the weather change. Suddenly all the 
places I wanted to put my hands for holds were covered in round, white 
chunks of ice. We came to a convenient notch on the side of the gully 
with an overhang and a choice of left or right. We waited a few minutes 
in the worst of the hail and consulted the guidebook, finally deciding 
to stay in the main gully. I foolishly put on thin gloves which made the 
next pitch very difficult. The gloves served to keep the icy water next 
to my hands, which quickly went numb. Mat reached flat terrain at the 
base of the gully, but I had difficulty joining him until I'd warmed my 
hands somewhat. I remember a pretty sketchy move between two waterfalls 
with nothing for my feet - so I had to be able to feel how hard my hands 
were gripping! Once past this, I gratefully reached Mat.


Now we traversed to a snow and ice gully, and began making rappels. I had 
an ice axe, and was able to descent a portion of the gully without 
rappelling by sticking to the moat on the side, but Mat was (characteristically) 
clad in tennis shoes. We were able to link anchors on the sides of the 
gully to the bottom where we met a party. They had attempted to reach 
the summit by this route, but were stopped by the weather at the top 
of the ice gully.


I remember getting some water here, feeling warmer and better. The hail 
and numb hands had scared me a little bit. It was great to have Mat 
along for his confidence while I was thinking of climbing back to the 
Bivouac box! Now we descended a trail into a great bowl and a receding 
glacier. The ease of the terrain made me guess that we were almost done. 
But we had to make a rising traverse on a gradually disappearing path, 
climbing up and down through notches. The terrain got steeper, and 
finally I could see the Toni Demetz Hut a long ways away. We had to 
get there almost entirely by traversing a wet cliffside! Boy, this descent 
went on and on and on.


At one point there were some iron cables which prevented a need to get 
out the rope and belay. Sometimes we'd find a rappel station and use it, 
or downclimb, always traversing and going down. It was a pretty fantastic 
ledge system - I always expected a dead end, but a look around the corner 
would reveal something just doable without a rope. 
After two vertical rappels the terrain got easier, and I lagged behind 
as Mat got off the rock onto the scree leading up to the hut. There was 
a final bouldering problem with a waterfall which I climbed mechanically - 
too exhausted to feel anything!


The 500 feet up to the hut was really tough, and I got there to meet Mat 
ready to ski down the scree to the car. I just had to go in and warm up 
for a second though! Perhaps Mat didn't want to taint the climb with 
civilization, because he stayed outside in the rain. 5 minutes later, 
I felt better and we began hiking down, eventually switching to lovely 
scree-skiing. It was starting to get dark, and when we got near the 
Sellajochhaus, Mat spied a figure approaching. It was Ari! And she was 
excited about the hike she'd done. I think she saw an ibex. The three 
of us walked happily to the car. I was gushing about the climb, kind 
of amazed that it was a day trip!


I loved this climb, I learned a lot. Maybe nothing specific, but the 
idea of what is possible for me was expanded. Climbing with Mat was 
a priceless experience. He's truly a "man of the mountains," moving 
swiftly and with confidence. I believe that his calm demeanor in
the face of uncertainty will always be a top asset to any party he 
is with in the mountains. I hope we can climb again sometime! [An 
update on Mat, he and Jeff went on a whirlwind climbing trip a 
month ago, climbing The Nose on El Cap, Lost Arrow Spire, several 
other valley routes, and finishing up with a very late season ascent 
of the North Ridge of Mt. Stuart here in Washington. The pictures 
from that climb
were beautiful, and the thought that I was in my office at work 
during that experience nearly did me in].


Back in town we found Kris and Christos on the street, and repaired 
to an "Irish Pub" for some beer. Mat and Ari drove home. He had to 
get up early the next day for a triathalon. Kind of puts things in 
perspective!


Anyway, I thought this was an excellent climb, and would highly 
recommend it to anyone comfortable simul-climbing 5th class terrain
 with sparse pro. There is no way you could belay every pitch. It 
also isn't necessary to solo the route (unless you want to). We were 
roped up the whole way up, and not at all on the way down.
We took from dawn to dusk on this late August day.
