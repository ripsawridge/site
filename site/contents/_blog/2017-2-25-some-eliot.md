Tonight I watched [All is lost](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_is_lost_2013/).
I enjoyed this movie when it came out. I felt compelled to see it
again.

I was reading about the movie, and Robert Redford quoted T.S.Eliot when asked
about it. "There is only the trying. The rest is not our business."
I wanted to read more of this.

Here is a large excerpt from Four Quartets that speak to me, including that line:

_East Coker, section V, from "Four Quartets"_

> So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years—  
> Twenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres  
> Trying to use words, and every attempt  
> Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure  
> Because one has only learnt to get the better of words  
> For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which  
> One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture  
> Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate  
> With shabby equipment always deteriorating  
> In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,  
> Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer  
> By strength and submission, has already been discovered  
> Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope  
> To emulate—but there is no competition—  
> There is only the fight to recover what has been lost  
> And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions  
> That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.  
> For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.  
>   
> Home is where one starts from. As we grow older  
> The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated  
> Of dead and living. Not the intense moment  
> Isolated, with no before and after,  
> But a lifetime burning in every moment  
> And not the lifetime of one man only  
> But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.  
> There is a time for the evening under starlight,  
> A time for the evening under lamplight  
> (The evening with the photograph album).  
> Love is most nearly itself  
> When here and now cease to matter.  
> Old men ought to be explorers  
> Here or there does not matter  
> We must be still and still moving  
> Into another intensity  
> For a further union, a deeper communion  
> Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,  
> The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters  
> Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.
