NOW are we there?

Barbara, Chris and I climbed the Anfaenger Freude route (5+) that we'd done 2
years before, this time with Chris. Barbara was crabby, but Chris was
super-chill. My lady had not slept well, and found the long hike and especially
the steep and loose approach to the climb unpleasant. But! She did great on the
initial grade 5 slab, and saw that the climbing at Bad Heilbrunn the week
before had helped her prepare for such terrain.

Higher on the route, she was disappointed that she had to pull on the sling at
the grade 5+ crux. I didn't know that, but when she told me of her
disappointment later I had a pang of sympathy. Poor darling! I definitely know
that feeling...

Making things worse, I didn't like the look of the clouds, thinking it was
going to storm, so I made us walk down in our rock shoes instead of abseiling.
The route is not set up for abseiling either, there are no rap rings at the
anchors, and you'd have to leave gear. My bad for poor judgment! I also thought
the climbing would be more fun if we didn't have to bring our packs.

So, we picked our way slowly down with sore feet. Chris and I hiked up to the
base to get the packs, then in light on and off rain we continued down. We were
really thirsty, and found water in the forest that was so delicious, we all
remarked on it days later.

The next day I went back alone to do the Klettersteig on the Berchtesgadener
Hochthron.  A sign warned of trouble with the moat between snow and rock at the
start of the climb, but it wasn't a problem. This was a lot of fun! I hung out
for an hour on my own grassy knoll near the summit.
