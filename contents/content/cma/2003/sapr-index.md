<h3>Index Climbing, April 4, 2003</h3>

Still eager for Princely Ambitions I was back, this time with Chris
Koziarz. We arrived in early evening, somewhat delayed by a serious
car accident on highway 2. What do you think the weather was like?
It was raining, of course. We hiked up to the base of Roger's Corner (5.9)
to check it out. Though it is reputed to be dry on wet days, the start was
wet enough to turn us away. Instead, I led the short 5.8 fist crack,
and continued up to the railroad bolts (I think the fist crack is called
the Lizard first pitch?). Chris came up and climbed the Twin Cracks.
Then we top roped Libra Crack/Pisces, and rappelled down to the bolts.
Naturally, the rope got stuck in the dark, and I climbed up to retrieve
it. Oh well, the next morning we set out for Dragontail Peak!
