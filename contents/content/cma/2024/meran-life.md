## Day 1 - Bozen

I drove down in the morning and hiked up to Oberbozen.
Later, I camped near Meran.

## Day 2 - Meran

I hiked up from town to the Mutspitze. I used the lift down
to Dorf Tyrol, then walked back to the car.

Great day...

## Day 3 - Hönigspitz

I decided to take it easy, so I took my boots, crampons and
ice axe up on the Hirzer lift and went up the Hönigspitz.

*Looking down to the right on the Hönigspitz climb*

I made an error and was tempted to climb snow and rock slopes
to a false summit with a cross on it. Turned out I still had
a long ways to go to the true summit. Getting down from this
summit was rather slow -- much easier to climb up than down!
Lots of ice axe in mud, one hand on rock kind of thing...

*That apparent summit is a false summit, complete with cross!*

*Looking across to Hirzer from the summit*

I thought about continuing, but it looked incredibly steep to get
down the saddle near Hirzer from here, so I decided to play it safe.

I slept in Mantra after a great pizza dinner.

## Day 4 - the Matatzspitz

Just a great hike up a glorious ridge.

I bought cheese and bread from a great little hut by the Waalweg.
They close on November 1st, I'll have to remember that.

Wet snow that burst into water droplets near the summit!
