Barbara and I set out on snowshoes just above the parking lot. It was a first for her,
and that was fun. She started laughing like crazy once the snowshoes were in
"high-heels" mode on a slope. Really fun...I'm so used to them, they don't feel odd
anymore!

It was about 1200 meters up and down. The final slope was quite steep and I felt
we should probably have ice axes. But with a bit of caution going down (strong
plunge stepping), we were soon off the exposed slopes
