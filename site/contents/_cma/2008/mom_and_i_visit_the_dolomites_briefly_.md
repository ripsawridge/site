On the way home from Florence, the weather was too good to miss a driving
trip to the Dolomites. Just north of Bolzano we turned east and rapidly
climbed up into the mountains. We were hungry for quite a while, but also
in a hurry to make it to the Pordoi Pass in order to take a lift up to
the Pordoi Spitze. This peak has an amazing 360 degree view of surrounding
mountains. Finally we found a little fast food stand (there are surprisingly
few of these, in fact the area seemed kind of deserted), and got a hamburger
and a Panini sandwich.
  
  
After a drive through a pretty valley we started the first of 35 180 degree
switchbacks that would get us up to the pass. Mom did really well...I've
made people sick with my driving on these things! But I'm a very mild driver
compared to the Italians, and especially to the motorcycles, trust me!
  
  
We got to the pass and it was freezing cold. We grabbed what jackets we
could find and bought our tickets. The lift took us up several thousand
feet in just 5 minutes. I was really happy to be able to show Mom the area.
The Dolomites are really my favorite place in the Alps. The relief between
summit and valley is very great, and very steep too. There is only one
glacier in the whole range, but the many sheer cliffs make up for that.
And the meadows are so peaceful and friendly, making a great contrast with
the spiky peaks.
  
  
Later we sat in a meadow below the Sella Pass. We had the massive Langkofel
peaks on our left, and Piz Boe with it's dozen or so subsidiary peaks on
the right. Here are some pictures:
