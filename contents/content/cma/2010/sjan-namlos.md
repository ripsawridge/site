### Namloser Wetterspitze
<b>January 23, 2010</b>

With good avalanche conditions, it seemed like a fine time to ski the
Wetterspitze. My shins were very sore, especially on the left leg...only later
I realized that the boots were locked into downhill mode (I thought I checked
that!). From the col, the final climb to the summit was steep and icy. The
views were amazing, and the ski down was really fun. Total elevation gain: 1400
meters.
