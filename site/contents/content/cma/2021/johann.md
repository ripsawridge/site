The day after the [Schladminger High Route](schladming.html), I had just
enough energy to consider a climb of the Dachstein. As it turned out, it was
enough for me to do the Johann Klettersteig and call it a day.

I hiked up from the parking lot of the Dachstein Südwandbahn, reaching
the Dachsteinsüdwandhütte after 30 minutes or so. On the other side
of the hut I got a bit confused, and almost descended too low, but finally
found a faint trail crossing the scree basin to reach an upper basin
below the iron-cable route. Purists will first climb the "Anna" Klettersteig
on a buttress below this approach. I was too tired for that!

I was happy that the route wasn't crowded. There were a few people above me,
and I chatted with one man who arrived just as I did, having come by the
Anna approach.

The route starts with an intimidating overhang. However, it is soon
overcome. If you've got some rock climbing experience, this is not a very
big deal. However, having done little climbing in the year since my injury,
I did find the overall route quite tiring! The sustained vertical
wall of the ["Adlerhorst"](https://www.bergsteigen.com/fileadmin/userdaten/import/topos/der_johann_klettersteig_dachstein_topo.jpg) was really something.

When I reached the *Dachsteinwarte*, a little hut on the glacier above, I
was quite tired and went in to enjoy some food and drink. The summit klettersteig
appeared quite busy, and there was a line of people waiting to begin.
That was enough of a signal for me to feel good about leaving the summit
for another day. The weather was perfect however, one couldn't ask for better!

I chatted with the fellow above me on the route, his name is also Michael.
He said the Klettersteig which descends from the mountain station of the
Südwandbahn is quite nice for the return trip. I decided to walk over and
do that. He and I found ourselves together again at the top of the Klettersteig,
waiting for a Hungarian film crew shooting a dramatic scene right below
the exit of the route. We exchanged a few words and jokes with the mountain
guide accompianying the filming crew, then with the director as we slid
down the ropes. On the way down we talked about all kinds of things,
from politics to daily life. Thanks Michael for a fun conversation! The
way down felt easy, quick and fun with your company.

I'll be back to finish this peak, too!

*p.s. - Michael found out that the movie should be about [Zsolt Erőss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsolt_Er%C5%91ss),
a great Hungarian climber who died in a tragic accident in 2013 on Kangchenjunga. The movie should show up on Netflix at some point.*
