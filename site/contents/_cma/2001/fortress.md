A handful of pictures from a really long day trip.  Chris, Jake and I climbed
well over 8000 feet in a day, driven forward by the amazing scenery in this
forgotten area of the Cascades.

_A bunch of these pictures were lost over the years..._

up the glacier and into the rock band on the skyline. Let's go!](images/articles/trips/2001/buckmtn.jpg)
