### Franklin Falls ice climbing, Jan 5, 2004
Dan Smith and I got a late start from town and began hiking up the
snow-covered road to Franklin Falls near Snoqaulmie Pass. It was a 
pleasant 2.5 mile hike, first on road then trail, mostly level.
We reached the falls which had a lot of water coming down, but
there were some great curtains of ice mostly to the left. We
saw a variety of ideas, imagining setting up top ropes after a lead.

It looked easy enough for me to lead, so Dan belayed me up some ice 
steps. Solid ice screws provided protection low on the route.

There was running water behind the curtain of ice I climbed, and
sometimes I would break through the ice and see water spraying
inches from my face! About 50 feet up, the ice ran out, and there
were some scary moves on dripping rock under snow. I was able to
place a sawed-off knifeblade piton here. Traversing left, I reached
an ice pillar and placed a screw. I decided against climbing it, as
the top out looked like evil vertical brush under a thin layer of
snow. Also, the ice was brittle. Later I realized I had dulled my
tools by hitting rock under thin ice, so it wasn't necessarily
that brittle, but dull tools cause it to fracture. So I traversed
left, then went up an interesting ramp of ice mushrooms. 
Near
the top of the ramp, I hurried to avoid spray from a secondary
waterfall. I reached an alcove, and after some experimentation,
made a belay by slinging a large ice pillar. We had imagined
climbing this pillar to trees 20 feet above, but the pillar terminated
in a ceiling and would provide some overhanging climbing we didn't
feel like doing! Funny how much easier it looked from below...

Dan came up. He enjoyed the climb quite a bit. It was almost a full
rope length, with decent protection and varied terrain. In honor of
an event Dan and I shared the day before, I'd call the route 
"Bald Tires" - WI3. Bring stubbies and pitons.

We rapped off the pillar

with a piton backup, a 60 meter rope was required to touch down.

We bouldered around for a while, then headed home. Many hikers
were coming in, and we had been an object of attention for various
parties of two and three. "Are the ice climbers still there?"
queried one breathless young woman as we hiked out. Good times!
