Barbara and I climbed the Seebergspitze from Pertisau by the South(east) Ridge.
We intended to traverse to the Seekarspitze but thunder and an approaching storm sent
us fleeing into the *Pfanne* once having descended the steep and rather interesting
North Ridge. We followed the road north around to the Seekaralm (1500 m), then down
to the water south of Achenkirch. From here I took the ferry back to the car, and
came to pick up Barbara and Mara. Boy, was she mad that she didn't get to ride the
ferry! The problem was that Mara needed to wear a muzzle on the boat and we didn't
have one.

1200 meters up and down.
