I hiked from a little museum building a bit above the town of Sankt Leonhard
towards the pass. A nice man let me park, essentially, in his yard where
he was doing carpentry. He was there when I got back too, and also let me
have water from his spring. Really nice, because I was dying of thirst.

Snow stopped me about 150 meters below the pass. It was knee deep soft
stuff. Reminded me of the San Juans last year. Quite interesting, the near-vertical
town of Glaiten, whose yards I huffed and puffed through between clearings in
the forest. The high meadows were gorgeous. I love the brown grass of
this Texel-adjacent region. 1534 meters up/down.
