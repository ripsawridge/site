Kris encouraged me to make this blog for a few reasons. For one thing,
she's had a lot of fun with her "Trip Reports of the Mundane" blog, and
we've both enjoyed going back and reading about some crazy thing that happened
a few months ago that we would otherwise forget. For another, I've got
a mountaineering web site that has been a huge source of fun and memories,
but I can't easily notate the everyday joys and irritations of life there.
That site pre-dates blogging, and really wants to stay a dry list of mountain
trips. Thirdly, like any fine young lady, Kris likes when I write something
about her, and as my climbs became snowier and steeper, she found less
interesting stuff about herself to read. In fact, I have to laugh a little
bit about my trip reports which have gotten a little mechanical. Maybe
it's the essentially repetitive nature of the mountaineering story showing
through? But I was going to try not to wax on about climbing over here,
at least not yet, so on to other things :-).

Alas! the television is competing for my meager attention. For some reason
I'm really finding the line "When you were UNEMPLOYED...in GREENLAND!"
hilarious. It would be sad to be unemployed in 18th century Greenland wouldn't
it?
  
  
I did learn some trivia last night. Did you know that native Hawaiians
were great fur trappers in the 18th and 19th centuries? They came to the
American West and worked beaver traps as far east as the Rocky Mountains.
In fact, the Owyhee River in dry southeastern Oregon is named for 3 Hawaiians
working on that river who were surprised and killed by indians. "Owyhee"
was Captain Cook's original spelling of Hawaii. Long-distance travel unaided
by machines is really interesting to me.
  
  
On that odd note, goodbye!
