The Tooth (Peter's Birthday)
--------

Jeff Witt was in town, and Peter set up a chance for us to go climbing
together. The total group was Jeff, Peter, Kim, Jake, Larry and myself. We
parked at the upper lot and headed up the snowy path under blue sky.  Jeff had
been offered a guiding position for Exum Mountaineering. He'll spend the summer
guiding clients on the Grand Teton and other Wyoming peaks. He'd paid his dues,
and we were all happy to see his dream come true! He told us about various
climbing trips on the way up.

We climbed steeply to Pineapple Pass, not realizing that we'd missed
the easier approach up one gully to the south until I'd topped out and
discovered rappel slings. This was actually an enjoyable way to get to
the base of the climb, but some in our party didn't have ice axes, and
that made the way feel less secure. It was quick though.


Jake and I started out first. I wore plastic boots because my light
hikers needed resoling, and one of my leather boots was broken and in
the shop. We used a doubled 8 mm rope, so had to climb 25 meter
pitches. I set off, enjoying the dry rock and sun.  Jake came up and
we set off again. He and Angie just had a wonderful baby girl, and
he's been away from the mountains for awhile. The Tooth was a great
reintroduction. Amazingly, we had it to ourselves until we reached the
summit. Peter and Kim climbed on a rope, Jake and Larry just behind.


I was finding the climb more difficult in plastics, especially slabby
sections where my feet dangled uselessly. I wore a pack, and as for
the contents, I kept them secret. On the last pitch I angled left to
the "catwalk," but needed to use the catwalk for my hands because I
didn't trust the boots without good handholds. For me, this pitch was
about 5.8, with a real dearth of protection until I reached the crack
that angles back right. I was sweating pretty nicely and wishing for a
top rope for a while there! At one point, one of the tiny edges I
placed my boot on exploded under the pressure. Happily, I had good
handholds.  I really wished for leather boots, or maybe crampons, or
maybe just in socks or barefoot.


I belayed Jake up, and settled in to enjoy the view and unveil my
surprise. You see, it was also Peter's birthday, and Kris had baked
cupcakes the night before. I had a package with eight cupcakes,
frosting, sprinkles and two candles! Jake, Jeff and Larry helped me
build the cupcakes, and Jeff lit the candle. Peter and Kim appeared
and we sang happy birthday. There is a picture of Peter blowing out
the candle, but actually the wind beat him to it.


So we enjoyed a great dessert on top of a fun little peak, admiring
the views of nearby peaks. Even Mt. Rainier was out in full
splendor. We were so pleased to be out!


I was admiring the traverse over to 
Denny Peak and trying to entice
some companions.  I'd gotten a ride with Jake, so when no one wanted
to go I was a little disappointed, but still happy with the day. It
was only 11 am and we began our descent. Peter and I made the final
rappels, collecting ropes as we went. I down-climbed the way we came
up, and Peter, Larry and Kim decided to rappel. Jake and Jeff hiked
around and down the easier way, and were later seen sunning themselves
on a rock in Great Scott Bowl.


As I started down, 
Dan Smith hiked up and we had a happy
meeting. "What a coincidence that you are here!" Dan had called my
house in the morning asking about going cragging at Index. Since he
couldn't reach me, he decided to climb the Tooth instead. I crafted a
happy solution, whereby I'd wait for Dan here, then we'd traverse to
Denny Peak. Dan could give me a ride back to the city, and my Tooth
companions could head home to a late lunch. I waved goodbye to the
great group of friends, now bounding down towards Source Lake.


Hiking up to a saddle I got a nice view of the Tooth and the people
now crawling all over it like ants. I watched Dan quickly climb and
down-climb the route. He came down Pineapple Pass, and slipped slightly
on the traverse over. I belted out a Simpson's-style "Ha ha!" 23 heads
turned to look!


"Hail fellow, well met!" Again we marveled at our good fortune to
meet. We traversed snow to meet the ridge to Denny Peak just before a
sharp, craggy crest. I pitifully squeaked an exemption to all rock
leading due to my boots. I didn't have a rope anymore, but I had a few
slings and pieces of protection. Dan had a static 7 mm line.  "Dynamic
hip belays only." I remembered the scars Mike Lubrecht had showed me
one day from his dynamic hip belay of a falling leader. "Okay." Gulp.


The first pitch had a tough move at the start. Dan scrabbled around,
caught himself when a handhold broke, and finally resorted to putting
on rock shoes. This helped, and soon he passed the hard section and
reached a belay on the ridge crest. I grunted up, and Dan took off for
a really fun pitch, climbing on and just below the crest on the right
side of the ridge. The exposure and unexpectedly good, solid climbing
had us shouting and belting out snippets of various songs.


We continued for another rock pitch then entered an easier section of
snow and shrubby ledges. We climbed to a false summit and saw that
Denny Peak was still a good distance away. 

"Should we bail here?"

"NAW!" 

For the next section I remember going up, down, and traversing
steeper snow. There were moats and cornices for excitement, but mostly
easy terrain. Near the summit of Denny Peak, we found many fuses from
explosives.  We also saw a hangman's noose tied around a tree. Wha? We
were also surprised to see some other people who came up from
Alpental. At the summit we realized we are now eligible for the
Mountaineer's Seven Snoqualmie Summits Pin. That is, if we were
members. Lessee, I've now got Chair, Snoqualmie, Lundin, Red,
Thompson, Tooth, and Denny! High five!


We quickly got down to the Alpental parking lot with a mixture of
glissading and running down the snowfields. Dan gave me a ride all the
way home to Woodinville (hella nice of him, because it's a long ways).


Thanks to Dan, Peter, Jeff, Kim, Jake and Larry for an excellent day
in the mountains!
