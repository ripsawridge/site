Kris, the boys and I planned a multi-day hike. The weather wasn't amazing, but
we brought umbrellas and resolved to make the best of it. I found a four or five
day hike in the Pfunderer Berge, which is the southern side of the Zillertal
Range. This is in Italy, sometimes hard against the Austrian border. We drove
through rainy mountains, went shopping for snacks at the last decent sized town
which was called Mühlen in Taufers, then made the short drive from there to
Lappach. I was worried about parking, but we managed okay. The town was building
a new tunnel which appeared to be very oversized next to the small array of
houses and churches. It rained lightly.

We had a lot of ground to cover, and headed up a very steep trail behind the
town to a narrow grassy pass 1000 meters above the town called the
Lappacherjöchl. Along the way, a month got on Elijah's hat, and he rode all the
way from deep forest to high meadows above timberline.

We ate some wild strawberries, and I even nibbled on a fine looking mushroom
growing nearby. No ill effects to report!

The boys did a great job on this sometimes punishing section in the forest, and
they loved playing in the boulders by a little house at mid-height, just before
walking a road for a little while to grassy country below the pass.

At the pass we were happy to have finished the elevation gain for the day. Now,
we just had a long and beautiful traverse northwards to the Chemnitzerhütte, our
home for the night. We passed a couple of beautiful lakes, and eventually the
boys went off in front, we told them to hold dinner for us at the hut, as it was
getting late!

The final slopes to the hut had some boulder scrambling and snowfields to
cross. Folks were really nice at the hut, and after a great dinner, Elijah,
Rowan and I went out to play in the boulders. Elijah especially enjoyed trying
to do the hardest climbs.

The weather was great the next morning, and we set off across alpine country
making for the southern glacial slopes below the Großer Möseler, one of the
higher peaks of the region. Soon, the view before us was filled with snow and
ice, but sun and babbling brooks made our immediate environment really lovely.

I had a strange accident, where I stepped on a rock on the side of the trail
that was kind of a "trap door." Before I knew what was happening, I was hurtling
straight down in rocks and brush on the side of the trail! Luckily, I stopped
after about 10 feet. Wow...that got the blood running! I recalled that only once
before had I had any similar accident...it was in 2001 on an ill-fated attempt
to climb Mount Challenger, when I slipped on wet heather and took a ride
straight down the hill for about 15 feet. Crazy stuff!

Anyway, on this day we walked seemingly forever, but we took a lot of nice rests
too. We ate snacks, napped, looked down at the beautiful lake below us (the
Neves Stausee). We had to travel a bit downhill and then back up again in the
last hour before reaching the Edelrauthhütte, but this was no problem.

At the hut, we settled in for dinner, noticing that it started to rain
outside. We planned to head south for another day, but a look at the map
revealed that it would be an exceptionally long day to reach the next hut. We
decided to go down to Lappach instead, especially since the weather forecast for
the next days was poor. The boys made a friend, gathering with him around a game
of Minecraft.

So we hiked down and east to the Neves Stausee in the morning. The boys helped
herd some errant goats south along the lake to join their friends. The dam at
the end of the lake was quite impressive, then a last steep trail led down into
the valley underneath the dam. We talked about what to do if the dam broke!

We came down to Oberlappach on the road, and 20 minutes later we were back at
the car. We got some gelato and a drink, then as if on cue, the thunderclouds
burst open right after we got in the car. We had outrageous rainstorms all the
way back over the pass.

On the way home, we stopped to ride a summer mountain rollar coaster and do a
ropes course at Oberaudorf, making for a very full day!

This was good fun. I love hiking with Kris and the boys so much.
