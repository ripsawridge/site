Hexenstein South Ridge (IV+)
Punta Fiames "Spigolo Jori" (V)
May 31 - June 1, 2008


Dan and I had been hoping to hook up for a rock climbing trip for a long
time. The weather was continually bad on weekends. Finally, we decided to
go and steeled ourselves to climb in the rain. It would be good training
after all, right?

The forecast for the Dolomites was "okay," though Sunday was better
than Saturday. We drove down Friday night and slept near the Tutti
Institute, a kind of hospital I guess. We decided to climb
the Punta Fiames via the famous Spigolo Jori (Jori Ridge). At grade V,
and 15 pitches, it seemed like a good early season challenge. Dan had
some warm coffee in a thermos, and as we drank a woman in a wheelchair
came out on a balcony and watched us.

We hiked up through soaking grass, happy at least that it wasn't
raining. Before long we found an obvious rocky gully that we thought
must be the way. After some spicy moves near it's head, we emerged in
little *latschen* trees, then came to the only obvious looking
starting point: a narrow ledge below an easy-looking black slab. We
roped up and sent me off for the first lead. It didn't seem to match
the route description, but we thought we must find the belay bolts up
there somewhere. It's just wet, so we thought the extra caution of
roping up a pitch below the true start was the right thing to do.

(If you sense trouble you are right!)

I girth-hitched a sling around a chockstone and started up a slab,
probably 5.5 or so. Happy to be done with that, I crabbed leftwards
again to eventually reach a corner where we thought belay bolts should
be. "I don't see anything!" I called out. Now it started to rain. I
tried to climb a little higher. Then, at a delicate move a foothold
broke or my foot slipped, I'm not sure which. I had a tense moment
there where I could easily have fallen. Realizing my protection was
laughably far away, I simply *had* to stay attached. After a
fraught minute, I was secure enough to downclimb. I'd made two cuts on
my left hand as I caught myself.

Still unwilling to give up the day (despite the rain...desperation
really screws with your head!), I found a lower ledge system and
traversed into the corner at a lower point I couldn't see from
above. In there was a deaths-head of stacked, teetering blocks. I
pushed one down (Dan was belaying safely far to the left) and
surrounded by the rich smell of cordite, I attempted a finger traverse
above and past the other loose blocks to what I hoped might be a belay
around the corner.

But it was foolish as hell. All at once I gave up. "I'm coming back
immediately, this is unjustified," I said, having made up my
mind. That took significant time, now that the rock was soaking with
rain. Eventually Dan could lower me from the fixed piton.

I felt bad, like I was making a bad "first impression" for climbing
with Dan, because the slab was tougher than it looked. Knowing
that the book calls this easy ground, I wondered why I found it so
difficult. I never suspected the truth: that we were not only on the
wrong route, but on the wrong mountain!

We hiked down. Dan was freezing and needed to warm up. Our thought was
that we could eat some lunch at the car, then climb something with a
very short approach at the Falzarego Pass. Once at the car we got a
surprise. "Oh my god...we weren't on Punta Fiames...look!" And so we
realized that we took a parallel and wrong gully, ending up on Punta
Croce. We mistook the deep gully on it's right for the deep gully on
the right of Punta Fiames. The sun came out and we could clearly see
the weeping black slab where I'd desperately tried to reach "the
first belay." Feeling like I deserved a Darwin Award, but at the same
time relieved to have an answer to the perplexing situation, I could
only shake my head at my foolishness.

Here's what I love about Dan. By the time we got to the Falzarego
Pass, it was raining again. Harder than ever. But I wanted to
climb. And he wanted to climb.

"We're gonna climb," he said, zipping up his rain
jacket. "Yeah!" I was right there with him. We moderated our plan to
climb the 6-8 pitch Hexenstein which went at an easy IV+ that we
thought we could manage when soaked. Still, grimly kicking steps up
slippery snow to the start of the route, water pooling in the creases
of my jacket, I was apprehensive yet curious. What could we achieve?

Dan took the first pitch, up a straightforward gully that led onto a
ridge with a bolt. As I followed the rain finally let up. We continued
like this for several pitches, sometimes in cloud, sometimes with
local views of the soaking black road and buildings of the
pass. Movement kept us warm, and we began to feel glad about our
choice to go out.

"I mean, I hear it rains all the time in Wales. They *must* just
go out in the rain. I'm happy to see that we can still do some
climbing anyway."

"Colin Haley goes out in the stormiest weather at night to
climb. If he can do that, then we should be able to stand a
rainstorm."

With comments in that vain, we made it to two pitches from the top. We
had some trouble after Dan used the full 70 meter rope on the next
pitch. I had to downclimb a bit from the belay, but the rope was tight
and I couldn't. Without some slack I faced an awkward fall into a
crevasse of jumbled rocks should I fail on a friction traverse. And it
was raining again, so I had no friction. I yelled my head off asking
for slack, but 70 meters of rope was an almost hopeless distance to
traverse by shouting. Finally he figured something was up and gave me
some rope. I was just about to untie and solo! 

This was a hard pitch, and a great lead by Dan. There was a dripping,
sopping overhanging chimney to climb, and he must have had nerves of
iron. "Good lead!" I said, before complaining a bit about the rope
being too long. He was at the top, having stepped around the crux IV+
crack. Again, what an incredible partner, he was willing to go along
with my idea to rappel and lead that pitch. "Sure!"

I owe him one or two beers for that. Man, it was pretty tough. Without
friction, it felt more like a VI- crack (that would be 5.9 or so)
instead of IV+. A few good hand and foot jams saw me through some
difficult parts. At the top I was completely tired and satisfied with
the day. Dan came up and enjoyed it too. 

Some blue sky came out to play, and we saw Tofana des Rozes emerge
from a cloud with an ample dusting of white on the upper screes. I
thought about the ominous vertical wall dropping to the south and
remembered.

We had a good time walking down a via ferrata and trail, back to the
road and the car. In Cortina we ate at the Cinque Torri Cafe, trying
to dry our things around us. It was a good restaurant, and they filled
our Thermos with coffee for the morning. Yes!

"What should we do tomorrow?" Dan said. "If it dawns total blue
sky, we've got to go back to the Spigolo Jori."

"Otherwise something back at the Falzarego Pass," I said.

"Exactly!"

* * *

Amazingly, the day did dawn warm and blue. We packed the tent and enjoyed the
still-hot coffee. We ate pastries while we sorted gear.
The old woman in the wheelchair came out again and watched us leave.

Another party was behind us on the trail, and another ahead, so it felt 
"crowded." A great chat about economics, goals and value systems made the
time pass quickly. Today we found the "earth gully" we needed. It was off
on a side trail marked with cairns. The base of the route was much easier to
find than the incorrect route we'd gotten on Saturday. 

We decided to double one of Dan's 70 meter ropes for the first section, and
keep the other rope in a pack. Dan took off, combining the first two 30
meter easy pitches. Then we carried coils a ways up to a headwall. More
enjoyable pitches followed, not too hard, just a warm-up for what would follow.

From Dan's belay on the left side of a band, we left the domain of several
parties and crossed the face to reach the "Jori" Arete. We had a great view
there of several parties on the Dimai route, climbing in and out of chimneys.
After a rest, I started up a steep stemming crack/chimney. Dan took over, 
climbing a featured face to a belay below an impressive yellow roof. 
There was a funny metal bar to use as protection at one point on this
pitch. Otherwise, it was the occasional cam or nut. We kept hoping to combine
a few pitches in one, but didn't get the chance until the first grade V pitch.
I climbed a short, easy pitch below, then went around the corner and decided
to head up into a broad face. I followed my nose to the center, then 
entered a striking crack on the left. Gulp. It felt kind of scary for some
reason, I think because Dan was far out of sight at a belay 40 meters below.
For a pitch like this, it's nice to have your belayer visible. But anyway,
no turning back now. Traversing a slab into the crack, I found it too wide
to hand jam, so I awkwardly placed a large cam from an arm barring position.
Higher, I found a piton, and then a hand jam now and then. Ah, they are
so nice! I crept up, realizing it was the hardest "trad" climb I'd done
since moving to Germany. I breathed carefully, pasting feet on nubbins
or jamming them securely in the crack. The pitch was kind of a wake up
call to harder climbing. I was apprehensive about 3 more grade V pitches!

Dan came up well, getting a chance to work on crack climbing skills.
"Good job, Michael!" he said. "Thanks, it was tough!"

Then I carefully gave him the flaked out rope and impatiently started up
a vertical crack off the belay. Foolishly, we'd forgotten that because I
was taking the next pitch, the rope was flaked the wrong way. Then I, in
my tension (also worrying about the gathering clouds), cursed mightily
when Dan needed me to wait for him to fix the rope. Stress!

After another fraught minute, Dan lowered me to the belay and we started
working to untangle the ropes. What a nightmare! But it was a
good exercise for our patience. 70 meters of two 8.1 mm ropes can really
be tough to deal with. By the time I set off again, we could pretty much laugh
about the mishap, and I definitely felt sorry for being so irritable.
Dan "handled" things really well. Clearly, he's been in tense situations before
and knows the right thing to do. Good learning experience!

Soon we were at the base of the crux pitch, also grade V, but it looked very
steep. After initial easy terrain there was a thin finger crack with some
kind of fixed sling. Then a wide-looking chimney/crack that didn't overhang
as long as you squeezed in the right way. After the finger crack, I also
found a neat intermediate belay bolt...what a spectacular ledge it stood
on! But I continued on, and found the chimney very awkward with my pack.
I had to stop and rest a couple of times, once on a piton and once on
a Camelot I hid in the crack. "Man, I will sleep well tonight!" I said.

Above this we had an easier V- pitch, then Dan led a couple of IV/IV+
pitches. On the last one, he dealt with a steep chimney by moving out
right onto a face, then climbing a grade III shallow chimney to reach
a belay. This maneuver felt pretty hard, and I was glad we only had
one pitch to go. Easy ground led to a kind of tricky frost-fractured
chimney, and then I crabbed left at the top where it started to
overhang. Above this was the summit cross, and I could belay Dan
from a slung block.

At the top, heartfelt congratulations all around. No one was here, as
the Dimai parties certainly got ahead of us. We were hoping
(idealistically) to get back to Munich by 10:30 pm to get Dan's
girlfriend at the airport. After we added things up in the evening
light, it was clear we wouldn't make it. We tried to hurry down
anyway, taking the "Stroebel" via ferrata, which seemed to go on
forever. It was pretty interesting, especially because it gave great
views back on the Jori ridge and the Dimai face. We finally reached a
dirt road and followed it back to the Putti Institute. 

The long drive home was, well, long. I think Dan drove the whole
thing. I just replayed great pitches in my head and dreamed of future
trips. Thanks for a great time, Dan!
