### Westliche Karwendelspitze
<i>August 4, 2011</i>

Cesar and I hiked up to the summit, in blowing clouds and rain. We took the klettersteig variation to the top, which was a bit uncomfortable as the wind and rain picked up. We had to be very careful on the slippery, sometimes muddy rock. Cesar did very good for such ridiculous conditions! We stopped on the way up at the Mittenwalderh√ºtte for tea and strumpets, even played some guitar. 1400 meters elevation gain.
