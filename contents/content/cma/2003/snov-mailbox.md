<h3>Mailbox Peak, November 10, 2003</h3>

With Carlos Pessoa. We made pretty quick work of this hike, reaching the summit
in 2 hours - I think that means we climbed a bit more than 2000 feet per hour.
I had not really been looking forward to this long slog of a hike on a 
morning trip, as you have to climb so far to get any views. However, things
went more quickly than I expected, probably because the last time I came here
with Peter Chapman, we had knee deep snow to climb through in the last mile.
The final hike up rocky ground with light snow to the summit was really 
enjoyable, with a favorable wind and the morning sun for dramatic affect. On
top, we found the mailbox, but also a host of new items including a ladder,
a fire-hydrant and an American flag. We played around with these items as best
we could, then turned for home. 4 hours round trip.
