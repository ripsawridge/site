I just watched a movie I saw on PBS as a young fella back in the mid-1980s.
It's kind of the British version of "The Day After", and is way, way, way
more frightening!
  
  
The video is [here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2023790698427111488).
The whole almost-2-hour thing is posted. Watch and be glad we've avoided
nuclear holocaust so far!
  
  
[This guys page](http://www.geocities.com/godforgnomes/Threads.html) is
a pretty good summary of what's unique about the movie, I enjoyed reading
it.
