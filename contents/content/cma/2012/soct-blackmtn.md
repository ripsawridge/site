### Black Mountain, Mountain View, CA
<i>October, 2012</i>

A great after work trail run up this peak, starting from the Rhus Ridge trail
parking lot, and getting on the Black Mountain Trail. I had a terrible
headlamp, not good enough for the nerve-wracking descent...constantly afraid
I'd run into a tree in the dark forests! I really had to go on faith a lot.
About 700 meters up and down.
