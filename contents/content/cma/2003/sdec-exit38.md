<h3>Exit 38 Dry Tooling, December 4, 2003</h3>

Alex and I each led the M3+/M4 bolted line on the Black Ice Wall. I nearly died of
pain when my fingers froze near the top - I had foolishly worn fingerless gloves.
The severe wind froze them quickly, and the re-warming was sooo painful. The
climbing was fun though, gotta get back for the rest of the "routes."
