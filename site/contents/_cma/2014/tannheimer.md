Benoit and I had been planning to go on a climb for quite a while, finally the
opportunity arose on the first decent weekend in quite a while. We had Sunday
free, and soon were hiking up into the Tannheimer Mountains to climb "Wirklich
Oben Bist Du Nie," a great VI+ climb that I'd done once before with Sebastien.

We swapped leads all the way up. I got pitch one, with a nice bit of sustained
VI+ climbing at mid-height. Benoit took the shallow dihedral on pitch 2 (VI+),
and then I led the easier-than-it-looks roof of pitch 3 (VI+) that leads to an
easier but highly enjoyable bit of chimney climbing.

I envied Benoit for pitch 4, a great bit of slab climbing with a tricky move
getting your whole body onto the slab (VI+). But that's okay, pitch 5 is
incredible...making a long and sustained journey up a vertical face on small
holds (VI+). I enjoyed that so much!

The last pitch finally relented in the grade, but was still good (VI). Benoit
brought me to the summit and we admired how the world was looking from up there.

<i>Happy climbers!</i>

We rappeled. I had some excitement on the second rappel, a full free hanging 50
meter job. The rope was caught far to the side of me and slightly above. I had
to do considerable work to free it, and then I ended up below the anchor. I had
to climb up, making backup knots in the rope as I went. Whew.

Once down, we went over to climb Paradies (VI+), which I'd climbed years ago
with Uli. I enjoyed it so much then, it was also worth repeating. It was getting
cold, and it looked like it might rain, too. Let's hurry!

I combined P1 and P2 for an amazing sustained VI+ 50 meter pitch. Here it is:

<i>Wow...what a pitch!</i>

This was balm for the soul after a rainy winter with no climbing outside!

Benoit continued for pitch 3 (V+), and then I made the short traverse around the
corner (VI- or VI, but just a one-move-wonder). Now we got confused, because I
remembered continuing around to the left, but the bolts led up and right. Benoit
gave it a go, but the moves were quite uncertain and we'd climbed a lot! So I
gave it a run, and based on what he'd already figured out, I was able to get
around the corner to easier ground. I continued up to a belay, and after Benoit
came up we wondered how to get down. The book described a rappel route, but we
couldn't find it. So, sadly, in our rock shoes we traversed left to the Gimpel
descent trail. And we even felt uncomfortable on that traverse so we hiked up to
the ridge crest, and then down on the descent trail. Whew! A full day. It felt
great to get back to our rock shoes.

Later, on the internet, I discovered that the rappel route had been dismantled
due to a tragic accident. A hiker was killed when a climber dislodged a rock on
rappel. It was decided that the rappel line was too loose and dangerous. Also,
the last pitch of Paradies was re-routed, explaining my confusion where the
route went a different way than I expected.

We got a beer with a couple of other guys who had climbed the Gimpel that day,
enduring a long line of novice climbers. Then we hiked down, discovering
Benoit's car was the last in the parking lot.

Thanks for a fun time Benoit!
