Peter 
and I decided to take a morning hike to look at Mount Kent. This
very interesting peak isn't mentioned in the normally comprehensive
Cascade Alpine Guide, but it probably should be. Mount Kent presents a
steep north facing wall to drivers on interstate 90. It is visible
just east of McClellan's Butte, and is just as impressive in it's
way. I first heard about the peak when Phil F. and Dave B. climbed a
steep line
last January. They also reported that Dallas Kloke made the first
ascent of the face in 1994 via an "obvious gully." We also knew that
Eric Hoffman had climbed a gully on the east face and named it 
"Eric's
Couloir."


We didn't bring a rope, and just figured we'd find the easiest way up.
As it turned out we both forgot our watches, so we spent a lot more
time than we should have! We quickly hiked to the logging road that
crosses the McClellan's Butte trail, and turned left. The bushwhack up
Alice Creek didn't look appealing, so we continued on a spur which
obligingly entered the valley below the face. We dropped down when the
road ended and crossed Alice Creek, heading straight up for a nice
looking gully on the left side of the north face. As we climbed it, we
thought it might be Eric's Gully, but later found that was further to
the east. In times of avalanche hazard, this would be a dangerous
place, as debris filled the whole basin, and the couloir in
particular.


We climbed without crampons, though occasionally they would have been
helpful on the chunky debris buried under a covering layer of
snow. The angle was a pretty steady 45 to 50 degrees. The couloir is
entered at about 3600 feet and climbed to a headwall blocking the way
at 4200 feet. Here we traversed left 50 feet to steep but forested
slopes that gained a ridge. From here we kept climbing to a false
summit at 4700 feet, with the true summit a quarter mile away at 5087
feet. Even without watches we knew we should head back from our "Dawn
Patrol" morning trip!


We climbed down and enjoyed an awesome 600 foot glissade down the
couloir.  We continued down to the valley bottom and hiked directly to
the road along Alice Creek. The easiest way is to stay on the west
side of the creek and piece together open areas. Travel near the creek
is more tedious, so if you can stay 50-100 feet above it is
quicker. We named the gully the "Dawn Couloir," and it seems to be a
great way up or down the mountain, provided snow conditions are
stable.
