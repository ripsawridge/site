I'll cut to the chase. This is an amazing climb. Maximize your window and

Aidan Haley and Theron Welch. Theron wrote a story about it on

<i>The morning sun hitting the Black Buttes to the west. We began hiking at 1:15 am. A few hours sleep at the car gave us a surprising boost.</i><br></center>

<i>Topping out on the first pitch, I look back. A party of four stops to watch.</i><br></center>

<i>Aidan took a interesting way, leading us under dripping seracs to...more dripping seracs! For beta-masters, the climber going straight up is taking the quicker way.</i><br></center>

As Phil Fortier once said, "The route was a lot more varied than I 
thought it would be - seemed like we were always travelling through 
interesting terrain, winding among seracs, with lots of exciting exposure 
in places."

<i>Phil was right.</i><br></center>

<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/celticcross2.gif" align=left>I don't have any summit pictures, 
as film was running low. We were on top at 12 noon,
hanging out for an hour eating and naming peaks. A father of
wilderness protection for the mountains at our feet has just died.

Ira Spring's</a> tireless efforts and enthusiasm made it possible for us to climb
today. What will we do for the next generation? There are signs they prefer
TV to this sort of thing. But then again, so did I. I'm just trying to catch up.

<i>Our vaunted strength finally ran out on the Roman Wall. Difficult footing in deep snow and incredible heat had their way with us. Aidan involuntarily sits, giving me an excuse to do the same.</i><br></center>

<i>There were some bright spots. Here, Aidan slides down glacier slopes. Signs at the trailhead warn against doing this with good reason. I slid carelessly right over a crevasse in the playground atmosphere of the lower slopes. Though I laughed with the passerbys, I knew I was lucky to escape injury.</i><br></center>
