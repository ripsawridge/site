### West Fork Foss River, 12/23/04}
There are only trace amounts of snow to Trout Lake, and increasing
snow to Copper Lake, although a boot track exists to there. Snowshoes
would be desirable beyond. The weather was good, with great views at
Copper Lake. I would have loved to continue on to Big Heart Lake! 4
hours car to car.
