### Flintsbach climbing
_July 5, 2020_

In the evening, we went and did several climbs.

  * "Nur Fliegen ist schöner" (7-)
  * Top-rope on the 6- unnamed route just to the left
  * "Felsrowdy" - pitch one (5), and pitch two (6+/7-). I had to try a few times in the
    middle of pitch two. I wanted to follow the line straight up instead of going
    to the easier left side. Finally I was satisfied to go left for two moves, and then
    back along the line.
  * "Früchte der Saison" (6+/7-) - I'd forgotten the tricky traverse move that gains the
    upper wall of this climb. I did some aid tricks to get a top rope and try everything
    until finally I figured it out. Top-roped it again.
  * "Miles Davies" (6-) - Jong led this very nicely. I re-climbed with the draws in
    place but I lost my nerve at the 3rd clip -- I hung on the rope and worked out the moves.
    I did manage to do the overhang "direct," which is supposedly 6+ but it didn't seem that
    difficult to me.
  * "Kinderleicht" (6-) - I did the slabby 6- section, though it can be avoided with
    chalked-up holds to the left. Great climb.

### Morsbach climbing
_June 24, 2020_

Jong and I spent the morning climbing at Morsbach. Did a number of routes from 5+ to 7-,
not always successfully! First in the middle part of the slab, where I also hoped
to climb the 6- corner "Verschneidung," but it was extremely wet. Then on the left side.
Feet and fingers sore -- very good!

### Lausberg (attempt)
_May 22, 2020_

I should have stayed home! But I started walking from the Isarhorn
campground at 11:30 am, intending boldly to traverse to the
Soiernspitze (ha!). Didn't even make the first summit, rather sad!

### Flintsbach

_May 18, 2020_

Barbara and I climbed a few pitches here. It was her first time on
rock in a long time. I was unfortunately rather blase about that and put
her on hard things! But we had fun on easier routes, too.

### Wendelstein

_May 16, 2020_

Barbara, Doris, Wolfi and I hiked up the Wendelstein, having a great time.
Good fun!

### Flintsbach

_May 11, 2020_

Morning trip to Flintsbach with Jong. We climbed a few routes on the
main wall, then went over the top and down to Steinmaus territory.
A bit of climbing there, then home (We did 6 pitches).

### Grubereck

_May, 2020_

After work I hiked up Grubereck from Kreuth. Interesting steep forested valley
climb to a saddle north of the summit. Lots of logging here. I thought I'd
go over to the Risserkogel but I was getting hungry so I headed down to
the south, then made the long road walk out to the main road and back to
town. About 1100 meters up/down.

### Wildbarren

_May 3. 2020_

Barbara and the small dog headed up again on the north side, then taking
the steep logging turn-off to get on the North Ridge. Gorgeous. Little
bit of fresh falling snow below the summit. Then sun. Down to the southwest,
then my cut-off through dense wood to drop to the knoll above the lake.
After the lake, up and over up and down to the Hohe Asten lodge, now
closed due to plague. From there, as directly down to the valley
as possible, following ridge spurs, bits of logging track, basically
whatever we could find. 1550 meters up and down.

### Sulzberg

_April. 2020_

B. and Mara and I hiked up early in the morning. Was great! Trail running
lesson for B. on the way donw.

### Bischof

_April, 2020_

I hiked up Farchant and Bischof. Was great!

### Brünnstein

_April, 2020_

Hike up after work one day. 1150 meters up and down.

### Wank

_April, 2020_

Fun hike up the Wank, using a new south eastern approach (for me).
1100 meters up/down.

### Wildbarren again

_April 10, 2020_

This time up the steep hunter's trail, then down a kind of "normal way"
to the west. 1100 meters up/down.

### Wendelstein

_April, 2020_

Hiked up from the east by a small lake, gathering a sub-summit. Then down
via a northern valley route. 1650 meters up and down.

### Stepbergalm

_April 5, 2020_

Barbara and I hiked up to the Stepbergalm near the
Kramerspitze, an old favorite. About 1000 meters up/down.

### Wildbarren and Rehleitenkopf

_February 22, 2020_

Wonderful day up Wildbarren a new way, down to the south to the lake,
then over and across to the Rehleitenkopf in falling snow. Down
through a wonderful "klamm." Elevation gain/loss about 1700 meters.

### Wildbarren

_February 21, 2020_

Barbara and I on the Wildbarren for the first time. A wonderful day!
Two steep and interesting _Jägersteige_. 1100 meters up/down.

### Lampsenspitze

_February, 2020_

Barbara's first ski tour! We had a great time, though we stopped short of the
summit. She is skiing great in powder. Was really fantastic...

### Ebnerjoch

_February 8, 2020_

Snowshoe hike up the Ebnerjoch by myself. A good time! About 1000 meters up.

### Kranzhorn and Sulzberg

_February 1, 2020_

Great hike, no need for snowshoes. I took my "direct route" up at the
level-off point, this time climbing to the summit above the chapel.
The inside of the chapel was beautiful. I really liked the image of
Jesus as a child, with the cross behind him and a shining light.
The image reminded me of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, with Joseph
and Mary serving as the pillars of Severity and Mercy, with the
Christ child in approximately the right position for the sphere
Tiphareth, where, in fact, he "belongs" as intermediary between
humanity and the Godhead. Anyhows, go up and see 'ems for yourself. :)

I had this thought:

> Note the childs joy. And it is the Cross behind which will break
> him. And yet, remains the Source of his Light. May we all find
> our Cross, and meet it with Joy.

Okay! Next hike! I wanted about another 600 meters or so, and found it
in a charming mountain called Sulzberg. Really neat steep trail up
the east side of the peak. Up and down before the evening began.

~1500 meters up and down with the two peaks.

### Wallberg

_January 19, 2020_

A nice hike up.

### Wallberg

_January 12, 2020_

A nice hike up. I felt very, very happy. I shaved my head, too. Heh!
