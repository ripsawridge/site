South Early Winter's Spire and Concord Tower
------------

* Southwest Rib (5.8) and the Cave Route (5.7+)
* September, 2002

Chris
 and I were keen for some rock climbing at Washington Pass.
Dan and Aidan were coming too, but realized it would be a long day
from Tacoma and didn't want to get back too late. So they went
for a day at Index while we left
early in the morning, arriving at the hairpin turn below the
spires. Immediate full-body shivering convinced us to abandon a
more ambitious objective for something smaller and hopefully
sunnier!

So we parked at the Blue Lake trailhead, and headed up first on
trail, then into the forest for the basin below South Early
Winter's Spire. We decided to climb the Southwest Buttress (also
called the Southwest Rib). It was rated 5.8, and is about 8
pitches long. We changed to rock shoes at a little platform
with a tree, then Chris took the first long lead. I reached his
stance after following cracks and chimneys to a tree. From here,
I took a very short 4th class lead (20 feet) to the base of the 
obvious very nice looking 5.8 crack. I was a little miffed when
Chris claimed this lead for himself ("It's my turn," he said
with a grin). Oh well, I guess he was
getting cold at his tree belay and wanted to keep going.
Chris reached a belay, and I followed. But the rope got stuck
on a chock-stone, so I had to self-belay myself with a Muenter
hitch. The pack and all the rope fiddling made this crack
pretty awkward. I cursed my way up to the chock-stone where
I freed the rope to get an active belay again.


My lead was again about 20 feet long, a 5.2 corner crack.
Chris came up and sympathized with my complaint 
that the odd pitches are stellar, and the even pitches are
mere connectives. He offered me the next pitch, but I
declined, somewhat mad at myself for caring so much. I
must be getting old and cranky. 
Anyway, we both thought this was
probably the most spectacular pitch of the route. It went around
a corner then up increasingly slabby terrain to some exposed
moves that gain a belay platform. I continued from there,
climbing the twin off-width cracks called the "bear hug." I was
able to put two large pieces in at the base of the cracks, but
nothing above. That's fine, it's pretty easy to just power up
to the top of the cracks. From there, nice scrambling got me
to a belay directly above Chris. It was nice to be in the sun,
which was only now starting to have a warming effect. Traces
of fresh snow were laying on the shaded ledges.


Chris led a long pitch, mostly easy but he spiced it up with
some nice variations. Then I led to the summit. Some people rappel
into a dirt gully and climb back up the other side. It is much
more pleasing to traverse the "rabbit ears" and come out right
at the notch. Don't walk in the dirt good people! The final
short "5.2" hand crack was nice.


So we enjoyed the summit for a while, once again (like a few weekends
before on Cutthroat) really happy with the view. Chris had me take some pictures
of him with his camera that came out terribly. We hiked down the
Arete. I was amazed at how different it seemed from my previous visit,
in June 1999. At that time, the Arete was a 
thrilling and dangerous alpine climb!
Now merely a pleasant scramble. Still, we prudently made two
single-rope rappels at the bottom.


What next? The Beckey Route was getting sun, which had strong appeal
for us both. But I really wanted to
climb something new. Chris suggested the Cave Route on Concord Tower.
He had climbed it a few months ago, but vaguely knew of a variation
above the Cave that would be more challenging. So we hiked up the
gully to the base of the route. Of course, we were on the shady side,
so it was back to blowing on fingers to keep warm! I led the first
pitch, stopping now and then to do this. At the crux, I fretted a little
bit because there was a difficult move followed by what appeared
to be a corner with no gear possibilities. But after I committed to
the move and got up there, I found a nice hand jam. I found a nice
piece of gear on this pitch too! (If you can describe it, I will
return it to you :-)) Chris led an interesting pitch traversing
back around a corner to the cave. Meanwhile, some guys descended from the
Beckey Route and got their rope stuck. They waited patiently for another
party to come down and help. 


From the Cave, Chris suggested climbing straight up from the mouth, or
somewhere off to the left. Straight up looked protectable, so I did this.
Chris thought it would be 5.9, so it felt serious! But I found it getting
easier and easier, and reached the summit pretty sure that it was 5.6 or
5.7. Chris came up and said 5.6. Concord Tower has a really nice
pointy summit, with a great vertical view down to the highway.
We made 4 single-rope rappels to reach 
the notch between Concord Tower and Liberty Bell. Hiking down the trail,
we paused for a while in the last of the larch tree and boulder terrain.
I "drank deeply" of the countryside, then we hiked quickly to the car.


So these are a couple of routes that good folk may enjoy.
