_This is actually a post from a year ago, but it got lost when I moved blogs around_.

I really love this incredible song by [Max Richter](http://www.maxrichter.com/en/index.php),
"[On the Nature of Daylight](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Notebooks-Max-Richter/dp/B0001FT2EE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1290379018&sr=8-1),"
from the album "The Blue Notebooks." I decided to make my own version of
the song for acoustic and electric guitar, plus some keyboard noodling.
I uploaded it to SoundCloud [here](https://soundcloud.com/ripsawridge/on-the-nature-of-daylight)

It took me a few weeks. First I had to figure out the music. It's a beautiful
string quartet and a synthesizer bass (I think). It's in B-flat minor,
without a single accidental. Beauty and variation come from the simple
lines maintained in the different parts, and the song adds layers in a
minimalistic style.

My rendition can't compete with the original at all, it's just that I
liked it so much I had to try. The biggest problem with mine, I think,
is that I have a fixed tempo, which destroys too much musicality. I don't
really know how to multitrack without a set tempo, if you have any advice
let me know...

I overdubbed 4 acoustic guitar parts, and 3 electric guitar parts (2 are
mostly doubling the same line).

Anything by Max Richter is great, I've become a big fan over the last
few months.
