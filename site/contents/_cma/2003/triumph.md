<h2>Northeast Ridge (5.7)</h2>
<h3>July 19-20, 2003</h3>


<font size=+5>I had long wanted </font> to climb the Northeast Ridge of Mt. Triumph, which had
all the elements of a great Cascades climb: scenery, a glacier approach
and a steep ridge climb. Despite just returning from
a climbing trip to Colorado, Theron was immediately up for the challenge.
He wrote about the story on
<a href="http://www.theronwelch.com/mountains/pnw/north/triumph/index.htm">his site</a>.


We took a 50 meter 8.5 mm rope which we doubled for the rock climbing.
I had a new 40 degree summer bag and was pleased as punch at how small it
compacted in my pack. We took rock shoes, a small rack of gear (I decided
to leave out the #3 Camalot required for the wide crack and just run it out),
crampons and ice axes. I carried a bivy sack, but convinced Theron to leave
his - "No way it's gonna rain!" We carried lightweight rain shells, me going
so far as to use a $10.00 shell that compresses to the size of my fist.

We talked and sometimes listened to music on our Rios on the way up.
It seemed to take a long time to reach the slope above Thornton Lakes,
but a great view there gave us more energy. We made an error by continuing
past the outlet of the 2nd lake (you are supposed to cross here), and 
following a sketchy trail that led to a 5th class traverse of cliffs
above the 2nd lake. Oops! We ate lunch where the stream from the
3rd lake enters the 2nd, then climbed tedious scree, boulder and
heather slopes towards our high pass, eventually intersecting
a climbers trail. We were agog at the view of the Picket Range and
our objective from the pass.

<i>But first we had a section of steep, hard snow to climb down. We were glad to have crampons for this section.</i><br></center>

We climbed two pitches on the ridge to reach our bivy site, having
great fun designating the cooking ledges, the sleeping platform,
the equipment storage locker. We had it all to ourselves, which I
thought was unusual for a summer weekend. Perhaps everyone knew the
weather would change?


The stove didn't work very well for a while, and my dinner was undercooked.
I was depressed about it, but Theron's advice to add more hot water and
heating time did the trick. Yay - no calorie deficit! When sunset finally
came after hours of lounging and speculating about routes, Theron sprung
to life with his camera. Orange then pink snowfields and ridges fascinated
us until full dark. I listened to the "Das Boot" soundtrack, which 
dramatized our lonely camp in the sky.

At 4 am we awoke to raindrops, somewhat horrified because Theron had no
cover for his sleeping bag. Feeling guilty, I worked to cover his bag with
our shells. He was too sleepy to care. Anyway, the rain stopped after 15
minutes, and with a bit of wind everything was soon dry. We started climbing
at about 6:30 am.

<i>After the wide crack, we climbed down into the Great Notch, and steeply out of it on the right side of the ridge.</i><br></center>

<i>The clouds were lowering rapidly. Still, they provided a lonely alpine ambience. I still couldn't believe we had the climb to ourselves.</i><br></center>

A few more rappels got us and our bivy gear down to the glacier.
Clouds had enveloped the summit, causing us to lose our motivation to
climb Thornton Peak on our way out. By the time we hiked down to Thornton
Lakes, the sun was back out, and we cursed it on the hot brushy trail!


Listening to music on the way out, we made good time to the car and were
driving away by 5:30 pm. We went to the park visitor center to get a final
view of the Pickets. The Chopping Block looks great from there!


<b>Notes:</b>


Scrambled up solid but exposed 5th class ledges from glacier (off route).
Joined hiking route to notch.


<b>pitch 1:</b> from notch in ridge up 25 meters to bigger notch (M)


<b>pitch 2:</b> fun 5.5 lieback up slabs that led to bivy ledge. (M)


<b>pitch 3:</b> Long simulclimb up gully left of crest, to 3rd class walking. Around and over
towers to a belay at the end of a stunning knife edge. (T)


<b>pitch 4:</b> Simulclimb from here over a tower then up the "5.7 wide crack" mentioned
in guidebooks. 2 nut belay at the top of the crack. (M)


<b>pitch 5:</b> up a fun friction slab, around a corner, then down into the Great Notch. (T)


<b>pitch 6:</b> Exciting, steep climbing out of the notch and on to the summit on
progressively easier terrain. (T)


Descent:


Downclimb to a rappel into the great notch. Walking led to a short downclimb pitch
of the fun friction slab. Rappel past the "5.7 wide crack". Another rappel down
to near the knife edge. Simul-climbing along the knife edge, and down past another
rappel station to a 5.5 face traverse (rope drag here). More simul-climbing led
to another rap station atop a steep, blocky face. One rappel here, and some tricky
free solo downclimbing as it started to rain. More simul-climbing on 3rd class
terrain led to the final rappel station above the bivy site. One snag-free rappel
to the bivy site. From there, we made three rappels down to the notch, and scrambled down to the glacier.
