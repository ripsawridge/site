A day trip from the car by the normal route. A week of bad weather left the
mountain very snowy. It took me a bit over 4 hours to go up and down from the
Innsbrucker Hut. The fresh snow and occasional showers of rain and snow made the
going slow and a bit tricky. Impressive mountain, I'd like to come back for more
routes.
