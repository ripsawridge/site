### Kramerspitz
_December 8, 2013_

A snowshow trip up Kramerspitz, going the easy way past the meadow up and down. I had to break trail from the meadow and hut in deep, unconsolidated snow. That took some effort! Then some rather delicate snow conditions a bit below the summit traversing a slope with bad runout. I should have done this without snowshoes, on the way back it was much easier/safer without them. I'm not sure how long it took, but I'm guessing between 7 and 8 hours.
