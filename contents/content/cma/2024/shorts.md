### Breitenstein
_May 10, 2024_

Barbara and Sammy and I hiked up the Breitenstein.

### Stanser Joch
_May 2, 2024_

I hiked up from Stans, following the bee-line straight from town up to
the little broken-down house 1400 meters up the slope. I listened to
interesting podcasts, especially one about the archeology of Sodom.
Fascinating! It seems that God rained hellfire on the city as the Bible
states. What a strange story that is...I think a mark of it's truth is the
rather poor behavior of Lot, who, rather than turning over the angels to
the wicked men of the city "so that we may know them," was happy to turn
over his virgin daughters to them. What the heck? It is a dreamlike story
(a very bad dream). It is good to have a God who reaches into the world
to correct us, I am certain.

Anyway, my feet became cold on the march to the summit in recent and sometimes
knee-deep snow. Bad weather was brewing to the west. I decided to continue
along the ridge to the east and come down to Jenbach. This went well enough
for a while, but gosh, the toes were getting cold. I should have worn thicker
socks! Finally I reached a little hunting stand where I could leave the
ridge to the north where I saw tantalizing dry ground below at the
Heiterlahn Alm. I wished for an ice axe as I traversed steep slopes in
the snow. In total I made 4 traverses to stay on the trail which cunningly
avoided steep ground amid latschen bushes, scruffy cliffs and smallish trees.
I had old tracks of a beast to follow (probably Gämse). Near the bottom, I
had to reclimb because I'd left the trail and ended up, predictably enough
in a miserable grove of latschen and rotting snow. I limped on frozen feet
to the Hochleger at the Alm, squeezed the water out of my socks and set to
drying and warming them. Whew!

Below the Alm, steep trail and many Gämse around got me down to the
Rödelhüttenweg. Great views of the Rofan Mountains from here. I walked through
Jenbach, then another 6 kilometers back to my car in Stans. I rested aching
feet and lay on the grass for a while at the Tratzberg castle.

An interesting, varied day -- and a lesson on the importance of good, thick
socks for walking in snow in trail runners! 1600 meters up/down and about 20
kilometers.

### Heuberg
_May 1, 2024_

A wonderful day with Barbara and Sammy. On the way down I discovered how to
get Sammy to walk behind me, somewhat unwillingly. I keep at least one hand
or both behind my back, with the leash, and keep it just on the edge of feeling
where he is. He gets more slack if he stays back there. This is really helpful
on steep trails where he can easily pull me down the hill if I'm not careful.
We also tried letting him off the leash a couple times. The second time was
a disaster. We spent 10+ minutes criss-crossing steep slopes trying to get
him back. Uff!

### Sulzberg
_April 26, 2024_

Nice hike up with Barbara and Sammy. We went down a pleasant trail to the
north this time.

### Flintsbach climbing
_April 17, 2024_

Time to try out some rope soloing! I led "Frauenschuhe" (5+) with my solo
setup, then top-roped it 2 more times. Then I led "Kinderleicht" (6-) and
top-roped that twice. Then I went around to the Steinbruch sector and
admired the fresh rockfall, apparently from earlier in the month. But
I could still climb the first pitch of "Normalweg" (probably rated
4), then did a top rope of the first pitch of "Kombination" (6-) and
traversed left to the anchor. 8 nice pitches on a fine, windy evening.

### Wendelstein
_April 5, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up the Wendelstein from Bayrischzell. A great hike,
but marred slightly by Sammy jumping up to surprise a woman because she had
a small dog in her jacket. I pulled him away and the party was angry with
us.

### Spitzsteinu
_March 22, 2024_

We'd never been up this peak, but had a great time. This mountain is
sure to go on the repeat list! Quite rocky and rather slow near the summit.
Barbara said she might start drinking beer at a hut, because the coffee
is way too variable!

### Naunspitze
_March 15, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up the Naunspitze from a very steep trail
that passed a climbing area. On the way down I had a beer and Apfelstruedl.

### Rehleitenkopf
_March 8, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up past the beautiful waterfalls beside the great
quarry. Her first visit to the Rehleitenkopf summit. It is "International
Womans Day." A day invented by communists to divide the family. To create
resentment. To break the good shells that shelter us, and leave us exposed,
supposedly "free." I want nothing to celebrate "me." I only want to celebrate
us. Resentment is battery acid.

A scene at the ski depot on Zischgeles.

After staying the night in Axams, I got up early and skinned up Zischgeles.
What a huge mountain! Entertaining scrambling to the summit from the ski depot.
The sun came out right at the summit, which was nice because it had been
cold, cloudy, and sometimes too windy. I took the left variant down, visiting
a hanging valley west of the normal ascent way.

### Schöntalspitze
_March 2, 2024_

What a great ski tour. Well, the snow in the lower section was quite difficult
refrozen crust. But the upper section was great. Tiring skinning in the last
100 meters to the ski depot. In fact, I slipped and got a muscle cramp in
my left arm trying to stay attached to the slope! A good day.

### Wildbarren
_March 1, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up the road, then the north ridge, and down
the southwest side. Wonderful day.

### Sulzberg
_February 25, 2024_
A great hike with Barbara and Sammy

### Kranzhorn
_February 16, 2024_
Me, Barbara and Sammy enjoyed ourselves here.

### Gindelalm
_February 9, 2024_

Barbara, Sammy and I hiked up the Gindelalm.

### Heuberg
_February 4, 2024_

Me and Sammy hiked up Heuberg. My first time taking him alone.

### Hike above Klausen
_January 27, 2024_

Interesting visit to the abbey above the town on the hillside. I prayed
a bit in the church, then wandered back into the cold, cold valley floor
of the Tinnebach. Thence up and back around towards the sun by an old
mine, and out into the sun on the road down to Villanders, where I looked
in vain for a restaurant. Galumpfed thence down to Klausen and a
early dinner in a good pizzeria. About 1100 meters up and down.

### Königsanger
_January 26, 2024_

Nice hike up Königsanger from Verdings. I got a hitch down from the official
parking lot back to Verdings from a nice cross-country skiing fella who
lives in Feldthurns down the road. He grew up nearby, nice guy. I used
snowshoes for the upper half, though snow became wet, deep and heavy on
the way down. Day started out sunny, later with ominous clouds.

### Feldalphorn ski
_January 19, 2024_

Skied up and down the Feldalphorn. Snow not super awesome.
It was very cold. I used a little video camera to film, but threw the
footage away (boring).

### Ski with Josef and Kirill
_January 14, 2024_

Great day with Josef and Kirill on Gerstinger Joch. We didn't visit the
true summit, but came close. Pretty nice snow! On the way down, we lost
Kirill for a while, and had a fun time searching with avalanche beacon
on the slope.

### Kranzhorn
_January 5, 2024_

Nice hike up and down.
