### Mount Dickerman (partial), 12/26/2000

Is it unusual to be able to drive to the trail-head after Christmas? The trail is free of snow, but a little icy for much of the way in the forest. Snowshoes aren't needed until the long traverse on steeper slopes just above 4000 feet. Views of Vesper Peak, Sperry Peak, Big Four and Hall Peak were excellent. The trail ended, and I blazed to about 4400 feet. I turned around there because I had to be home by one, I somehow thought the summit was 6500 feet (demoralizing), and I had no idea I was just below
appealing, gentler slopes! Lesson - don't forget the map!
It was a peaceful morning in the mountains, with some weak yellow sun.


### Urban hike - Costco to home, 12/17/2000

I had really wanted to do some hiking this weekend, so I was bummed to be hanging around the
Kirkland "Costco" store amid the milling consumers. Kris and Marco left me there with a map at
4:00 pm. I had a pretty enjoyable walk home, a total distance of 10 miles. I took a route
over some hills, passing a cider farm where I enjoyed fresh apple cider and petted some dogs.
I passed a local pizza business that wouldn't sell me a slice. I was home in just under 3 hours.
Different, but still rewarding.


### Lake Serene, 12/12/2000

I took a pre-work jaunt up to this cold sub-alpine basin. The trail is easy to follow all the way 
to the lake, despite some dry, fluffy snow on the upper staircases. I have to admit, I like the 
stairs! It was a beautiful morning to watch the sun turn Mt. Persis gold, and see burning orange 
cloud wisps and blue sky over Mt. Index. The lake is frozen. I would almost try walking on it, 
but I have a healthy sense of self-preservation. It's amazing that the elevation is only 2700 
feet. Bridel Veil Falls is festooned with icicles.  


### Steven's Pass Skiing, 12/??/2000

Shari, Roland, Kris, Marco and I went for a few hours of skiing. Shari got an injury, but she's
ok now.


### Mt. Townsend, 12/02/2000

Jake and 
Peter met me at the Edmonds ferry, which I barely jumped onto before
it left, and we met 
Greg before entering the maze of forest roads east of the
Buckhorn Wilderness. We got a bit lost, then had a flat tire to repair. Jake
thumbed through the guidebook describing our proposed Tunnel Creek hike, and
espied a trail up Mt. Townsend. This had to be better! We agreed to head up there,
and spent more time on the confusing roads. We hit snow in the last mile.
One more storm and it won't be possible to drive to the trail-head! The hiking
was fun in crunchy snow and clearing skies. I would meander ahead now and then
to get some "cardio" training. We were a happy bunch to be under a blue sky
looking up at our peak. The trail wound up an avalanche slope, completely safe
with such low snow cover. Finally we went straight for a saddle below the summit,
getting some nice views of the Graywolf range. After a visit to the summit and
some stories, we continued telling tall (but true!) tales over lunch at the saddle.
We pored over Greg's map, naming summits and valleys for an hour before heading
down. The clouds had started to obscure views, and we were soon in a fog.
An uneventful descent, except for the time Peter and I cut a switchback down a
steep snowy slope only to end up in a tight ravine far from the trail. Oops!
At least we got to use our snowshoes traversing over to Greg and Jake, who waited
for us. We took our evening repast at the Whistling Oyster, a most excellent tavern
for the weary. 


### Barclay Lake, 11/19/2000

Kris and I were coming back from a weekend cabin near Lake Wenatchee, and I wanted
to see the North Face of Mt. Baring again. We started walking on the gentle, but icy
trail to Barclay Lake. Kris was really cold, and nervous about the ice. I sent
her back and quickly jogged to the lake and back. The face was a weeping cascade
of ice lower, and dark black rock above.


### Big Four Ice Caves, 11/10/2000

Peter and I met John B. and Wendy at the caves on a beautiful Saturday
morning. There was a dusting of snow on the ground. We set a top rope on a short
wall of overhanging ice. John, Peter and I climbed the 15 foot wall several
times, very happy to have helmets and goggles for the occasions when the ice
tools came out of the ice suddenly and unexpectedly! John and Wendy had to go,
so Peter and I climbed 400 feet up to the *Bergshrund* at the back of the
caves. Here, Peter set a top rope above a 70 degree ice/snow slope. This was a
*blast*, the climbing was easy but thrilling. We were running late for our
afternoon appointments, so we hurried down before getting to really explore the
many short climbs in this area.

### Vantage with Kris 10/15/2000

Kris and I hadn't climbed together in quite a while, and we missed
that a lot.  So a trip to Frenchmen's Coulee was called for. We did
several easier climbs at the Feathers (old favorites), then headed to
the Sunshine Wall. There, I climbed "Party in your Pants" (5.8, trad),
a classic crack route. This climb was pretty long, I had to rest on
the rope a few times to finish it. But the jamming was very
straightforward and enjoyable.


### Snoqualmie Peak (almost), 9/22/2000

Peter and I planned an early morning climb of Lundin Peak's West Ridge, 
which should be an excellent 4th class scramble. He picked me up at 3 am,
and by 4:30 am we were thrashing in brush near the Snow Lakes Trailhead.
After 30 minutes of Devil's Club, we pulled out the route description again.
The trail up to Snoqualmie Peak started 50 feet to the right of the Trail-head!
We found it quickly, and tried to make up for lost time. It started to lighten
as we crossed Cave Ridge, coming to a saddle between the ridge and Snoqualmie
Peak. We decided to climb high on this peak, then traverse right to the
base of Lundin. No sooner did we begin scrambling up talus and heather, than
we realized our firm turn-around time prevented us from making the climb.
We had to be back in the city by 11 am. So we climbed "The Snow Dome" to
the right of Snoqualmie Peak. Peter insisted it was the summit, but deep in
our hearts we knew it wasn't. Clear skies and a bitterly cold wind accompanied
us down the ridge. We found that a trail goes down from the Cave Ridge/Snoqualmie
Saddle, but worried about where it went. Later, I found that it met up with the
steep trail we took up from the trail-head. So we traversed Cave Ridge, then
headed down. We met a woman who couldn't believe what we'd done, and then
she determined that we climbed the Snow Dome rather than Snoqualmie Peak.
"Oh, of course, see, I knew you couldn't climb Snoqualmie! That took me all
day long!!". To us, it seemed that since the Snow Dome was about the same
height, and if we hadn't lost 45 minutes looking for the trail, we could
have done it. Nursing our bruised egos, we tore down to the car, and to work.
At least we know something about those elusive trails up from Alpental now!

### Vantage, 09/03/2000

Sunday, I took my dad and Kitty to Vantage for some rock climbing.
He did very well, climbing Where the Sidewalk Ends, and The Becky Route.
I climbed a 5.10a on the other side of the Feathers, and a favorite:
Jesus Saves.


### Leavenworth, 08/28-29/2000

I took 
Marco climbing in Leavenworth. First we did 3 or 4 fun pitches on
Mountaineer's Dome. But I dropped his camera on the second pitch. We
watched it explode on the rocks on a long downward course! I felt terrible,
but did buy him a new one. Then we climbed the 5.7 top-rope on Barney's
Rubble, and finished the day with a supposed 5.6 crack to the left.
I'd rate it 5.7 for sustained moves with a definite "protect or go on"
quandary. We had dinner at a Bavarian Restaurant, where we met a couple from
Germany. They were from an area very close to Marco's island of Fuehr!
And the food was "pretty good", according to him...high praise from a
real German! We bivied at the 8-mile campground, under beautiful stars.
In the morning, I awoke to clear skies, but a barometer that had dropped
rapidly. Doubtfully, I looked up at the sky again, which was suddenly
filled with cloud!

But the weather was stable, so we climbed the R \& D Route. I think Marco is
correct in feeling that I sandbagged him...it was too hard for a beginner.
We did the climb in 4 pitches, and on each one Marco had a
significant challenge. He always came through, but wasn't entirely pleased.
I did a lower for Marco, then rappelled. After some tricky hiking, we were
back at the car and heading home. Marco was patient, a quick learner, and
an excellent companion. Whether he'll want to climb again is something only
he knows! ;).


### Rampart Lakes, 08/27/2000
Marco and I hiked up to Rampart Lakes, an area I'd wanted to visit for a while.
The weather was overcast, with occasional sun breaks. It was Marco's first
mountain hike. He was zooming up the trail, but found it a little tiring upon
realizing that it goes up for thousands of feet. Pacing, my boy! On the way
down, we ran great distances, and I did a somersaults on the trail, escaping
with a small cut on the knee. "You're insane!" said Marco, as I began running
again. I wonder.


### Mount Si, 07/30/2000

I made it to the top of the Haystack in 1:30, and was at the base at just under 
3 hours. I discovered a portion of the old trail in the final mile, and 
this was nice, because it goes up steeply, with no pesky switchbacks.
Heart rate: 170 bpm most of the way.


### Vantage, 07/29/2000

Kris and I climbed here with Peter and Kim, and it was a lot of fun, despite
being very hot in the sun. We climbed many routes at the Feathers, where we had
shade.  Kris did The Beckey Route (5.7), I did a 5.10a sport climb there and a
fun 5.8.  After lunch we went to the Zig Zag Wall, and I led the gear route
Jeff's Crack (5.8).  This was great fun. Peter led a trad, loose 5.7 route that
Kim and I followed.  As the sun went down, we headed over to the Sunshine Wall,
where Kris climbed Peaceful Warrior (5.6), and Peter and Kim did the classic
Clip 'em or Skip 'em (5.8).  We got back to the car at full dark.


### Leavenworth Climbing, 07/22/2000
This was supposed to be a climbing weekend, but our motivation was pretty low.
All we did was go to one Dome where I led Jazzy Document (5.9), also led a
part trad part bolted 5.9 nearby, and top-roped a 5.8+ just to the right.
We had slept in until 2 pm, so of course we didn't do anything else!


### Index Climbing, 07/21/2000

Kris and I got up early for pre-work climb of Great Northern Slab. She did really well!
I finally climbed something else at Index, with the 5.7 
Sickle Crack. I'm
really eying Libra Crack (5.8), which seems to be 3 pitches of crack and chimney
climbing. Next time, I'll do that!


### McClellan Butte, 07/17/2000

After a long rest due to injury, and a business trip to Florida, I felt flabby
and bewildered that I had missed more than a month of precious summer for
climbing. I had to see how bad the damage was, so I took the afternoon to
hike up McClellan Butte. I met many coming down, all of them warned me
about the horrors I would face without bug spray. I did get about 15 bites,
but this was only a small annoyance. The snow was interesting in my traction-less
ancient tennis shoes. The final ridge scramble was really fun. The view
was incredible. I really liked seeing that Chester Morris Lake too.
I took 2:15 up and about 1:45 down. It was nice to finally hike this peak.



### Leavenworth Climbing with Kris, 07/02/2000

We showed my parents around Leavenworth Saturday and Sunday, having a good
time in the German restaurants with them. Tom sang some excellent beer
songs, and Kris and I caught up on our "Chicken dance" practice over wurst.
Sunday,
Kris and I got in 2 pitches on Mountaineer's Dome. We did
"Left Crack" (5.6), and it was a lot of fun.


### Horrible Forbidden Peak

Steve and I hiked into Boston Basin under blue skies, having a grand ol' time.
Mat, Jeff and Jake were scheduled to hike up the next morning. We camped at 6500
feet just below the Unnamed Glacier that starts the West Ridge route.  We were
at a cliff with some water. The weather deteriorated, beginning to snow. We
slept in my clip flashlight tent. At midnight a huge ice block slammed into my
back, knocking our tent off it's platform, and leaving me full of adrenaline and
hurt. Steve thought it was an avalanche. We know the block came from the
glacier, but couldn't believe it could come so far down. 2 other parties were
camped nearby, we were just very unlucky. Steve took down the tent while I
assessed my injuries. Back and ribs were stiff, but I could walk, and figured
I'd better do that while I can. All night retreat in soaking rain. Drive sadly
home. Mat, Jeff and Jake have wonderful climb. Still recovering.  Sigh. But big
thanks to Steve for doing his all to insure I was comfortable and safe on the
way down. Thanks man!

### Miserable Gunn Peak, 06/17/2000

I decided to climb Gunn Peak on this beautiful day, but what was I thinking?
With high hopes, I hiked the incredibly overgrown road Beckey mentions.
Soon, each step became an ordeal, as young, strong trees had grown up in
the road very close together. I *think* I got to a point *close*
to where Beckey says the "trail" begins: a non-existent parking area below
a clear cut. Turning around was an agonizing decision, because I'd put 2
hours in just to this point, and trying to do something else that morning was
shot. Finally, I did turn around, and a branch promptly poked out my left
contact lens. It was my last pair, so now I don't have contacts anymore.
Disgusted, I finally arrived at the car. Thanks a lot green Beckey book!


### Exit 38 Climbing, 04/02/2000

Bob Scoverski met Kris and I around 9:30 am (yes, we were late Bob!).  Bob gave
us the tour of this area on this beautiful morning.  Kris climbed an unnamed
route that was really fun, maybe 5.7.  Bob led a great 5.9+ and I led a 5.8/5.9
to the left. Sadly, this area is so small that Kris didn't get to climb anymore,
as the easier climbs were gang top-roped and we couldn't get in despite waiting
quite a while. This rock is really strange, there are no cracks, and you really
have to search for holds sometimes. Kris and I climbed that evening at Vertical
World to make up for the crowds at Exit 38!

### Index Climbing, 04/01/2000

I finally had my chance to take Kris to Great Northern Slab,
an excellent beginner's climb. Her abilities have improved
remarkably in the past few weeks, and I felt she was ready.
We arrived at 10 or 11, and immediately had problems with the
"3rd class" chimney to get to the start of the climb. But a
belay, a handhold, and advice from below helped. It was her
first time to stick her foot in a crack and torque it!
The first pitch was tons of fun. The second pitch was harder,
and Kris used a variation around the start. She did awesome
on the twin cracks above that, cleaning gear, smiling and
climbing well! The last pitch was short, but enjoyable.
We did a double rope rappel from there, another first for my
adventurous wife. At the top of the first pitch, we ran into
trouble when one of the ropes got stuck when we pulled it down.
I climbed up and traversed over to get it, easily down-climbing.
A final rap to the ground = the end!


### Tiger Mountain, 03/31/2000

Kris needed to work later than me, so I had a few hours to
kill (from 9:00 to midnight). Calling Phil Spory was just the
ticket, as he could recommend a nice hike I could do in the
dark with no flashlight: Tiger Mountain! His directions were
good, and after 2 sweaty/chilly hours, I found myself on top
at an unremarkable summit with a radio tower. Down about 1/2
mile from the summit was the best view, of city lights
stretching to the horizon. Something dark and creepy scampered
across the logging road, freezing my heart for a moment.
I jogged all the way down, and was back to pick
Kris up at midnight.

### Camp Muir, 03/26/2000
Jake, Rob and I climbed to Camp Muir on this very sunny Sunday.
The weather was too good, in fact, because I got a pretty bad
sunburn. We all had sunscreen, but each bottle was almost empty,
providing just a small amount for my consumption! Jake pointed
out the Gibraltar Ledges route, and variations. We saw where
an avalanche had swept the snowfield below the Kautz Ice Cliff.
Late in the day, a large avalanche released on the Nisqually
Glacier, sending a plume of powder over to the Muir Snowfield.
I finished the hike in 4 hours, feeling the elevation in the
last 1000 feet. Jake and Rob came up later, and we had lunch.
Jake got some great turns on his *randonee* gear, making Rob and
I jealous! This was a great introduction to Rainier, and I feel
like I know the mountain a little better.


### Vantage Climbing, 03/25/2000

![](images/usbase.jpg)

Kris and I climbed at the Feathers all day, taking a nice break for a picnic at
noon. She did really well, climbing several mid-5th class routes. Kris got
additional rappelling practice in too. Finally, she led "Where the Sidewalk
Ends" in great style!!  I climbed a new (for me) 5.8 and 5.9 on the sunny side
of the Feathers.


### Vantage Climbing, 03/12/2000

The participants in this endeavor to see if it was too early for rock climbing
at Vantage were Peter, Jake, John B. and I.  We arrived at 10 am, discovering
that conditions were perfect: just a little cold out of the sun, but very
climbable. Not too windy, either.  John B. got his first lead in at "Where the
Sidewalk Ends (5.0)", and followed on "The Beckey Route (5.7)."  Jake did well
in tennis shoes, even leading "Peaceful Warrior (5.6)."  Peter led an excellent
5.8 sport climb at the feathers, and I lead a crack to the side. Jeses Saves
(5.8) was a great nearby sport climb. Peter led "Seven Virgins and Mule," a 5.7
excellent trad climb in a chimney. I finished the day by leading "Another Notch
in my Lipstick Case," a tough 5.7 trad climb.  All this and more!


### Skiing at Crystal, 02/19/2000

An excellent outing care of my workplace for a job well done. Most of
our team went, and we skied and snowboarded all day long. It was a
beautiful day, and for the first time, I got onto some pretty steep
slopes. Little Shot and another blue run coming down from a 6400 foot 
pass were very challenging!


### Solo climbing at Index Town Wall, 02/12/2000

I decided to climb the Great Northern Slab (yes, again!), but alone
this time. By anchoring the rope at the base of each pitch, I was
able to ascend quite safely, getting used to the awkward clove-hitch
knot as a means of paying out line. I found an easier variation
around the first steep part of the second pitch, and soon found myself
up on the wall with a tremendous view. Wow! Rapping and re-climbing the
second pitch was so much fun. I was whistling as I worked, and two
fishermen from the river saw me and pointed. They stared as I bid
farewell on the final rappel.


### Steven's Pass Skiing, 02/09/2000

Kris and I took the day off for some fun skiing with no lift-lines!
It started out rough, with very icy snow. But the day warmed up, 
and we spent most of our time on the Brooks chair. I worked up
my courage to try a steeper blue run on the east side of the basin.
I made it down alive! Kris continued working on her parallel turns,
having trouble turning left. We got pretty sore, and called it
quits around 4 pm.

### Mt. Persis Climb, 01/30/2000

I started walking up the snow-covered road at 6:30 (the snow added a 
mile to the journey), and finished with the roads an hour later, 
working up a steep clear-cut. Crampons sped me up a lot on the frozen 
snow. The route follow a long ridge and as the views got better, the 
wind began to howl! Pretty soon, it was blowing me over, and I had to 
crouch and brace against it. I was still 2000 feet below the summit 
and worried about what this kind of wind might mean up there. But I 
developed a strategy (head down, body crabbing sideways) to make it 
bearable. The snow deepened and I changed back to snowshoes, and soon 
came to the false summit at 5200 feet. Looking at the true summit so 
far away was disheartening, but the promised views of Index Peak 
pulled me on. Huge plumes of spindrift were spinning off the summit.



Down to a saddle and slowly up again, I encountered the coolest thing. 
The blowing wind and snow had scrubbed the slope, leaving elevated 
mounds in the shape of a snowshoe. Indeed, the compacted snow under 
the weight of a previous snowshoer had remained, while approx. one 
foot of snow all around had been removed from the slope. By walking on 
these elevated tracks, I didn't sink at all! Awesome, menacing 
patterns of spindrift swirled in the corner of a basin I crossed. I 
wended my happy way through widely spaced snow-covered trees up to the 
summit. YES! The cliffs of Index Peak were frightening, and the 
town of Index and it's walls were far below. Gunn Peak beckoned, and 
I could see Glacier, Three Fingers, Columbia, Baring, Garfield, 
Rainier (being engulfed by clouds), even Stuart. The wind died down, 
and I could hear a police siren down in Gold Bar! These were the 
final hours of a beautiful weather spell: already the Olympics were 
vanishing and high clouds were speeding up from the south. 



I called Kris for a chat (excellent reception), and started down. The 
descend was quick, but I did take one wrong turn. The blowing snow 
had completely covered my tracks in a few places, and once I started 
down a ridge to the northwest, rather than west. Easily fixed though. 
On the north side of my ridge, I saw the exits of many ice-filled colouirs 
that looked perfect for winter ice climbs (when/if I'm ever 
ready for that!). Back on the road, the wind had died, but the blue 
sky had been replaced by gray. As I drove towards Gold Bar, the 
first patterns of rain fell on my windshield...


### Steven's Pass Skiing, 01/29/2000

This time, four intrepid souls got up real early to ski in the day here. This
time Kris and I took a lesson together, and she zoomed down her first
intermediate slopes beautifully! I learned some good stuff too. Kris is getting
the parallel turn down, so watch out!  Roland and Shari improved their
snowboarding with a lesson.  Together, we are getting pretty good! It was cold
though, and the clouds never burned off.


### Snoqualmie Summit Skiing, 01/20/2000

Kris got some new plastic tele boots, so we headed up after work
for some night skiing. We went up and down the green run, fighting
the extreme cold!


### Steven's Pass Skiing, 01/16/2000

Roland, 
Shari, 
Kris and I headed up for some night skiing. Kris took
a lesson, and instantly became an incredible skier! She was showing
me how to get down the steep parts! We can't wait to go again.
Roland and Shari had their new snowboards. This was a super-fun
evening.


### Index Climbing, 01/15/2000

Peter 
and I aid climbed the first part of a wide-crack climb
called the Lizard. We got to place a lot of gear, so this was fun!
Then Peter climbed the 5.0 first pitch of Great Northern Slab with
a mixture of free and aid moves. We had an awesome view of Mt. Index
as the early morning fog dissipated. There was snow on the ground
in Index. We just had the morning, so reluctantly said goodbye at
noon.


### Kendall Knob Skiing, 01/07/2000

I just had a few hours to spare, so headed to the pass to scope out this
favorite ski trail. It climbs a snow-covered road, switch-backing occasionally
with ever-better views of the skiers across the valley along the lifts.
I'd forgotten the duct-tape though, and a blister turned me around before
reaching the Knob. Descent was trying, due to the many, many tracks of
snowshoers, dogs, skiers, and craters where falls had occurred.


### Crystal Mtn Skiing, 01/01/2000

Me and
Kris made some sandwiches and hot cocoa, and repaired with our
tele skis to Crystal Mountain for some turns. We arrived to falling snow
and on/off visibility. The place was empty, and we had plenty of room
to fall in the soft new snow. Kris found the conditions very trying,
but with great strength and determination, she kept going, making it down
an especially long run three times. We both improved a fair bit.
