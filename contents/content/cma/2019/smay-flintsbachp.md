### Flintsbach climbing

_May 18, 2019_

First day it wasn't raining or snowing in like, 2 weeks. Okay that's an exaggeration but
it felt that way! The boys, Barbara and I headed to Flintsbach and did a few routes.
Lenka, Pavel and Igor were climbing there too. A good time! Late lunch at Maxlrain, then
a great session in the playground.
