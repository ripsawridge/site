Jake and I planned to climb Mt. St. Helens today but due to unforeseen
circumstances he had to stay up all night. I was thinking of something
else to do, and I knew that Kris needed the car around noon. The idea
of colouirs on the north side of Lane Peak had me excited, but since
the road to Paradise might not open until some horribly late hour, I
should save that for later. I really wanted to climb Chair Peak, but I
wasn't going to attempt it alone. So, I decided to climb Red Mountain,
which I'd heard has a long steep snow slope that is fun in good
conditions.  (does everyone have such an involved, tedious story about
how they ended up here or there in the wilds?)

Parking at the deserted Summit ski area, I marched up a hard packed
trail in the pre-dawn, alone with my thoughts. It was a little warmer
than I would have liked - there was no frozen crust over the snow, and
the valley was fogged in for the duration of my visit.  I had brought
two ice tools, which was definitely overkill for this climb. Without
being able to see through the fog, I had to chose among diverging
packed trail by intuition.  It was easy following the trail in the
level (and very pretty in the morning) Commonwealth Basin, but I knew
I'd have to climb more steeply to get to the lake below Red
Mountain. I chose a leftward branch, then a right branch. But the
right branch descended then climbed a gully that disappeared into the
fog. I decided to stick with the left branch because it felt
"right." But the tracks were made before the last snowfall, so I had
to begin working for my summit here! I meandered up a steep ridge,
then crossed an avalanche slope to the left, hurrying to the trees on
the other side. Snowshoes were a necessity here. Finally, the tracks
became ski and snowboard descent paths, so I continued up a fairly
open slope peppered with avalanche debris.  I was constantly checking
the stability of the snow, and never found anything to be nervous
about, until near the summit.




Along in here, I still wasn't sure if I was climbing Red Mountain, or
had mistakenly gone too far west to the slopes of Lundin Peak. The
clouds would lift occasionally to reveal a craggy mountain that I
didn't think could be Red. Also, Cave Ridge and Guye Peak looked
really close, and that seemed wrong. It was only as I made my way
slowly higher, and got more distant glimpses, that I knew I was in the
right place. Finally I could see Lundin and the little basin below
it. There were several inches of snow over a firm crust, and as the
slopes topped 40 degrees in angle, I took off my snowshoes and left
them by a tree. It was easier to kick steps, and I connected the tree
"dots" as the ridge became steeper and more defined. My favorite part
of the climb was a 50 degree section that felt very exposed, and when
I had a great view of Lundin and Snoqualmie Peaks. The slopes on
either side of me looked very steep and desolate.  I guess it would
look the same if someone was over there looking at me. Wow...

The wind increased, and lots of snow blew onto the ridge from the
east. I realized this could present an avalanche problem. The slope
was composed of wind-packed snow, apparently brought here by this same
process. It was stable, but I didn't want to linger too long on the
summit. I traversed to avoid some rock outcrops, and soon stood on the
summit in a maelstrom of wind, cloud and snow. The summit has a huge
cornice of snow hanging over the north slopes, and it is important not
to venture onto this.  I got as close as I dared and turned
around. Getting down to an area protected by the wind was almost
comical. My glasses became a hindrance as I carefully down-climbed.
Now facing into the wind, particles of ice and snow would get behind
the lenses and fog them up. I finally took them off. Still, I went by
feel for a while, knowing where I was only by having previous ice ax
placements inches from my face so I could see them. The rest of the
trip down to the snowshoes, then the valley bottom was uneventful,
although the skies cleared further. There was a good view of the
slopes of Kendall Mountain.  On the way back down the valley, I spied
a great looking ice climb, not yet fully formed, and still running
water. It was protected by the usual avalanche danger, as evidenced by
broken chunks at the base of the climb. I said hello to many
snowshoers out with their dogs, and marveled at the crowds on the ski
slopes near the car.



This is a very enjoyable climb, but don't bother going in unless you
are pretty sure snow conditions are good. Even with good snow, there
is plenty of uncertainty about avalanche danger on this mountain.
