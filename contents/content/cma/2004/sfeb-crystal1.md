### Crystal Mountain Skiing, Feb 1, 2004

Robert, Josh and I went skiing (snowboarding for Robert). It was
great. I did some more black diamond runs, and Josh taught me about
skiing down the fall line more aggressively. I think I got the message
near the end of the day, and am excited to work on it more. I added it
up, we descended over 12,000 feet and skied 10 miles!  That is really
neat to be able to cover so much ground. We saw Bob and Mardi in a
freak meeting. We also saw Mark Haley, which was awesome. Aidan was
off shredding the backcountry or somethin'.
