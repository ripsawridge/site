Tired from the day before, I climbed an incredibly steep road near a place called the
Kastensteinerwand Alm. Then it became a steep trail, made more interesting by
wet, heavy snow and water just like the day before. Wearing these big mountain boots
and lugging snowshoes in my pack is a kind of hard life, especially so today because
everyone on the trail was wearing trail running shoes. I hate the way the soles of
my boots will slip so easily on wet roots -- trail runners are just way better about
that somehow. But anyway, I was the big slowpoke, and got used to finding a good place
off to the side of the trail to let the people pass going up and going down.
