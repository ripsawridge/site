Interesting visit to the abbey above the town on the hillside. I prayed
a bit in the church, then wandered back into the cold, cold valley floor
of the Tinnebach. Thence up and back around towards the sun by an old
mine, and out into the sun on the road down to Villanders, where I looked
in vain for a restaurant. Galumpfed thence down to Klausen and a
early dinner in a good pizzeria. About 1100 meters up and down.
