The morning after our [big adventure in the Wilder Kaiser](totenkirchl.html) we
were tired and dehydrated. It looked like the day would be another scorcher
in Austria so we decided to abandon plans of another big climb there and
head on down to the Dolomites. A rest day was essential! We hiked down
to the car, then took a bath in the freezing cold Kaisertalbach. I only
did it because Jesse did. Painful...but eventually quite refreshing. On
the way down to Cortina we hydrated and got a pizza lunch in a deserted
Bressanone. Gelato too, of course.
  
  
In Cortina we found a pension on the road heading north, about 10 minutes
walk from downtown. I think it was 30 euros a night. During our stay we
piggybacked wifi off some neighbors. This was extremely handy as we tried
to figure out some rather unsettled weather. It was raining when we arrived.
  
  
On the whole, our weather forecasts for the week were not great. Usually
the day would start out clear but rain or thundershowers would always come
later. This left us unwilling to hop on anything really big. The next day
(Monday) was forecast to be clear until mid or late afternoon. We figured
that would give us enough time to knock off the classic First Pillar of
Tofana di Rozes. "Klein aber fein," is the German expression for this route
(small but nice): 14 pitches to grade V+ (about 5.8 on the Yosemite scale).
The year before I had climbed the ridge of the bigger Second Pillar, but
this was on the todo list for a long time.

We got some take out pizza and watched the soccer final on tv. Jesse succeeded
in pushing our start time back to 5 am. I, a picture of paranoia, wanted
to get started an hour earlier. Without risk of spoiling the story, I can
say it worked out exactly perfect. We fell asleep before the overtime minutes
were done (ha!).
  
  
The hike in the morning just took at hour. We had double ropes and a moderate
sized rack with us. Jesse started up the rather dark and dubious looking
first pitch. By the next pitch, amorphous features harded into a dihedral
that offered nice and sustained climbing. Pitch three was the supposed
crux at V+, and it was fairly stout. Jesse crabbed up to an overhang in
the dihedral and scooted around with some lieback and hand jamming moves.
A raft of dubious pitons protected the moves, but I believe he got a good
\#2.5 Friend in somewhere in there. Two more unremarkable pitches got us
to the crest, then exposed easy moves right on the crest led to a horizontal
traverse onto the east face. The views from this point became incredible,
enhanced by sun and blue sky.

Some more traversing and moderate climbing on the east side of the ridge
crest got us to a rubble-strewn terrace. On the second pitch we had seen
a guide and a client come up and get started on the first pitch. Now we
realized they had definitely bailed. A few clouds were gathering.
  
  
The next pitch was fairly exciting, being quite polished for some reason.
I had to negotiate a kind of stalactite hanging down over the crack I followed.
It pushed me out into some lieback moves until I could squeeze back into
the now-wider crack...kind of a chimney at this point. I enjoyed that pitch!
  
  
Some more pitches followed, though our attention was consumed by deteriorating
weather. Jesse had an interesting pitch near the end when the clouds descended
and the wind picked up. While he negotiated a short overhang with big holds
and slabs above, I felt a few raindrops. He felt them too, and was in a
hurry! Another long pitch got us to the end of the route, right below the
summit of the massive buttress. Happily, the weather improved again, with
the sun coming back out.

We enjoyed the walk down, admiring the ruins of an old hut and various
war ammo dumps and gun emplacements. It started to rain as we approached
the car, and suddenly let loose with a fury as we entered the Dibona Hut
for some lunch. We'd timed everything perfectly! A big plate of spaghetti
and some beer cheered us up. It was still early afternoon, and we were
happy to have made it down in time! The guide and his client spoke to us,
I guess they bailed because of worries over the weather. Jesse had me in
stitches because he noticed that the guide's van had a massive full color
photo of himself climbing photogenically on it...long hair wafting in the
breeze.
