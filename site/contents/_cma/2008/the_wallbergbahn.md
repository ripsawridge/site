On the first weekend Mom came, I took her and the boys to Tegernsee, where
we rode the Wallbergbahn up that mountain to a restaurant. It was Sunday
morning, and there is a beautiful little chapel up there:

There was a church service going on! Somber horns were playing, and the
priest and all the listeners were standing outside. We went up close to
listen a while. Both boys were very quiet. It was a neat place. We sat
and looked out at the Tegernsee and the neat plains of green stretching
away to the north. Here are some more pictures:
