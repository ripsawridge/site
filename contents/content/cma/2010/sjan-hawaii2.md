### Pu'u Ohulehule
<b>January, 2010</b>

Since reading about the Danish girls lost for 8 days on this mountain I wanted
to climb it. A muddy bash up the Kahana Valley, fording several streams, then
2000 feet of climbing up a steep muddy ridge with in-situ ropes brought me to
the summit. The view was marred a bit because morning clouds hadn't dissipated
the way I'd hoped. But I could see the bay and Chinamans Hat. Slick mud on the
descent required caution. 5 hours round trip.
