<h2>Northeast Arete (5.5)</h2>
<h3>August, 2003</h3>

<h3>Robert Meshew, Mark Pratt, Michael Stanton</h3>


The three of us drove to Roger's Pass, and went into a park service
building. Conditions on the Arete promised to be very good. We made
the mistake of browsing some pages about a new rappel line on the
lower portion of the route. It looked kind of complicated after the
initial rappels, but the shop was closing and we weren't worried about it.


Many camp sites were full, but we finally found an overflow campground.
Settling in for a bivy on the dirt (not quite as nice as the luxury we
were used to in the Kain Hut), we sorted our gear and went to sleep.
We got up around 3 am the next morning, with our packs already prepared.
Robert and I hiked up the dark trail while Mark did something back at
the car. We knew the Sentinel would soon catch up! He caught us as
the weak light of dawn made it just possible to see without lamps.
We'd climbed out of a forest pretty quickly, and were now traversing
a hillside with bridges over raging creeks.

Somehow I was setting the pace up the increasingly steep trail. I felt
pretty good about that, until Mark and Robert managed to get in front of
me! Now I continued along behind, wheezing painfully. Had I learned nothing?
Oh well, I may not be fast, but at least I'm well...comfortable with
being grungy? Anyway, the trail was ridiculously steep and I tried to
lose myself in the increasing view of peaks across the valley. The air
was hazy with smoke, and the smell of burning seemed dangerously close.


We climbed aboard a very distinct moraine with a trail on the crest,
and gradually traversed under the peak to the northeast ridge.
After 4000 feet or so of non-stop hiking, I wanted a rest at the col.
But Mark already took off, and Robert was itching to go too.
We had decided to solo the route, but bring a rope and some gear for
the descent or any problems. The climb is "specimen 4th class," but
definitely has some 5th class moves getting over short steep walls.
The exposure is really incredible too.


There were two other parties. A guide and his client, who traveled
pretty fast. Also, a pair of older guys who were pitching the whole route
out with fixed belays. That method didn't work for them, and they turned around
about halfway up. I think soloing or simulclimbing with belays at cruxes
only may be a better way to go.

By the time I started, I was pretty far behind Mark and Robert. Eventually
I asked Robert to wait for me, because I made a few route-finding mistakes
that slowed me down. If I could keep him near the horizon,
that would avoid costly detours.


Early on, the route was steep and loose. After a few hundred feet, it became
possible to stay just on the right side of the crest, where very solid
quartzite rock made up in solidness what it charged in steepness and 
exposure. There was huge air beneath my feet. 


Gradually I recovered from being wasted on the approach, and started to
enjoy the climbing. I caught up to Robert, and passed him when he changed
some film or just stopped to stare at the M. C. Escher-like views of ridges
and faces. These long routes are amazingly fun when you get into the zone
of movement. I was only semi-conscious of the choices I was making.
I just felt the pleasant exertion of synchronized movement, and enjoyed
the contrast of sun on the left of the ridge and cold air on the right.


A few times I'd see Mark up ahead on some steep ground and wonder how to
surmount it. But I'd just swim up to the rock step and soon be standing on
top, enjoying watching Robert climb along like a copy of myself.
It seemed to go on for hours. There were 2500 vertical feet to climb.


Suddenly there was no more up to go, and I walked to the summit to exchange
a greeting with the Sentinel. Robert appeared, and we marvelled at
the continental views of glaciers and broad valleys. I remember yawning
and eating a sandwich contentedly.

We started down. Robert and I had decided to rope up and simul-climb, while
Mark (characteristically) descended solo. Robert and I took turns for many
long leads down. Finally we reached the rappel anchors on the lower third
of the route. These anchors take you off of the ridge and onto a slabby
face. We were kind of tired, so opted to make those rappels. We made
five of them. Annoyingly, I had a hard time seeing the next anchors, and
wasted minutes looking for them.
We reached a scrambling section, and started looking for the next rappel
anchor. This time, neither of us could find it. We scrambled up and down
a 200 foot section of the face, unable to see a safe way to climb down
further. We were both pretty tired. Robert realized our only choice was
to try and traverse back to the ridge crest 400 feet lower than where we
had left it. Unroped, we crossed several ribs on a stressful traverse
of the face. "This sucks," I remember thinking. A few loose blocks and
a sketchy move under an overhang added to the sense of seriousness and
insecurity. Finally, we made it back to the crest. Robert displayed
great leadership in knowing the unpleasant work we had to do and 
going for it.


Back on the ridge crest I sort of collapsed from the strain. I was just
plain tired of living with such exposure, and the lower 400 feet of the route
had plenty to keep me worried. It was loose yet steep, and kind of devious
because we didn't stay on the crest coming up this section. Robert also
wanted off, and took off far ahead. I got to where I didn't
trust myself to go without making a mistake. So I started rappelling:
a really slow, almost futile process. Every rappel would tangle, and I'd
only get about 30-40 feet with each one. Then I'd have to walk or
downclimb a ways, coiling the rope each time if I didn't want it to
tangle badly. I knew the guys might be worried about me at the col, but
I couldn't safely go any faster.

After 3-4 rappels, I realized I could be there all night with that style,
and I had to start downclimbing in earnest. I'd gotten some mental rest with
the process, and was ready to face the steep descent again. One especially
steep section is imprinted in my brain. There were some committing moves
where I had to trust some suspect blocks as hand or footholds. In one case,
the trust was misplaced, and I caught myself as a foothold tumbled away.
That gave me more focus and energy somehow, maybe a little bit of anger.
I arrived at the col to a visibly relieved Robert and Mark. Robert said
he'd had a close call too. Mark had spent a couple of hours waiting
for us (he didn't make the costly rappelling detour).


A lesson? It's a long, exposed, committing route. It's possible to get
mentally tired of the exposure, something I hadn't really experienced before.
Probably best to stick together, because that way you don't have to
independently chose the ascent/descent, and can mentally draft on your 
partner a little bit, taking turns on the sharp end of decision making.


We hiked down, me thinking my own thoughts about the 
route, and things I'd learned. We descended to the
valley, reaching the forest in hot late afternoon. I brought up the rear
as usual, eavesdropping on a comical camera crew getting footage for
a nature show. We zoomed away from the mountain, making some miles
on the long drive home.


We got a motel room in a small town. I was too tired to take a shower, but
just crashed immediately. The next day, we continued west under Yak Peak,
then crossed the border back into the U.S. It was great to be home and
see Kris! We had a great evening and day together before the next trip
into the mountains. But that is another story...


Special thanks to Mark and Robert. They are some great guys to climb with.
Oh I forgot to mention something funny. Robert tends to liken situations
we might come across to "a tragedy of the commons." And Mark says "you think
everything is a tragedy of the commons!" And then they'll argue about
a Malthusian crises or maybe the Dining Philosophers problem or something
equally interesting! Capital fellows...
