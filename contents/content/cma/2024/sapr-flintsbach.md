Time to try out some rope soloing! I led "Frauenschuhe" (5+) with my solo
setup, then top-roped it 2 more times. Then I led "Kinderleicht" (6-) and
top-roped that twice. Then I went around to the Steinbruch sector and
admired the fresh rockfall, apparently from earlier in the month. But
I could still climb the first pitch of "Normalweg" (probably rated
4), then did a top rope of the first pitch of "Kombination" (6-) and
traversed left to the anchor. 8 nice pitches on a fine, windy evening.
