### Attempt on a peak
_August, 2008_

Dan P. and I tried to climb a nice route on a Wilder Kaiser peak. We got
hopelessly lost. First mis-identifying the start of the route, leading us to
climb 4 pitches of chossy no-mans land. Hilariously, we emerged on a trail at
the top of this. "Oh, okay...it must be over here."

Then we found the start of the route, and I, idiotically, led us into
sparse/blank terrain, finally belaying at ropes end from two Camelots. Dan
traversed a pitch over to the proper route. Now we had two bolted pitches on
middle-quality rock...definitely not the Wilder Kaiser I'd been raving to Dan
about. But finally we were below the hard pitches and the fun could begin. Oh.
But it looks like it might rain. Plus it's late now. Fine.

We descend.

I guess you need days like this to enjoy the good ones?
