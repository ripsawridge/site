Today was the first day of Kindergarten, hooray!
  
  
Boy, I was scared. I woke up at 6 this morning suddenly in a cold sweat,
imagining that if I were in my kids shoes, plopped into a room full of
kids who don't speak my language...that I might be pretty mad. And mad
2 year olds make for good tantrums!
  
  
So we were extra good, I made eggs for breakfast and let the boys crack
the eggs open which they love to do. They got to choose their shirts and
pants from a pre-arranged selection Kris had laid out the night before.
We walked there just as it started to rain. Seriously it is freezing cold
in Germany right now.

We met Sara at the Kinderhaus, and the boys took off jackets and shoes,
placing them in their own boxes for storage. We went upstairs and the boys
started getting familiar with the place. There was plenty for them to do.
A wooden train set, a typewriter, a telephone, little wooden and metal
puzzles.
  
  
We all sat in a circle, called to it by a beautiful little Tibetan gong
the teacher had. She introduced Elijah and Rowan, who meanwhile were trying
to escape the circle, apparently bored out of their minds by the polite
attention on them. I had to say their names while Kris tackled Elijah and
I held Rowan by his shirt collar. Boy was this embarrassing! Harkening
back to my cold sweat dream of the morning I thought we'd be kicked out
within the week for such shockingly bad behavior.
  
  
The teacher dismissed us, sending us all outside in the rain and hail
to play. "Uh...okay" we said. Kris bundled Elijah up while I changed Rowan's
diaper, which attracted a small audience of 10-12 kids. He seemed impressed
by the child-sized toilets in the bathroom. "Maybe soon you'll start using
those!" I enthused.
  
  
But we went outside and the kids loved a treehouse (Baumhaus) and slide
(Rutschen)...and swing set (Schaukeln). Jeez, doing all this in German
is hard. Rowan didn't seem to mind my panicked/confused look. It's similar
to my resting/default look.
  
  
So we played out there for 2 hours, imbibing the painfully cold "frische
luft" (fresh air for the german-challenged). The kids were dirty and generally
happy. When it was lunchtime, I quietly snuck out, leaving Kris to supervise
them at the table. After that they went home where the kids napped well.
Kris mentioned some weird events like Elijah getting everybody in the room
to shake their heads, but she'll have to explain that later.
  
  
"selbstst√§ndig" is a new word I learned. It describes Elijah and means
roughly stubborn and independent. Not a word I'll soon forget!
