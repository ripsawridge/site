### Markt Schwaben
_November, 2016_

I decided to make the 27 kilometer (~17 miles) walk out to Markt Schwaben.
What an adventure...I'm back home now, my feet are so sore! From my apartment,
it's amazing how it's just a straight line going east to get there. I used
walking paths as much as possible, but wow...there are a lotta streets.

I remember a few special moments: the end of the six-story buildings that
separate "city" from the rest...that happened by the freeway. I remember the
first time there was an open field (not too long after). I remember the
first time I felt sun on me, and much later, when I could take off gloves.
The countryside is mostly populated by women and their dogs. I see how good
dogs are for people, in that they simply make them get up and go out on the
land.

But the land was pretty empty, too. Scuds of cloud to the south, and glimpses
of mountains. Dry grass was inviting to sit on for it's scarcity.

### Roßkogel and Weißstein
_July 21, 2016_

I hiked up from road far below, avoiding the toll road. I think it was
the Tieftalbach. The steep descent down the west side of the
Weißstein was especially interesting. I was hoping to reach the
Pieder Spitze, but in the never ending ups and downs of the Koflerspitzen,
realizing I had to reverse the whole route, I decided to turn back.
This time I followed the south and then east ridge descent of the
Roßkogel to the summit called Köegele. 

A most interesting day. 1850 meters up and down. Here are a few pics...

### Schafreuter
_June 26, 2016_

Barbara and I hiked up Schafreuter in light rain and mist. We had a fantastic
time, especially at the summit. We got some coffee, too.

### Heimgarten
_June 23, 2016_

Toon, Camillo and I hiked up the peak before work, what a fun time!

### Buchstein Hiking
_June 18, 2016_

Me and Rowan tried to hike up Buchstein, but it was raining hard after a while.
We were content to reach the high grassland with the peak visible.

### Hiking near Trauenstein
_May, 2016_

A whole bunch of us went to a hike above Trauenstein.
It might have been Strohn-Schneid? Oh well, it was in that area.

### Heuberg
_April 30, 2016_

Barbara and I hiked up Heuberg today, passing by a couple of empty huts.
We enjoyed the day tremendously.
