* Southwest Ridge (5.7)
* August 8, 2000

Steve had picked out the Southwest Ridge, a historic climb with 6 or 7
pitches of 5.7 climbing.  The climb was guarded by a long approach up
a brushy slope with a prominent snowfield at the midpoint. Jeff
suggested we take the 7 am boat, and if we hurried, we could make it
back for the last boat at 6 pm. We did this, getting on the Jenny Lake
shuttle with a gaggle of climbers making for other routes in the area,
such as Cube Point, Baxter's Pinnacle and the Guide's Wall. Happily,
we were alone in our choice of destination. We easily climbed out of
the forest into a brushy talus field. Here, a short 4th class climb
got us above a headwall, and onto a small trail traversing onto the
desired slope above a cliff band.  We were puzzled as we connected
with the creek there, noticing a large, well-trodden trail coming to
meet us from the edge of the cliff band. Huh? We resolved to follow it
down later. The view was great, and the rocky gully we ascended wasn't
as bad as it looked from the boat. Finally, we spotted a cairn, and
exited the gully on the right, eventually losing all traces of
trail. We sidehilled up dirty slopes, enjoying the occasional level
boulder. Finally, just below a notch dividing Storm Point from
Symmetry Spire, we turned right and easily found the base of the
route.

We rested, roped up, and scrambled up to the first belay.  I had to
climb back down to my pack three times, once for water, once for the
route topo, and once just to maximize wasted time! The first lead was
easy, and the rock solid. It led to a tiny notch below a steep
headwall with a beautiful short crack. I built an anchor here, and
Steve followed. This whole climb was full of fixed Camelots, shoved
with great earnestness as deep into cracks as possible. Often, my
anchors made handy use of these impromptu, albeit bomber, pieces. The
next lead had a hard start on the short crack, but it was great
fun. Moving up on the ridge, we got to enjoy increasing views of the
lake, Mt. Owen and Mt. Teewinot. A few birds flitted above and below.


The next two pitches weren't very memorable, but the final two pitches
were spectacular.  Each of them is often done as two pitches each, but
with our 60 meter rope, we had no problem combining. First we
encountered "The Nose," with a few stiff 5.7 moves protected by
ancient iron pitons. It was a sandy, Gandalfian nose about 20 feet
high. Great fun with careful foot placements. The harder move of the
pitch was getting to a big ledge, and continuing on black, steep,
blocky rocks above. The exposure here was great, and Steve looked very
tiny directly below. A strenuous move got me onto the rock, then
delicate work avoided the overhangs and piles of loose rock. Finally,
practically out of gear, a face climb that reminded me of the upper
Castle in Tumwater Canyon led to a large ledge. I was happy for a
single fixed pin on that face. Steve loved that pitch, and we were
both raving about the joy of this climb now. The final pitch looked
intimidating, but a 5.6 ramp led up and right to a belay
ledge. Continuing on, I reached "The Flake", a large granite
envelope, which I licked on the left side, finishing with a hand
traverse and a mantel. We smiled at the world below, and did some
roped and unroped scrambling to a notch below the true summit.



We had expected to go on to the summit via scrambling, but the many
rappel slings here, and the steep, loose wall above convinced us to
rappel. A man appeared at a saddle below, and verified that our single
rope reached the bottom. After more scrambling, we reached a notch,
and talked with the local man there. He was very nice, although he
warned us that because we were "tourists," some locals (not him of
course) might have said the ropes REACHED, when they DIDN'T. If you
get his meaning. We said our goodbyes, sadly aware of people again,
and their various foibles. The loose gully went well, and once we
reached our packs, we got some resolve to make the last boat. This
time, we followed a wide trail down. It was just above the gully we
climbed up, and much better as a descent. We followed it over the
cliffy headwall, finding it angled left, cleverly staying above the
steep bits. Finally, we came to our 4th class climb from the morning,
finding that's where we'd made a wrong turn.  (near the top of the
climb, make a sharp LEFT, don't go STRAIGHT AHEAD into a shallow gully
like normal people).



We ran willy-nilly for a while, then pounded pell-mell down the trail,
reaching the boat dock at 5:45. Sadly, we found a welter of screaming
children and huffing tourists waiting in a quarter-mile-long
line. Against our better instincts (we'd worked so hard for that
boat), we got in line, shuffling aboard sometime after 7:00. So this
was where all the people were!
