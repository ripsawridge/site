Barbara and I climbined
["Sommer, Sonne, Sonnenschein,"](https://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/bayern/berchtesgadener-alpen/sommer-sonne-sonnenschein-hohes-brett)
which we'd [done before in 2017](../2017/berchtesgaden.html). It would be my first multipitch climb
since the accident in 2020, and her first outdoor climb in just as long.
Were we up for it? Barbara thought I might find climbing difficult or
stressful. The truth was that it was easy and relaxed and fun.
However, the overall exertion of the day, and especially the scree-filled
deescent tired us both out.

We each had favorite pitches on the climb. Mine was the steep 4th pitch,
exiting a gully system for a face (IV), and hers was very fine -- the
"Tolle Rillenplatte," sustained and sharp for 45 meters (IV).

Notable events included a gathering of farmers bringing their cows down,
who really wanted us to stand around for many minutes while they wrestled
the cows in the area we had to pass through. We finally ignored their
demands and just walked around the whole scene. I'm sure they are very
conservative because hikers don't understand animals and tragic events
have taken place. But a wide berth solves many problems.

On the way down, we were so thirsty! Finally we got water near the base
of the mountain. We had a nice discussion with a couple coming off an
adjacent route, that made part of the descent more pleasant.

Barbara was keen to not use hiking poles on the tricky descent. She really
did improve her skills!

Here we are somewhere in the lower pitches:

Poor one, she was extremely tired!

Again...and thirsty!
