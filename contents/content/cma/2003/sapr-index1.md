<h3>Index Climbing, April 1, 2003</h3>

As befitted April Fool's Day, three Fools left work a bit early and
drove out to Index. Kris and Theron were excited to climb Pisces,
a great 5.6 hand crack. We arrived in the rain, but continued up
anyway. As it became dark quickly, Kris sacrificed her position on
the rope after the first pitch to let Theron follow me on Pisces.
He did really well, and after making rappels in the dark, our team
repaired to a dinner in the beautiful Taco Bell dining room.
