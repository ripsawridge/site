A very cold day (-16!). We were up and down in 4 hours.
Josef had an idea to go around to the Hochplatte via two intermediate
descents. It sounded tiring, though it might have been great!
Somehow intermediate descents tire me out, a definite psychological
weakness I should work on!

Josef and Kyril wisely saw that the summit was dangerous to climb without
crampons and ice axe. I tried it, but turned around after 50 meters because
the climbing was dicey, and the fall zone was unforgiving. Kyril and Josef
waited in the sun, and I was happy to rejoin them.
We had a bit of fun going down, but the logging road was really icy and
not incredibly fun. Still, first ski tour of the year, and a nice time!
4 hours round trip.
