### Tiger Mountain, May ?, 2005

Nathan and I went for a fun trailrun Sunday morning. We hiked the cableline
trail up, then tagged the three west summits, enjoying a fun run down
past Poo Poo Point. We were briefly lost once on the flats in a hard rain,
but eventually made the car. A great time!
