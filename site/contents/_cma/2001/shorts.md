### Alpental Parking Lot, 12/21/2001}

Alex, Peter, Kim and I snowshoed from the parking lot towards Source Lake. We
came back shortly before the lake, and practiced ice climbing on the parking lot
walls. Pretty fun!


### Mt. Catherine, 12/16/2001}

I returned on skis two days later. It was pouring rain, but I was
there, so I decided to skin up along roads and ski runs to the right
of our previous route. First I skied up and down the kiddie lift to
try and get back in practice. I'm a terrible skier! Anyway, I
continued up, finally reaching "Grand Junction." I went into the hut,
soaking wet, and decided the best way to get warm was to go home!
Skiing down was exciting and quick! Rain, rain, rain...


### Mt. Catherine, 12/14/2001}

Peter and I tried to hike up Mt. Catherine at Snoqualmie Pass. Deep,
powdery snow slowed our progress.  We broke trail up a Hyak ski lift,
then went down steep slopes on the other side in incredible wind and
spindrift. I thought we were on Mt. Washington in New Hampshire for a
moment! We crossed a creek and climbed 500 feet up slopes on the
shoulder of the mountain. With avalanche danger pretty high, we didn't
want to get on anything steep, so we turned around. For fun, we built
a snow shelter in a tree well. As we snowshoed down, the sun came out
and the air was crystal clear.


### Mailbox Peak, 12/7/2001}

Peter and I squelched up the muddy trail early this morning. But the
stars and moon were out - did we make the Friday weather window? First
time on this very steep trail which reminded us of the steep, forested
Eldorado Creek trail. Encountered snow, finally wanting snowshoes near
the crest of the long slope from the ground. Still, deep snow made the
trudge to the boulder-field difficult, but then a frozen crust made
life easier getting to the summit. We chanted from Green Eggs and Ham,
knocking a foot-wide sheet of rime ice off the mailbox to get in. Even
blades of grass were plastered with thick carapaces of ice - must have
been ugly up here! Crisp, clear air, with views to Rainier and
Baker. Even the Haystack was plastered in white. Good snow brought us
down in 1.5 hours, no other souls.  

### Granite Mountain hike, 11/9/2001}

Peter, Alex and I got an early morning start for a before work hike. We had a
few problems, including a alarm clock mishap, a closed exit ramp, a pre-dawn
traffic jam. But once past this, we were walking happily on the
trail. Discussing various things, we got our exercise and marched up the
slope. Coming to a broad gully, we opted to travel straight up the winter route,
using game trails and big slabby boulders for progress. Wir spricht nur
Deutsch. *"Pytor! Wir sind fast hoehe, fast da!"* said Alex.  Gaining the
ridge crest, we found several feet of snow. Peter and I took the bouldery crest,
Alex dropped into a basin and up another way. Standing on the lookout tower, we
admired the sunny views of Rainier, Garfield and Kaleetan. The way down felt
long, but it was a fun morning.


### McClellan's Butte hike, 10/28/2001}

Trying out my new Black Diamond Ice Pack (I love this thing), I hiked
up McClellan's Butte, a really pretty summit on the I-90 corridor. The
trail is good, but annoyingly, crosses three roads. I listened to the
radio as the steep trail led into increasing snow. I followed day-old
tracks to Windy Corner, where a bone-chilling wind accompanied the
view to Chester Morris Lake. From here, snow depth increased, and
became about 15 inches deep after the frozen pond. The summit block
was tricky, because of snow and ice over the rocks. But the sky was
blue, streaked with white.  The view from this pointy summit stretched
from Mt. Rainier up to Mt. Baker, with many craggy peaks in
between. This was my second trip up there.


### Frenchman's Coulee Climbing, 10/21/2001}

Chris K., Jeff Witt, Peter, Kim and I arrived at the Feathers in spitting
rain. We did several routes here: the steep 5.8 (which now has graffiti on it,
damn!), all the easy routes, even a chopped 5.9 route on top-rope, done after
Chris and I climbed a "unknown" corner we'd rate about 5.7. I climbed another
"unknown" route at 5.4, loose.  Then Peter and I climbed the north side of
Agaltha Tower in two exciting pitches.  There were some fun 5.7 moves near the
top on a steep red wall. Then the sun came out, so we went to the Sunshine
Wall. I followed on Tangled up in Blue, a difficult (for me) 5.9 crack. Then had
a slightly easier time on George and Martha (5.10a), a really exciting route. I
fell on the off-width near the top, then got it right.  Chris and I finished at
dusk on Throbbing Gristle, a bolted 5.9 arete.  Kim climbed 7 Virgins and a Mule
for the first time.  A really nice time for us all.


### Index Climbing, 9/22/2001}

Peter, Kris and I planned to climb at Static Point, but on discovering that the
road was closed due to potential terror attacks on the reservoir, we diverted
our plans to Index. Peter has never climbed Great Northern Slab, so the three of
us did this.  Peter also got in a top-rope of the excellent 5.6 hand crack on
Pisces. There was a famous female climber sharing our belay, but I forgot her
name. Fun, relaxing afternoon.

### Exit 38, 9/02/2001} 
Kris and I went for a fun afternoon of
climbing here. We did several routes around the trestle/we-did-rock
area. Kris climbed the 5.9 route on We-Did-Rock, big congratulations to
her! We enjoyed the evening when the place emptied out.


### Leavenworth, 7/28/2001}

Kris and I took my sister Tamara for her first rock climbing outside. We went to
Mountaineer's Buttress and climbed three fun pitches. Tamara did really well,
only finding the second pitch a little harder than she would have liked. I made
a point of leaving cams at home and bringing hexes, which proved to be very
trustworthy (I've avoided hexes until now). We had dinner at a German food
restuarant with our friend Christos, who just happened to be strolling by.

### Static Point, 7/21/2001}

I had to introduce Kris to granite slab climbing, so I dragged her up the trail
 to the rock.  We met a really nice dog named Pete, who needed rescuing from a
 high ledge he had scrambled to. He was so happy to be back on solid
 ground. Kris did a great job, but three pitches were enough for us today. We
 climbed Offline, and I was once again amazed at the runouts required to do this
 climb!  This was a fun afternoon trip.

### Lake Serene, 7/14/2001}

Fresh back from Italy, I had lots of energy to do something. I took a
few hours in the middle of the day to visit the lake, and I wanted to
try the old trail. I found it pretty quickly, it is just up from the
upper falls lookout. It is a boot beaten path that goes steeply up (no
switchbacks), using tree roots for aid. I don't think I saved much
time on the way up, as I had to work to keep the trail sometimes, but
on the way down, I made it from the lake to the falls in 20 minutes!
It was a long controlled fall...I also scoped out the approach for a
climb I'd like to do here.


### Great Northern Slab, 6/21/2001}

Kris and I brought my Mom to Index to see what climbing is about. I actually let
her belay me on the short first pitch of Libra Crack, a 5.8 offwidth that gets
tricky at the end.  Then Kris and I did the usual three pitches of the slab,
just to practice for Italy.

### Leavenworth Climbing, 6/9-10/2001} 

Kris, Kim, Peter and I drove out and got on the R & D Route. We had a good
time, but had to work through considerable crowding on the route. There was
quite a bottleneck, and one party had cut the second pitch in half. We were able
to pass them there. Kris had a hard time on the last pitch because she fell
right off the belay and felt a little sketched after that. We had a great dinner
and a visit to the motel hot tub. The next day, Peter and I top-roped April
Mayhem (5.9), and I climbed it easily. This was great because previous attempts
had spit me off. Peter found the crack pretty hard, but easily climbed the upper
thin face. Then we started hiking to Bean Creek Basin, but Kim injured her knee
at a creek crossing. We were happy to get back to the trailhead with no
problems! She is recovering quickly. Then Kris and I hiked up Little Si. Kris
amazed me by hiking with great speed and confidence, I was impressed! I took the
scramble variation directly above the first climbing area. This is a great
scramble with some exposed 4th class climbing mixed with very steep trail. Car
to car was 2:15, a new record for Kris.


### Mount Pilchuck 06/07/2001}

We got home at about 10:00 pm, and I had this urge to hike, so I took
off for the granite slopes of Mount Pilchuck. I knew it would be a
clear night, and there was a moon, so it was an ideal time. I
encountered snow at the boulderfield and had a great time looking at
the lights of the city below. I was on top at 12:30 am, taking an hour
and 15 minutes up. The lookout door was open, so I remembered to close
it when I left. What a cool museum they have in there.  Thanks to the
Everett Mountaineers for that. Many fun standing glissades in the
moonlight on the way down. And hey, I was home by 2:30 am!


### Ingall's Creek 05/27/2001}

Kris and I hiked about 6 miles up Ingall's Creek. We aren't sure if we passed
 "Falls Creek Camp," or came close to it, as that was our turnaround
 location. We had high clouds to keep the temperature down. This was a great
 hike, although Kris got a blister :(.


### Teanaway Ridge/Iron Bear, 05/26/2001}

Kris and I
 enjoyed this hike despite extreme heat in the middle of the
day. Excellent views of Mt. Stuart and ridges leading to it.

### Smith Rocks, 05/19-20/2001}

Kris and I got a *very* late start for the drive on Saturday, and only climbed 2
pitches of Super Slab that evening. The next day Steve and I climbed Sky Ridge,
a beautiful climb. Then Steve, Sarah, Kris and I climbed Cinnamon Slab. After
this we hiked around, and headed home. A fun trip despite the small amount of
climbing!

### Snow Creek Wall, Orbit, 05/12/2001}

Steve and I did this excellent climb. We were behind another Steve and his
friend, and it was kind of awkward because they offered to let us pass, but for
some reason we didn't. Then later, I was feeling pretty dehydrated sitting at a
belay, so I asked if we could take them up on the offer. They obliged, but
unfortunately, it was at an awkward location, just after the crux pitch. I
hadn't led that pitch before, and it took longer than I thought. So I think we
made them wait for us for 20 minutes. Sorry about that guys! I led all the
pitches so Steve could see what a 5.8 trad route like this was like. The crack
pitch was harder than when I followed Dan a few weeks before! Steve (from 2nd
party) very kindly sent me a few slides.

### Little Si (Kris), 05/13/2001} 

She had such fun the day before, she did it again. She met some hikers who had
travelled in Italy, and had a great time.

### Little Si (Kris), 05/12/2001}

Kris 
hiked up and met Bob and Brian for an exchange of climbing
shoes. She enjoyed an apple on the summit, and others were envious!

### Static Point: Offline, 05/06/2001}

A surprise call from Alex began this pleasant trip. He and Summer picked me up
at home, and we were off to climb Online (5.10b, 6 pitches) at Static Point, a
hidden granite slab in the Sultan Basin. We walked up the road and turned left
up a boot-beaten trail into a beautiful forest. We hiked about 800 feet up to
the base of the slab. A party of four was climbing Online, and for the next hour
we wavered between climbing Offline and hoping they would hurry. But they had
one leader and climbed one at a time, so that wasn't happening.  Luckily, Alex
brought a rack suited to Offline (5.10a, same length as Online, and 20
feetright), which has more natural protection. He led a loose and dirty first
pitch, then traversed to the second pitch belay anchor of Online (we were still
hopeful). Alex belayed Summer and I up at the same time with the most excellent
Kong Gi-Gi, which allows the two followers to climb together, and the leader to
belay hands free. We wondered what to do, finally deciding to continue
Offline. I climbed a diagonal pitch up easy ramps then to pleasant friction and
the belay.  We swapped leads, making excellent time with double ropes. The views
improved and the climbing got trickier. The runouts between bolts were long, but
nicely the bolts were clustered at difficult sections. Most pitches had two or
three bolts, and one or two cam placements. At the top we admired the
surrounding peaks. Mt. Stickney looked great and Crested Butte was inspiring and
jagged.  The rappels were quick and easy.  As we hiked down,the party of four
were finishing their climb.

### Frenchman's Coulee, 04/29/2001}

![Kris and I](images/articles/trips/2001/mekapvan.jpg)
![On Ride 'em Cowboy](images/articles/trips/2001/ridcow.jpg)

Kris and I, Bob and Brian headed to Vantage, discouraged by rain forecasted for
the Leavenworth area.  Bob drove, and we spent about 30 minutes driving around
Ellensberg for a parking pass. Finally, we got one, which is a good idea,
because you'll get a ticket if you don't. I think it cost $12.  We hiked to the
Sunshine Wall, and I was gunning for a lead of "Ride 'em Cowboy." Not realizing
how tired I was from the previous day in Leavenworth, I got about halfway and
had to hang on the rope when my right arm burned out. I got past this crux, and
came to another shortly below the anchors. Back on the rope. Boy, I felt silly!
Finally, I figured out the moves, and reached the anchor. Not a great start!
Better to get on something easier...

Bob and Brian did this climb, then Brian and I headed over to do a
trad route. Brian wanted to get some practice cleaning gear, and I
thought 7 Virgins and a Mule would be a good lead for him, since it
protects very well. But several people were on the route, and drinking
beer at the belay! We found a route called "Stokin the Chicken," rated
5.6, which had some chimney and crack climbing.  From the belay, the
climbing was easy, but only protected with larger cams. Halfway up, I
had placed three of them, and was getting worried. I moved carefully
to a chockstone, and was able to sling it from an awkward stance. As
soon as I clipped the rope to it I had doubts about it's safety! You
know how Vantage is, with loose rock...Anyway, I manteled onto the
chockstone and considered my options. It looked unprotectable. I could
follow a wide fist crack left, or go into a chimney with blank walls
on the right. I had one 2.5 inch cam left. Stemming out of the
chimney, I climbed up and left on small foot smears, and placed the
cam. A very bad placement, as it was too small. I moved right back
into the chimney to consider my options,and was greeted with a most
welcome sight: a solid finger crack! Yes! I placed a solid nut, went
back out and removed the bad cam at the same level, then moved up the
finger crack.  My back was on the opposite wall of the chimney, and
now began an exhausting thrutch (at least the hands were good in the
crack). Knees abraiding, feet smearing, I wondered how anyone could
think this route was 5.6? I placed a small cam, and was soon near the
exit.  One more piece protected the final moves, and I was above the
chimney in strong wind, crossing to a fixed sling around a column to
belay on. Whew! What a climb...

I belayed Brian up, and it was fun to watch how differently he did
some things. Brian is a really strong climber, and he made do with
crimpy face holds rather than the obvious crack. In the knee grinding
chimney, he faced the other way, reaching back over his shoulder to
clean the pro!  He came up quickly and we rappelled from an anchor on
a different climb. I didn't care too much for the sling draped around
my belay column.

Next was 7 Virgins and a Mule. I led this delightful climb, hauled the
packs, then Brian came up. This way we could walk off from the
rim. Hauling the packs was funny, because I used my belay device and
did this very slowly. Finally, I lost patience and hauled
hand-over-hand, much quicker!  Brian will be ready to lead this route
next time.

Meanwhile, Kris and Bob had climbed at the Feathers, not feeling too
ambitious. Bob was getting over a cold, and Kris was content with some
old favorites. We had a great dinner at a yellow church in Ellensberg.

### Leavenworth Climbing, 04/15/2001}

Kris and I drove to
Leavenworth for some climbing. First we did Martian Diagonal on
Martian Slab at the Peshastin Pinnacles. This route is pretty fun if
friction slabs are your thing. The rating is about 5.5, and we climbed
it as 4 short pitches.  By running the rope out, you might be able to
do it in two, but it was more fun to keep an eye on Kris as she
grappled with the rock. Not used to friction, she found some of it
pretty hard, but I think she's more used to it now. You either get a
little pebble embedded in the rock to grab here, or you get nothing!
The scenery is great on this route.

After this, we ate, then Kris belayed me on Dogleg Crack(5.8+), a
three star crack route in Icicle Canyon. I decided to lead it.  Wow,
it was really, really hard! I actually took my first leader fall on
gear, a trusty orange Metolius cam. Getting established in the crack
was the most difficult part, and the severe rightward lean made
climbing very awkward. I laybacked a section delicately, and finally
got established in the crack. The route eased up for a while, then
there was a difficult transition left, and a short traverse to the
anchors.  I want to go back and work on this climb some more.

We finished the day with a visit to our old friend Mountaineer's
Dome. Everyone had left,and we spent two nice evening hours climbing
three pitches. This was Kris's reward for persevering on some new
terrain at Peshastin! It was really fun for us both, and she hollered
that I was such a liar, because I thought it was only two pitches.  I
prefer to think of it as creative memory retention! :) Both a little
sore, we picked our way down the boulderfields back to the car.

### Little Si, 03/31/2001} 

Kris and I went hiking here in the
late afternoon. First we drove on the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River
Road for a while and saw Mt. Garfield and we looked for the Mailbox
Peak trailhead. Then we did the hike. Kris did an excellent job on the
steep trail for her first hiking in a while, and together we stood on
the summit as evening approached.  I really like scrambling around the
summit rocks, but we had to get going before darkness came. One
section of the forest was alarmingly dark on the way out. We got a
coke and drove home, happy with our exercise.

### Frenchman's Coulee, 03/25/2001} 

Kris and I were taking our enthusiastic friend Christos for some easy outdoor
rockclimbing.  But weather had deteriorated, and Kris decided to stay home
rather than climb in the rain. We reasoned that the dinner plate holds of the
Coulee would be pretty good even if wet, so we took off for the desert. Christos
learned how to belay, climb and lower off at the Feathers on some old standby
routes. I belayed him up on one so we could sit on the ridge crest together. At
this point, rain turned to hail, and we quickly came down. A hike down to the
Columbia River was fun to do. Later, we came back to the rock and I climbed 7
Virgins and a Mule, then we both did Peaceful Warrior.  Just a weekend of easy
old favorites, ah.

### Great Northern Slab, Index, 03/24/2001} 

After spending most
of the day at a European travel seminar, I had a few hours to kill
before darkness. On this so-fine day, I couldn't just stay inside.  I
left a sleepy Kris on the couch and was soon soloing the first pitch
of Great Northern Slab, an old favorite. I set up a belay for the
spectacular twin-crack pitch, then climbed, using a clove-hitch for a
belay. I took the easy way around the awkward start, then climbed the
pitch slowly. It really takes a lot of time to adjust the clove hitch
every two moves, I should have given myself a bit more slack. At the
top, I rappelled the route and reclimbed it, this time doing the
awkward start. What fun in the evening sun! I never saw any other
climbers on the wall. I gazed at Mt. Index as the sun began to set,
then rappelled two pitches and drove home. An excellent 2 hours on the
rock (4:30 - 6:30 pm).


### Alpental Ice Climbing, 03/07/2001} 

Peter and I came back,
needing to get in one more climb of this thing before it fell apart
due to the recent warm temperatures. Peter led up onto the ice,
choosing a leftward traverse into a snow gully coming down from the
anchor.  This steep, rotten snow slope provided some adventure, since
any tool placements were marginal at best. I top-roped the climb, then
moved the anchor 20 feet higher to another tree with a fixed
sling. This gave about 10 more feet of ice climbing. We each climbed
it again, then headed down. We had to trade crampons back and forth
and make due with 2 ice screws since Peter brought Kim's crampons by
mistake! This didn't hamper us a bit though!


### Alpental Ice Climbing, 03/01/2001} 

Steve N. and I had seen
this climb walking back from an attempt on Chair Peak the previous
weekend. It was up to 
Peter and I to sneak back up there before work
Thursday morning. We had seen an *amazing* orange and red sunrise
behind Guye Peak on the drive in. Spirits suitably elevated, I decided
to lead the climb. Taking all our ice screws, I hiked up the snow that
covered the lower part of the climb and placed a screw at the base of
the route. It felt solid so I continued, getting great axe placements
in the ice. Each time I looked down between my legs the previous ice
screw seemed a long ways below. Before a final bulge I rested on a
stubby screw placement. Climbing over this, then around the corner to
rotten and fracturing ice, I soon reached the tree and sling that
marks the end of the pitch. Yes!  Peter did the climb and cleaned
gear, then we each top-roped the climb, taking a somewhat steeper
line.

### Mount Si, 02/02/2001} 

Below-summit bivy, climb attempt in the
morning. Got to the saddle just below the summit in snow and ice. Two
rappels to the base of the haystack.  This really is a fun mixed ice
climb in proper conditions. 
Ray and 
Mike needed to get back to work,
so we left the summit pitch for another time.  Had fun.

### Guye Peak, 01/21/2001} 

Steve, Chris, Peter and I had to do something despite a weather forecast getting
worse by the second! So we bundled up, and headed for Snoqualmie Pass. Our
initial plan was to climb the West Ridge of Lundin Peak, but driving snow and an
all night rain convinced us to try something easier. So we headed for Guye Peak
via Commonwealth Basin. This was a great chance for Chris to meet Steve and
Peter, and they liked him and his Polish accent immensely. As we left the basin
floor for steeper slopes, we heard the booming of mortar shells, used by the ski
area to knock snow off of Cave Ridge. Since we were heading to the backside of
this area, we heard more and more, until it became a little unnerving. Finally,
the ever-eager ski patrol backed off, and we climbed in a steep, silent forest
just beneath the icy slopes of Guye. We had to cross two slopes with avalanche
potential, and we did this hurriedly.  I wondered about the party heading up to
Red Mountain in these conditions. As it turns out, they also had a great climb
(I found this out later on cascadeclimbers.com).  With Chris saying things like
"It would be a piece of shame to turn around now," we reached the saddle
seperating Cave Ridge from Guye Peak. At this very moment, a tremendous "BOOM!!"
rang out, and a telltale puff of smoke appeared in the air, only 300 feet
away. "That must have been a shell," I said.

This would have turned more prudent men around, but we reasoned that a
direct hit would be required to hurt us (understatement) since we were
on a wide ridge-top.  We snowshoed up the ridge, enjoying a short
steep bit, then climbing the summit slopes. Visibility had increased
enough to see from Silver Peak in the south, to much of Snoqualmie
Peak in the north, but Chair and Kendall Peaks brooded behind sullen
clouds. We could see the other two summits of Guye, but they would
have to wait for another trip. Taking a few pictures, we ran and
glissaded to the saddle, then hurried across slopes to the safety of
the forest.  Soon, we tromped onto the trail in the basin, getting
some excitement when Chris and Peter crossed a thin log over the
creek. We squelched to the car, and made for a pizza restaurant in
North Bend with a real fireplace. How awesome to be warm after a
morning of cold and damp! We were home early, after some great pizza
and beer.

### Granite Mountain, 01/12/2001} 

Ray B. and I took a pre-work hike up this peak. Starting at 6:15 am, we
encountered good trail, then increasing snow to an obvious gully. At this point
we followed kicked steps up about 200 feet until the steps ended on a steep, icy
slope. Time to deploy the Thermarest Shredders! Crampons safely attached, we had
a very enjoyable climb for 2000 feet to the lookout tower on pretty steep
slopes, meandering between short snowfields and boulders. The weather was
"alpine gray," but visibility increased such that from the summit we could see
down to the treeline, and glimpse some holes in the clouds that showed us
Kacheless Lake (I think) and the nordic ski area across the street. We started
down as the sun tried to break through a wall of cloud in the east, happy with
our morning hike. We reached the car at 10:30 where I received a parking pass
ticket from a nice ranger. Crampons and ice ax were very nice to have on this
"surprisingly alpine" hike.
