A great walk from my hotel in Dorf Tirol to the summit of the Mutspitze.
Two weeks before, I attempted it, but deep snow turned me around.

From the summit, I thought about traversing the ridgetop to the Taufenscharte
and descending it to the Leiter Alm, but the snow looked unappealing. I'm
so allergic to snow these days! So I retraced my steps. What a beautiful summit.

1941 meters up/down.
