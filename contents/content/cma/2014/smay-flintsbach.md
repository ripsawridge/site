### Flintsbach
_May 20, 2014_

Great evening climbing session with Hannes. We quickly dispatched
Fliegenschiss (6-) and Steinlaus (6-), then an easier route to the right,
I think grade 5. Then we got on the 8- "sehr stickiges stehproblem,"
which Hannes did an amazing job on. We climbed the easy pitch above
with the 5+ chimney/crack. Then we climbed the route on the right side
of the crag, P1 only, grade 7-. Wonderful. We repeated it on TR.

Finally, as it got dark we climbed a 5+ route back right of
Fruchte der Saison.
