I had the day free to hike, so I took the train to Eschenlohe with my snowshoes
strapped to my back. It was a nice and lonely day to the summit of the Hoher Fricken.
I returned almost the same way, simply using the north ridge for a bit then dropping
into the Frickenkar west of my ascent route. I stopped for tea at the Schaf Alm.
