I brought the boys down on the Steg trail, but we stopped and explored the ruined
castle at Stein. Very interesting place, long an administrative center about 600 years
ago. It's on the side of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere. Whats up with that?

We hung out a while, did some pushups, and walked back up the mountain for cake.

Ritten in the evening, with the Schlern.

It's hard to be a teenager.

We ate dinner where Sigmund Freud hung out. Bitchin!
