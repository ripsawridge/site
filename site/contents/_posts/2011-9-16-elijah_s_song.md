As part of learning how to use the Korg MS-20 synthesizer, I made this
instrumental song last night. The drums are from GarageBand, but all the
other sounds are from multiple MS-20 monophonic vintage synths!
  
  
Today I added some lyrics, and got some sounds from Elijah (at the beginning)
and Rowan (he says "Elijah" in the middle of the song). Click [here](http://www.mountainwerks.org/mwmusic/songs/ElijahSong%20Vocals.mp3) to
listen to this song. Some of the vocal effects are from GarageBand, but
interestingly, others come from routing the vocals through the MS-20 patch
bay, which I see as just the beginning of some fun exploration using that
unit in wild ways.
  
  
Just for review, the [Rowan of the Hills](http://www.mountainwerks.org/mwmusic/songs/Rowan%20of%20the%20Hills.mp3) song
is still available. I made this almost two years ago, and am happy to finally
pay the debt to Elijah of making his song too!
  
  
There is also an instrumental version of the Elijah Song available [here](http://www.mountainwerks.org/mwmusic/songs/ElijahSong.mp3) for
your dance mixes! :D
