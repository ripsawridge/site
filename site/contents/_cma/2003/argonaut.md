Theron and I hiked to the Argonaut-Colchuck col via the Colchuck Glacier on Saturday to 
climb the NW Buttress of Argonaut. This climb should be about 500 feet of 4th and 5th 
class climbing to 5.6. Another way to approach the climb would be to go up Mountaineer's
Creek and camp in the basin below Argonaut Peak. We had rock pro, a picket, 
mountaineering axes and crampons. 


We hiked up to Colchuck Lake, enjoying the views. At the lake, the temperature dropped 
suddenly with a cold wind. We ate some lunch, then Theron's camera "seized up."
On the rest of the trip, Theron gradually perfected his methods of protecting the
camera and keeping it working. Sadly though, in order to take a picture, you had to
really hammer on the shutter button, and the inevitable blurring would be a source
of misery later. 


We were pretty tired at Colchuck Col, almost napping for a few minutes despite the wind
and snow. Clouds drifted over Argonaut, and we descended about 400 feet to a nice
granite buttress. We regained most of that altitude and chose a campsite at the
Argonaut-Colchuck Col. 


I had brought a Betamid tent, but foolishly didn't bring snow stacks. Lots of 
improvisation allowed us to get something that would stay up. We 
cooked dinner in the
tent, which was roomy and protected us from wind. 
Theron gave me a sleeping pill,
and the next morning I was ecstatic with the great sleep I'd had. 
I'd resigned myself
to never sleeping well the first night out on a trip, but those days are over!


The next morning, snow was plastered on near-vertical rock.
An easier line to
the summit lay directly by the tent, and Theron and I both secretly entertained ideas 
of climbing that instead. My curiousity won out. I wanted to see what it would be like
to climb easy rock climbs in snow. Theron and I had climbed the 
<a href="http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2003/toothwinter.htm">
Tooth in January</a>
, but
were blasted by dry, sunny, warm weather! So my dream of cold steep rock was still untested.


We descended a steep ridge and a very icy couloir for 800 feet to get to Argonaut's 
north bowl, then climbed 1000 feet up the "snow finger" described in guidebooks. 
This climb was long and required lots of step kicking. A tiny squirrel lived on the 
slope and occasionally popped up from a hole in the snow.


We started on the rock around 9:30 am in good visibility. Right off the bat 
there was tough climbing with a 30 foot wall on the right of the ridge with good 
blocky handholds. I climbed
with aluminum crampons on my boots, which really takes some getting used to.
Halfway up, I ran out of rope, and had to work out a system with Theron to "undouble"
the 50 meter rope so I could have the full 50 meters. It provided a lesson in the scale
of the ridge, in that I thought 25 meters would be enough to gain the first cliff, but
it took almost double that.


I resorted to direct aid at the top of the cliff where thin rotten snow made it 
hard to find something to grab. I was able to get my axe behind a chockstone and 
pull myself up. Somewhat appalled, I belayed Theron from a snow anchor.


Theron arrived with blood on his face. He was tugging on a hex and it ended violently. 
Only 50 meters up and we were sobered by these conditions. Now it started to snow again. 


I really wanted to keep going, because it looked like after a pitch of snowy 
ramps we'd be able to climb rock and take off the crampons. Ignoring the new 
snow, I started up and ran into a rock step that would be a 30 second operation 
if dry. I was camming my axe into cracks, scrabbling for holds under the snow, 
sweating hard, and finally got up. I belayed at a scrub bush. Theron came up, 
blinked at the belay, and I took off again to climb a snowy ramp on the crest 
to slabs. The next 15 feet looked like the crux of the route. I looked for a 
way around the slab, but it was the only possible route given a serious lack 
of friction. Finally I was able to place a nut, attach a sling and stand up in it. 


With my other foot, crampon points were cammed into a flaring crack. 


I left the security of the sling with my bare hands on crimper holds excavated 
from the snow. Tottering somewhat, I worked for an axe placement at the top of 
the slab for the next minute, heart in my throat. 


Finally I passed the slab, the casual one-handed summertime slab, and reached a 
stance to place some gear. The exposure was intense. I got some good gear and 
continued up into a chimney, life somewhat complicated by a time-bomb block 
shifting under the snow. I had hoped to set a belay in here below a big wedged 
block that looked climbable (although overhanging). Now, scrunched beneath the 
block, with only one decent nut placement and a scary loose boulder below, I 
was mentally ready to call it quits. The climbing had been so hard it was 
unjustifiable for the time we had. Theron felt the same way, feeling we'd 
already gone too far due to "summit fever." He was right. I rappelled from the 
nut and breathed a sigh of relief on reaching Theron's belay. 
We made three more 
rappels to the base of the ridge. Once I saw how low we still were on 
the route, 
I abandoned any second guessing about our decision to leave.


We climbed down into the bowl as the snow increased. On the climb back up to the 
col, we revelled in the scenic beauty of the area. Sun, clouds and peaks put on 
an amazing, ever-changing show, with blasts of wind and spindrift coming down the 
north face of Argonaut. It was a luxury to see these releases of snow and fury 
without endangerment. We could see the North Ridge of Stuart disappearing into a 
black summit cloud. Colchuck Peak from this side has a complex maze of gullies 
and cliffs. There was an amazingly huge cornice on the Col near our camp that we 
trusted to stay in place as we skirted beneath it. There is also an amazing tower 
(I call it the Tower of Adamant) that terminates at the col.


We packed up our camp and eventually gained the Colchuck-Dragontail col. On the way 
Theron saw a ferret (?), but he dipped back under the snow before I saw him. We 
made our
way tiredly down to the lake, but were soon rewarded with great glissading opportunities. 
Many excellent slides down the snow brought smiles to our faces. It's great fun to have 
the feeling of "riding," and look around at the ridges like a passenger on a train. A 
few instances of that will erase whole hours of misery! 


Of course, right at the lake we endured 10 minutes of agony crashing through snowbridges 
over boulders. Theron got stuck and had to dig out at one point. 


We crossed the frozen lake, certainly for the last time this season. We ate and drank 
by a river. Theron was surprised at my sandwiches. The energy provided by them kept 
us going quickly to the car. I think he planned to live on powerbars during the day. 
But a pre-made Safeway sandwich, with seperate mayo and mustard packets is much more appetizing!


Now we know what rock climbs covered in snow (not ice) are like - REALLY HARD. We'll 
know what to expect next time. They can be climbed but it takes a lot longer, and you need
to be able to climb barehanded (something that helped a lot on the last pitch).
You also need to be able to take crampons on and off, or get really good at climbing rock
in crampons (todo...).
For me, I think I'll come back for this climb in the 
summer! Thanks to Theron for great companionship!
