The weather was just too good to miss, so I took a day off to hike up to the
Three Fingers Lookout.  Within weeks, dustings of snow would make the trip
unpleasant, and I had wanted to make this hike since moving to Washington last
March.  I took a small day pack with a water bottle, sunscreen and gaiters, and
I carried my ice ax.


The first two miles went slowly in the early-morning chill.  I moved
as fast as possible along a very humpy and rooty trail.  In some
places, the soil had eroded to 2 feet below a trippy collection
of roots that require balance to cross.  Nothing could diminish my
desire to burn up the miles and the elevation as fast as possible
though.  Here and there I got glimpses of the "fingers" through
a hole in the forest.  They looked very far away.

The trail got better, and soon I was in blueberry-bush country, where
the trail winded along dry creekbeds and up and over lightly forested
hills.  The last water was in here, and I would soon be worrying about
that.  Finally, at 4 miles I came to the Goat Flats camping area, and
the trail led steeply up to Tin Pan Gap.  Along the way, I crossed
a charming south-facing basin with fat marmots chuckling and whistling.
The old miners called them "whistle-pigs," and claimed they were good
eatin'.  Have you noticed that every sentence that refers to miners or
some similar old-west topic is required to use ' characters?


The view from 
Tin Pan Gap was exceptional, I was really impressed by the
broken appearance of the Three Fingers Glacier.  It was tempting to crampon
down to a level-but-crevassed area to explore, but I didn't have crampons.
After a brief rest I headed easterly up the ridge towards the South Peak,
with it's very tiny lookout building on top.  Immediately, I ran into a
big moat (a cleft created where a wall of snow separates from a wall of
rock).  Ready for adventure, I stemmed along in the moat, one foot on the
snow wall, and one on the rock.  My ice ax provided balance by slamming
the pick into the snow. 
Finally, the rock became to steep to progress this
way.  The snow looked quite hard and icy, so I scrambled up the rock a ways.
But I was entering 5th class climbing terrain with no visible exit (except
for the hole of darkness below where the rock/snow separation continued
into a cold, wet grave!).  I climbed back down and decided to try the
snow, and this worked pretty well.  After a few yards, I found the trail
again and left the steep snow happily.

Later I climbed a mini-peak on the ridge and descended a gully on the
other side because the trail around was very snow-covered.  Incredibly
pleased, I trolloped along, memorizing R. Service poetry:

    No!  there's the land (have you seen it?), 
    It's the cussedest land that I know. 
    From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it,
    to the deep, deathlike valleys below.
    Some say god was tired when he made it,
    some say it's a fine land to shun.
    Maybe, but there's some as would trade it,
    for no land on earth, and I'm one.

Back on the south slope and running low on water, I endured a hot, rocky
plod around a basin and slowly up.  After this the trail steepened and
switchbacked up the side of the South Peak.  Along here I got some much-needed
water from snowmelt, and a little shade too.  I emerged on a large, low-angle
snowfield, made for easy walking and a fun glissade on the way home.  After
this, there were about 300 feet of easy scrambling, following cairns left
by others.  The cairns were a bit random though, and sometimes I would just
head up, following my nose (I can smell lookout towers!).

Long before I expected it, I rounded a corner and was greeted by the three
ladders to the summit.  I've read about these ladders, and how frightening
they are.  They are quite exposed: almost right below you is a 1000 foot
drop to the glacier.  But it's very easy to hang on!  There is also a
rope to aid in moving from one ladder to the next.  I would only worry about
these ladders if they were covered in ice.


The lookout was cool.  In fact, I'm not going to talk about it much.  I was
rather moved by the log book.  
One couple hiked up on their 30th "lookout" anniversary.  The lookout is
a very special place, because people who come here keep it neat and clean.
Sadly, it seems that too much exposure can ruin such experiences.



After a nice lunch and a nap, I climbed down the ladders and the rocks to
the snow slope.  I did some clumsy standing glissades then continued down
the faint trail.  I got some more water at the snowmelt for the thirsty
trip back.  The afternoon had become very hot, and hazy due to forest
fires around Lake Chelan.  


The whistle-pigs must have been hiding in their dens, because I didn't hear a
peep on the way out.  When I got to the moat, I realized that I could have
avoided the tricky work had I just looked around a bit more: the trail was 15
feet off to the side of it!  I must have been eager for adventure.  I took the
trail for the way home!


After a few miles I ran out of water, refilling at a muddy seep along the way.
The last two miles seemed to take 27 years, but finally I was back at the car.  
I'm writing this in early October, and the rains have 
started.  I'll bet the ladders are a bit icy now!
