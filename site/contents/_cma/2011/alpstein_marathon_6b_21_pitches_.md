Adrian and I took a day off work to go do a climb that he'd had his eye
on for months. A 21 pitch monster called "Alpsteinmarathon," it's the longest
climb in the Appenzell Mountains of Switzerland. Over 800 meters of climbing
through long and sustained pitches, it wouldn't be easy as we both felt
a bit out of rock climbing shape despite being in peak condition a month
before. Activity had fallen off to nothing! Oh well, let's see what we
can do...

We drove down after work and hiked in to the Bollenwies Hut under the
stars, arriving at about 10:30 pm. After many admonishments to remove our
shoes and put on our pants (well, for Adrian. It's a long story, but he
was kind of just hiking in shorts that looked suspiciously like underwear),
we were allowed up to a room to sleep. In the morning we hiked for 15 minutes
along the beautiful narrow lake to the start of the route, only about 50
meters above the lake and a small sheep farm.
  
  
I got the first lead, a 6a+ "entry test," that was indeed a good test.
Strenuous but fun too. I combined with the next pitch and ran into what
would be a common problem on the climb: awkward bolt clips. In fact I had
to climb up and down 3 times to feel secure enough to clip this particular
bolt, which required pasting feet on a crumbly, sandy slab, and making
due with an equally crumbly handhold. Above this clip the pitch was enjoyable
again, going over a little roof to broken face.

Adrian continued and we swapped leads for a while. The sun was getting
uncomfortably hot, and this part of Europe has been in a heat wave for
over a week. Our energy already flagging, we worried about being able to
finish the climb. Increasingly, I thought hiking or swimming was the right
thing to be doing now!
  
  
Pitch 6 was an amazing steep face which required some commitment. A long
(8 meter?) runout between bolts mandated a nut placement, thankfully bomber.
I really enjoyed the continuous 6a moves on this pitch. Adrian took the
next, at similar difficulty, then led the crux pitch with it's outsized
difficulty of 6b+. Aside from this pitch, the route is 6a+. Adrian used
an aider to get past most of the pitch, which was fairly sustained. Following,
I could climb free until a brutal transition out of a crack to a face and
slabby terrain on the right, then I was happy for the etrier Adrian had
left me. I remembered that aiding is pretty tough too, twisting around
on slings and basically doing pull-ups on occasion. Emerging at the belay
short of breath, I was happy for Adrian to lead again.
  
  
At pitch 10 we started swapping leads again. In here, beaten down by the
heat, I started pulling on draws reflexively. How would we possibly finish?
We had a fair amount of water left, but were conserving it. The rubber
in our shoes heated up so much that we had to try to keep the toes out
of the sun to prevent painful burns. A few days later, I've got a nasty
blister on the back of my ankle where I missed a spot of sunscreen. Only
our stubbornness kept us on the rock for the next few pitches. We slowed
down, cheated liberally and just tried to keep moving. The forecast called
for some clouds in the afternoon and we were counting on that! I try to
write down a detailed pitch description right after a climb, but for the
life of me, I can't remember a stitch of pitch 11 (5c), which Adrian led.
Was I a zombie?
  
  
Pitch 14 was cruxy at 6a+. I climbed enjoyable slab, then had a heart
stopping moment traversing to the left with a crumbly undercling hold and
slowly slipping-off feet. Although mostly a bolted climb, it's not "over-bolted"
at all. A fall in here wouldn't be great. I pressed my cheek to the wall
and contemplated the few millimeters of skin and rubber holding me to the
wall as I pawed for a right handhold. Whew! That was a certain kind of
fun! At this point I started cursing like a sailor and would continue for
the rest of the climb. Me and Adrian both, actually.

But some shade was sent by deities unknown, and did so much to improve
my spirits. Adrian hit "the wall" a pitch or two later, feeling unable
to free climb for a while and making strenuous moves in slings. Stubborn
man, he pulled through and regained strength as we climbed in shadier conditions.
  
  
Pitch 16 climbed a runout face (well, I missed a bolt, that's why!) to
a steep chimney with a tough exit. Pitch 18 featured a slabby buttress,
a dicey move around into a gully (I pulled on this draw), then a fantastic
overhanging crack. Finally, a "sting in the tail" with a really difficult
traverse of a steep slab to reach the belay. This route makes you work
for every inch!

Adrian came up, asked me to sign the route book at the belay, and set
out on a hard move right off the belay (6a+), going past an overhang via
crack and face. After this workout, thankfully the long pitch moderated
considerably on a left-leaning journey to easier ground. Another pitch
led to the grande finale: the 15 meter pitch 21, rated 5b.

Here we had a hilarious argument, though we were really mad at the moment.
I felt it was really important to clip these last two bolts, but Adrian
wanted to do a "walkaround" of those final moves. We hollered at each other
heatedly for a minute, me demanding to lead the pitch if he wouldn't, and
Adrian pointing out I was being an unreasonable son-of-a-bitch. Finally
he told me to f\*(k off at which point we both broke up laughing. We were
tired, strained and at the end of our tethers...finally we'd been able
to step outside ourselves for a moment and see the ridiculousness of the
situation. "Okay, I'll clip your bolt, but MY WAY!" he said with a smirk.
In the end he didn't clip it. As I followed the pitch, flipping the rope
over the buttress crest so I could follow the bolt line I had to admit
it was both hard and contrived. I guess the routesetter wants to make sure
that the last move feels the hardest, because 5b after 20 pitches will
certainly feel like 6a+, at least.

We were all smiles on the summit, happy to have a lot of work done with,
enjoying the evening air and lack of hot sun (it was 7 pm, the climbing
took about 11 hours which was 3 hours over "normal time"). We shared Adrian's
sandwiches, looking out to the Bodensee, and in to Saentis and other Appenzell
peaks. We saw gaemse grazing steep meadows. We hiked down, reaching the
Bollenwies in an hour, where beer and coffee restored what was missing.
Laughing and talking with two women on a multi-day hike, listening to an
impromptu men's choir, we watched the light fade from the dark water. Hiking
away, 23 hours after we arrived, we made the long drive home.
  
  
Thank you Adrian for a good adventure! Thanks to the weather, the mountain
and the route.
