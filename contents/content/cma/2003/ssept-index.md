<h3>Index climbing, September 28, 2003</h3>

In the early evening, Theron and I climbed Godzilla, 
it was his first time on the route.
A bit tough, but manageable! We were both tired due to a long break from
rock climbing (more than a month!). As it got dark, we simul-climbed up
Pisces, and rappelled in inky darkness.
