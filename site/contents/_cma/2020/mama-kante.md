Jong and I climbed the MaMa-Kante (V+) on the Kreuzwandspitze above
the Dammkarhütte today. Here are some pics!

Our peak, the Kreuzwandspitze is on the right.

Our climb. Note the two parties of three roping up. They were quite
fast! We came near them occasionally through the day, but never close enough
to exchange awkward COVID-era conversation.

On the first pitch, which features a crack splitting a slabby buttress.

Jong on the second pitch, leading out.

Climbers get over a bulge on some otherwise easy ground in the upper
half of the route.

Eye-watering view from the top of the route, showing the hut and the
various Karwendel paths that allow commerce to pass through this
harsh land.

The two (related?) parties of 3 above us walk companionably over to the
true summit from the cross marking the end of the route. I suppose the
cross is placed there so that it would be visible from the
Dammkarhütte.

Jong has a collection of gear for sale.

Going down, back home!
