[Itsy Bitsy House](itsybitsyhouse_complete.pdf)
  
I made it back from the architecture conference in Boston to play guitar
at the kindergarten Christmas concert. It was really important because
I took a book the kids really like, "Itsy Bitsy House" and made sheet music
to it. The tune is really simple, but what was really amazing was the effort
the teachers at school put into it. There are four animals in the story,
and each one was played by a child in a great costume (a mouse, a dog,
a cat and a billygoat). There was a house, there was "lightning" and many
other props. Rowan played the Old Man who invites the cold animals into
the house. I guess it's kind of a Christmas story in a way, too. Rowan
was so cute in his beard and lederhosen! Kris took many pictures but tragically,
because of a bug in the USB card reader software, they were all deleted!!
Maybe we'll get some from some other parents later.
  
  
I used [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org/web) to write the music
up, and you can see my work [here](itsybitsyhouse_complete.pdf).
