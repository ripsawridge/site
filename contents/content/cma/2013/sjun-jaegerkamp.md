### Jägerkamp
_June 4, 2013_

Hiked up Jaegerkamp with Josef after dinner, via his cross-country route.
Beautiful sunset above a cloud sea. My decaying sneakers were the worst
possible footwear on steep grassy slopes streaked with snow. The slightest
inclined caused a slip...eventually I had to use my hands in the snow a lot. We
would have hiked over to bag another summit if I'd had some boots!
