### Aiplspitz

Before a big trip I wanted to get in a little bit of hiking conditioning. I
found the Aiplspitz across the street from the Wendelstein and decided to head
up that on the spur of the moment. Offering about 950 meters elevation
gain/loss, there was a nice hike up a road to a meadow offering cheese for
sale. I bought some for a friend. The final scramble to the summit was
entertaining, I had to use my hands a bit.
