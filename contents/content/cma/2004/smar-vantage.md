### Vantage Climbing, March 20, 2004
Peter, Kim and I went out for some climbing. We narrowly escaped a car
accident on the way when a truck cut off a car in front of us. That car
wildly swung across the interstate, barely escaped rolling, and came
to a stop after 360 degrees in the median. We rode right through their
path, also coming to a gentle stop in the median. I helped push the
guy's car out of the median where it had dug itself in. He was lucky,
we were lucky - the truck that cut him off should feel lucky too.
So anyway, Peter led "Chossmaster" (5.7) as one long pitch, a good
warm up, but Kim was disconcerted by the different character of the
rock from her plastic medium of the last few months! Then I got fired
up to go crack climbing, so I led "Tangled up in Blue (5.9)," having
to rest on the rope twice, not used to the complexity of placing 
gear and actually climbing! That tired me out, so I rested while
Peter and Kim climbed "Vantage Point (5.8)," a great arete climb they
both enjoyed. Then I led "Crossing the Threshold (5.8)," a considerably
easier crack climb, but really fun. Kim followed it, maybe it was her
first 5.8 crack climb? The exit was really loose and ugly, we had to
be very careful getting up to the plateau. Theron and Justin stopped
by to say hello, and we finished by Peter leading "Party in your Pants
(5.8)," aka "Twin Cracks." I followed it. I'm always giving him a hard 
time for his hexes, but he made some great placements with them I must say.
Alas, we had to go home early for a dinner appointment. Really fun
time though, thanks guys!
