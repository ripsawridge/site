Josef and I had the day to ski. But I never saw Josef! A series of mishaps
prevented us from making our rondesvous at 5:30 am in Holzkirchen. Basically
he and I waited for each other separately, then like good alpine citizens,
set off on our own solo adventures. While Josef stayed closer to home (building
a nonetheless punishing regime of up and down among the smaller peaks),
I went for one big mountain: the Schoentalspitze.
  
  
I'd first skied it a year ago, but there were too many clouds to get a
good view. Today was very cold (-17 C in the bottom of the valley!), but
clear, and I couldn't wait to see the sun. I started skinning up around
8 am. I passed a bundle of folks, surprising myself because I am hacking
up mucus and generally sounding like someone who lives on the streets!
Must be Crossfit...
  
  
Below the summit, a guy psyched me out by looking sketchy above, and so
I took off skis pretty low on the slope. Climbing up in boots was hella
awkward, lots of post-holing or granite slabs with thin layers of snow.
Finally on top, I found a wind-protected place to sit. Some other guys
came up and soon there was a big crowd crammed into my little "park bench."
I freaked them out when I left, because I accidentally grabbed somebody
elses ski poles. I couldn't understand that they were telling me to bring
them back! Then I climbed back down into the wind shelter area, and promptly
stole another persons poles instead. Oh brother...

The ski down was good. Great actually, I had a lot of powder to practice
in, and felt like I really improved. Of course I crashed twice...plastering
my face with icy crystals of death! Yowwww!
  
  
I can't wait for the next chance to ski powder...I think I'm getting somewhere.
Of course the last slope was a crusty, skied-out narrow chute of fighting,
scraping, jump-turning, just whatever.
