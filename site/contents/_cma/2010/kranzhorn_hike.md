Danno, Kris, the boys and I hiked up the Kranzhorn, maybe the last chance
to do so before snow embraces it's summit and the little hut on the meadow
beneath. It was really fun to have Danno join us! We had a great time on
the hike to the summit, then enjoyed hanging around the hut a while on
the way down. Thanks to Danno for joining!
