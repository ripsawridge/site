Carlos and I set off early Sunday morning for a climb of Ruth Mountain.
I had always wanted to climb it for the great view of Mt. Shuksan. We took a 25
meter rope, crampons, axes and an ice screw which would come in really handy.
It would be Carlos's first alpine climb, and he was naturally excited.


We parked at the trailhead and began walking up the old mining road, admiring
the peaks on the right side of Ruth Creek that make up Nooksack Ridge.
Before long, we'd reached Hannegan Pass. It was my second time here, the
first being an ill-fated trip to Mt. Challenger 2 years before. Ruth
Mountain looked spectacular with slopes of gray ice that contrasted well 
with the fall colors.

We stopped for a break above the pass, then up and down along a ridge to
a ridiculously steep "trail" that ascended muddy washout slopes to a high 
rocky shoulder. In spring, I'm told that this can be a dangerous area
due to soft snow and cliffs below. At this point it was a walk across
talus slopes with beautiful views of the Chilliwack River valley.
We reached a ridge crest at 5500 feet with fresh snow, and began
traversing southwest towards the gentle north ridge of Ruth.

While Carlos and I practiced roped glacier travel on the lower slopes,
a man approached and chatted for a while. A quick lesson in self-arresting
and ice axe usage convinced me that Carlos was ready for an easy glacier.
We felt kind of "old school" because we tied the ropes around our waist with
a bowline on a coil rather than use a modern sit harness.
Carlos did really well, soon adapting to the flat-footed use of crampons and
steady switchbacking up slopes. We started passing some large crevasses,
and eventually had to cross some ice bridges.


I was surprised at the condition of the glacier. It reminded me more of the
Corkscrew Glacier than the Sitkum, if you know what I mean! We continued up
what seemed to be the North Ridge of the peak, finally coming to a crevasse
that couldn't be climbed into and out of easily. We had to lose a few hundred
feet going down and around on the right. I wondered if we would be barred
from the summit by more slotses, my preciousss. Now we skirted the
western side of the North Ridge and came against rocky slopes of the West
Ridge. We climbed into a crevasse with a partial floor where Carlos could
belay a short steep climb out the other side. I chopped a few handholds,
and frontpointed my way up to a ledge. Using the ice screw, I belayed
Carlos up to me, and we continued over one more such obstacle to the summit.

Wow, what a view we had! It was nice and warm, and we could admire the
convoluted terrain of Nooksack Cirque and Icy Peak. We would have loved
to climb that too, but the belaying and route-finding on the glacier meant
we would be running too late. Still, there was plenty of time to soak in
the scenery and the special quiet of high places. The solo traveller had
turned back at the first crevasses, probably a wise idea as they had
become more complex.  


For speed and safety, we wanted to find a better way down. It looked feasible
to go down gentle slopes to the subpeak on the east. Then steeper terrain
leads to manageable glacier several hundred feet below. We had seen that
terrain on the way up (on the other side of an impassable crevasse), and 
thought it would go.

In the picture above, we've come down the worst of that area, with a final
jump that required some gusto. Carlos, as he is prone to do, described it 
as easy once finished! On the steeper slopes I belayed Carlos down from
an ice screw belay, as front pointing was new and unusual. Now we wended
our way happily down to the rocks below the glacier where we could unrope
and remove crampons. Very happy with our climb, we set off for home.


Carlos has a strong exploratory streak, and thought we could get down
to the trail on the west side of Hannegan Pass directly from the
gentle north ridge coming from Ruth. I was curious too, so we went down
a few hundred feet on heather slopes. Unfortunately, we soon came to
cliffs on one side and an unpleasant long dirt gully on the other.
Between that and an unknown amount of bushwhacking on the valley floor,
I voted for climbing back up and taking the trail. We did this, then
were rewarded with our climb back up with some pretty white Ptarmigans
nested on the ridge for us. We admired them, then continued down.
We finally had to use headlamps about a mile from the car.


This was a really enjoyable day with plenty of surprises on the glacier. If
you are climbing in the spring or summer, all of my comments about "gaping
crevasses" and "ice screw belays" can be discarded! Thanks for coming along
Carlos!
