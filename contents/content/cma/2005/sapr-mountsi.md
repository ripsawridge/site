### Mount Si, April 10, 2005

Whoa, Kris woke up early and we had to go to
the emergency room because as it turned out: she
needed her gall-bladder removed! I took the boys back
home, fed 'em, and then we picked her up in the
afternoon because the surgery was scheduled for Tuesday. With a few hours of daylight left, I decided
to hike up Mount Si. Carrying only a bottle of water, a headlamp and the trusty iPod, I hiked up the regular trail, then on the old trail for the last mile. Although rain was gathering on the horizons I scrambled up the haystack, moving too fast at one point: I bumped my head hard on a rock! A great panorama awaited me, though I could smell the rain over Issaquah on the wind. I descended quickly, then ran down the trail as fast as possible, using the headlamp in the final mile. 2.5 hours round trip.
