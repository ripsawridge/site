Actually we only went as far as the now-closed for rennovation
hut. Long interesting talk with a man working on the alpine garden
behind the hut. He pointed out it is nearly 100 years old now.
We talked about the plants, about hope for the future and the
changing climate. Very interesting fellow!

Smoked a cigar while Sammy surveyed the landscape.
