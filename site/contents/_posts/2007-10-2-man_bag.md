So we spent the afternoon at the Oktoberfest Wies'n with Bob and Mardi
today. "Wies'n" means meadow, but it's actually a good old fairground or
carnival. A really big one! We went to the Paulaner tent around 10:30 am,
and ordered beer and sausages. Well, Kris ordered a Coke, but she promised
to drink with us in the wine tent. I drank a full liter "Mass", and Bob
and Mardi shared one (wimps!). Our tablemates were a nice couple from Edmonton,
Canada.

Mardi and Bob...cheating a little bit - they were sharing one!

Bob acting French. Lots of scowling and _Merde!_
  
  
Back outside we admired the good food at the Kaefer tent, but there was
nowhere to sit, so we went to the wine tent. Upstairs there were plenty
of seats so we grabbed a table. Bob, Mardi and I each had a 1/2 liter Weissbier,
and Kris had a Merlot, but dang it wasn't very good. Kind of vinegery?
We ordered Dampfnudeln, which is like a piece of hot cake in vanilla sauce,
and also homemade chocolate ice cream.
  
  
Now Kris, Bob and Mardi rode the famous Tobaggan ride, where drunk people
are hefted up a conveyer belt to hilarious effect. Everyone tries to stand
up in a dignified way, but watching people roll, bob, weave, dance and
experience pratfalls has become a spectater sport. The actual slide to
ride down from the tower is just an aftereffect. Mardi started to fall
and got some help from one of the burly men supervising the belt. Bob turned
in a marvelous athletic performance, and when I say marvelous I mean boring!
Kris refused all offers of help from the burly attendants and immediately
slipped and fell, laughing (or crying?) as the belt carted her up on her
back! She did get the loudest crowd reaction though and that's what it's
all about I think!
  
  
Next we rode a water roller coaster, where I alone got pretty soaked.
The drops were really fun, and we laughed a lot. Before we could lose our
buzz we had to repair back into a tent. First a stop off to the Kaefer
tent for Kris to have a big shot of vodka, then into the Loewenbraeu tent,
a really rowdy place. We found a seat next to some guys from Birmingham,
England. Another Mass of beer for me, which Kris tried to drink from. Bob
and Mardi shared another one. Bob bought some cigars, so pretty soon he
and I were quaffing beer from our enormous glasses, smoking up the place
with our cigars. And caught up in the excitement of it all, the English
guys even got me and Mardi to try snuff tobacco. Seems like a good thing
if you have a cold and your sinuses are blocked up.

I don't know everything that happened from there, but there was lots of
shouting and laughing. I remember the guy next to me was Welsh and he spilled
beer all over my leg. I said at least now I can piss my own pants without
fear of embarrassment. For some reason that was really funny (to me). At
some point Mardi quietly revealed that I have a sort of "man purse" to
carry my jacket, wallet and other things. Word got out quickly, and soon
the whole table was chanting "MAN BAG!" and pointing at me. "He has a MAN
BAG!" I tried unsuccessfully to stem the tide by pointing out that my satchel
was, properly termed, a "European Carryall (TM)". Hoo boy, that just made
it worse. Finally I decided it's better to go down with the ship, so I
raised my man-purse high and proclaimed to one and all that yes! I have
a Man-bag, and I'm proud! Also it's a very nice green.
  
  
Somewhere after all this, and after competing with Bob to blow smoke rings
we started singing. Just whatever. But it has to be delivered in the loudest,
hoarsest shout you can conjure up. I thought, "what do I know of Britain?"
and started a chorus of "Our House" by Madness. It died out quickly because
nobody knew the words beyond the first part. Finally Kris and I looked
at our watches, realizing we'd turn into adults again in less than an hour
when the babysitter had to go home, and took our leave with a mixture of
reluctance and relief!
  
  
Kris took the train but Mardi, Bob and I walked to clear our heads. It
was useful! But on the walk home we couldn't help but get a big sandwich
and another beer. What a Sunday!
