Elijah has been drawing horses. I can't tell they are horses, but he says
"whorshe!" or "weeo-weeo-weeo-weeo" which is his version of a whinny. Kris
said he drew her, copying my cartoon style of sharp lines for long black
hair. Neat! Rowan wanted me to read stories this morning, and I didn't
want to because I was composing new chords for the "I'm a little teapot
song." To give it a modern feel I did it with these chords:

`  
I'm a little tea pot, short and stout  
E            E/G#     C#mi      B  
Here is my handle, here is my spout.  
A          E       C          B7  
When I get all steamed up, hear me shout.  
E              G#7         C#mi    B  
Tip! me over and pour me out.  
A       C        B       E  
`
  
  
Later I came and read "Teeth are not for Biting," and Kris read "Diggers,"
an old favorite.
