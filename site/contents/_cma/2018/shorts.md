### Kreuzeck
_March 1, 2018_
Jaro, Camillo, Andreas and I skied up after work. A cold but beautiful evening with
a full moon. It was our first time up here. The ski route took us through a special
tunnel built just for ski touring folk! Pretty hilarious.

We got dinner on the way down at the Restaurant Kreuzalm in the ski area, which was
packed with the ski touring crowd. The way down was fast and icy, but nice.


### Brauneck
_February 18, 2018_
Quick run up in the afternoon. 1.5 hours, I was faster because I didn't take
the slow way around to the Floriansh√ºtte.

### Brauneck
_February 8, 2018_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck this morning in light snow.
I was pretty sweaty because I wanted to keep my jacket on in the snow.
Hmpf! Great run down, one lame fall where I hurt my thumb, a bit.
900 meters up/down.
