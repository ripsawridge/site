Kris, the boys and I had a great day at the Starnberg Lake. The weather
was warm and sunny. The boys took their bikes, and we went to lay on the
grass near the water. The boys had a great time running around. We pigged
out on raisins and croissants too. There was some sadness because Rowan
fell into a creek (he was jumping across it again and again), so he had
to take his pants off and wander around in a diaper for a while. Then on
the way back his bike tire deflated. We finished the 5 hour visit with
apfelstruedel at a restaurant by the lake. The kids got a great workout,
and we enjoyed the sun.
  
  
Looking forward to more days like that coming up!
