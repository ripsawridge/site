*I wrote this in 2012, and stumbled across it while moving files to SimpleNote. It's about parallels I saw between "inner development" and what we do in the outer, physical world. Enjoy!*

For the past 15 years, I've been an enthusiastic mountaineer, and it's been fascinating to trace some threads from that activity that resonate well with what 
[Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Material) has to say. I found myself with an impulse to travel across the land, first in a horizontal mode (through the forest), and then vertical. Since then I've continually shored up my skills and experience with that in mind. I've learned that what a climb is for me is a "miniature life," packed into a day, or a few days. It has an arc of the type present in gripping stories, and I can't help but see the larger life I pursue as an encompassing arc around the smaller ones. I'll try to illustrate through my pictures how the activity readied me to embrace a multidimensional universe.

The violence of the pre-dawn start...like birth! An aggressive act! ;-)

Initial energy disappated in worry over conditions of the rock or snow. Getting lost, fear of the storm.



Establishing a foothold. A tenuous position, but the way ahead is visible. Friends and partners chosen, standing by you.

The sun arrives...reward for effort. The thrilling view: look how far we've come!

Now, with fatigue setting in: the crux. To return from this point would be disaster. You *must* go on. And because you must...you do.


One foot in front of the other. You've reached a meditative state. Quickly firing synapsis are no longer necessary. The arc of meaning dances just out of reach. You are on top.

And you do it again, and again. It's a wonderful life within a life!

Your works of art are fragile creations, lasting only in the minds of those 1 or 2 or 3 companions. Their creation was fraught with risk: it's a wonder you pulled it off!

You descend. It is not over. It is only half over. Much adventure awaits. Stow the experience for now, to be pulled out again before sleep, head spinning.

The unplanned night out, the wheeling stars. The phantoms, helpful when you are exhausted. They are real, I have seen them. Mine wears white slacks and a red sweater...not dressed for the mountains at all!

You relax. You are high for days. Close your eyes and enter another world. This is fuel.

This is life.
