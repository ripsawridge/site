An article at the NYT about a kid who gets bullied repeatedly [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/us/24land.html?ref=opinion).
I was a subject of bullying in the 6th through 9th grade. The memories
are painful. I really feel for this kid. It's a very isolating feeling,
and a vicious circle. If you "tell," then you are a tattle-tale, and fair
game for worse treatment. Also, it's surprising how often (most of the
time) you get no help from school authorities. What I came away with was
the feeling that they were afraid of the bullies too.
  
  
For me, learning to play guitar helped get me out of that lowest social
class: awkward misfits who could always be taunted as "faggots." Being
in that box and looking out at things like the pretty girls feels like
being on the moon. It's easy to hate everyone, because it seems like everyone
is complicit in what's happening to you. Now that I'm older I know they
were just unaware.
  
  
Anyway...not so good times.
