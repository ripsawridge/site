Barbara and I took the lift up (free for me on Father's Day!), then abseiled
down to the start of the route. Seven fun pitches followed, the best
was pitch 5, at 40 meters and grade IV. Sustained and interesting
climbing in a chimney. Barbara had it tougher though, as a crowd of
people were around at that point, and a woman found the climbing
very difficult -- that took some of the fun away!

Barbara loved that there was snow in the summer here.
