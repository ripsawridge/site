### Green Mountain, 12/24/2002}

I'd wanted to hike up Green Mountain for years, but the opportunity
always eluded me. Why not on Christmas Eve morning? I begged a few
hours away from the home fires and made the drive, which took a full
two hours from Woodinville. There was snow on the road for the last 2
miles, but I was able to drive without chains. Snow started
immediately but the trail was well packed until making traverses on
the first steep slope. The morning was beautiful, with blue sky over
the snow covered meadows and soft yellow sunbeams through a band of
cloud. The distance from town and the weather forecast of an impending
storm made me worry about getting back down the road.



Indeed, the clouds got lower and lower. First Glacier Peak
disappeared, then successively nearer peaks were truncated by gray,
then covered completely. After the tarns, I snowshoed steeper slopes
towards the highest point. Heavy snowfall, bitter wind and spindrift
made the final steps uncomfortable for my frozen face!  I stood on the
concrete that marked the lookout for about 20 seconds to admire the
view of whirling snow and gloomy valleys. Descent was uneventful,
except for a "shortcut" that led me into a slide alder field. I soon
realized my mistake and corrected my course. Good thing, because I was
way off! My car had two inches of snow when I reached it at 12:50 pm,
4 1/2 hours after I started. Merry Christmas!

### Little Si, 12/21/2002}

Kris and I hiked up her favorite trail. We got a very late start
(3 pm) for the shortest day of the year, but we had headlamps
ready for the trip down. But we were happy to reach the car just
before full dark, the headlamps unused, unneeded, in the pack!

### McClellan's Butte, 12/14/2002}

Theron Welch and I got an early start for a half-day trip up this
local conditioning peak. We had umbrellas against the steady rain,
and enjoyed the pleasant walk up past various gravel roads. There
was plenty to talk about, especially the little-known Gore Range
in the Colorado Rockies. About halfway up, we encountered snow,
which deepened quickly. Theron didn't have gaiters, so on the few
times I mercilessly put him in front to break trail, he got soaked.
He invented a scheme of tied shoelaces which I nick-named 
"Piggly-Wiggly gaiters" after a well-known supermarket in the
southeast. We got occasional cloud-breaks and less rain as we
approached the summit. We were really surprised at the large
amount of heavy, wet snow. At the summit ridge we prepared for
the scramble, stepping out into a screaming wind. "Is this
advisable?" I was ready to turn back when Theron found a better
way at an impasse. One more crux move right along the knife-edge
of the ridge got us past the difficulties to a sheltered area
where we could rewarm hands (mine got numb going up and down).
On the summit we saw the clouds part two or three times to
a great wintry view of Mt. Kent. But before we could take a picture,
a new cloud came screaming into place. We descended cautiously,
then bounded down the trail easily. We ran into three parties,
presumably grateful for our tracks ;-). A very small avalanche 
had obliterated a portion of the trail on the way down.
Theron's car had heated seats, a nice reward!

### Mount Si, 11/26/2002}

Another morning trip in the great weather spell. Peter and I took the old
trail up Mount Si. Due to the new Little Si trailhead, I got especially
confused in the darkness of morning, lamenting that we were probably
lost for the first 1500 feet of climbing (flashbacks to my trip here in
July, and "Meth house" encounter at 1500 feet). But we did just fine,
scrambling up the haystack and exploring other possible ascent routes.
We hurried down to work, going a little too fast because Peter's left
knee started hurting. A great morning.

### Exit 38 Climbing, 11/21/2002}

Alex, Peter and I went for a morning climb in the unusually good weather.
First Alex led "Underground Economy (5.9)." I pink-pointed it (draws left
in place), then Peter followed. Now we walked to "We Did Rock," where
Alex led "Blockhead (5.9)" and we followed it. I led "Sobriety (5.9),"
having a nice fall because I got off route. This route was pretty tough!
Peter and Alex top-roped it, Alex taking a blank-slab variation to the left.
There was just enough time for me to lead "Blockhead", then we had to go to
work.

### Index Climbing, 10/6/2002}

We wanted to play with our new video camera, so Peter, Kris and I
climbed Great Northern Slab, and filmed it. We also pulled down the
rope to a belay at the "Pisces" route, a 5.6 crack that goes right up
to the same belay as G.N.S. What a great hand crack! Kris got the
action on tape. Then we climbed the third pitch, filmed it, and rapped
off. A good afternoon, but I got a bit ill after the Zeke's burger on
the way there.

### Leavenworth Climbing, 10/5/2002}

Kris, Aidan and I drove out to L-town. Kris caught up on some sleep
while Aidan and I went to the "Pearly Gates" crag. Aidan and I both
led the first pitch of Cloud Nine (5.9), then I led "No Room for
Squares" (5.8), and he led and I followed "Lost Souls" (5.9). These
were all excellent climbs! Then we looked around the corner at some
other ideas, and finally came back where I led
"Celestial Grove (5.9+)," which had a very burly
start, kind of a "highball" bouldering problem. Aidan followed on
that, then we top-roped "Pearly Gates" (5.10c).  Aidan successfully
passed the roof, but I wasn't able to. We went back to the car, and
tried to go climb "Classic Crack", but a teaching party had taken over
the route (two belayers, etc.). So I led "Dogleg Crack" (5.8+), which
was a nemesis of mine. Aidan came up, and then the three of us filmed
some stuff with our camera. A great crack-climbing day, topped off by
a visit to "Heidelburgers."

![Michael on Celestial Grove}{topofit.jpg)

### Exit 38, 9/24/2002}

Peter, Kim and I hiked up in the morning. Kris would have come but was
eager to be home for delivery of a computer. We climbed "Just because
you're Paranoid... (5.8)," and "Lush (5.9)."  Fun, juggy climbing on a
nice morning with friends!

### Exit 38, 9/??/2002}

Peter and I hiked up to Bob's Wall after work. We'd never been there
before, and were impressed.  We climbed

* "Killer Bob (5.9)," 
* "Peanut Brittle (5.8)," 
* "A Castle So Crystal Clear (5.8)," 

and attempted what might have been "Chainsaw Chalupa (5.8)," but it
felt a lot harder than that. Lots of fun.  But we had to hike out in
the dark without headlamps. Really slow!

### Index Climbing, 7/16/2002}

Jeff Smoot and I went to Index to get some pitches in before work. We
climbed the first two "pitches" of Libra Crack (5.8). I felt kind of
sketchy leading the second pitch, a reminder to go rock climbing more
often! Then we connected to the fun 5.6 crack of Pisces. After
rappelling down to the iron bolts, we had a great climb of Velvasheen
(5.7, R). This was a really fun, kind of tricky climb. It was long
too, finishing at the trees that mark the end of the third pitch of
Great Northern Slab. From here, we hiked up a short steep trail to a
small crag with two bolts. Jeff led this great 5.10a climb, placing a
cam below a roof, then making a burly move to the first bolt. Short
but fun! We made 4 rappels to the base, and drove to work. [On the way
in, we nearly got a ticket for driving down a closed road, but Jeff
did a great job of heading this off with a dumb n' friendly attitude!]


### Esmerelda Basin, Gallagher Lake, 7/6-7/2002}

Kris and I hiked up the basin and camped for the night at Fortune Pass. There
is just a small snowfield to hike across near the end (almost
level). An evening hike to look at Lake Ann, and a scramble to the
6500 ft. peak above the pass provided rewarding views of Chimney Rock
and Mt. Daniels. As we prepared to leave in the morning, it started
raining, but not enough to prevent us from hiking to Gallagher Lake
and out on the Deroux trail. In light rain, we hiked down on many
switchbacks to the jeep trail in the valley below Mt. Hawkins. Then we
hiked up 500 feet to Gallagher Lake, which, along with adjoining
meadows, was very pretty. I expected to see jubilant 4-wheelers
shrieking and spinning out in the mud, but we had this whole stretch
of trail to ourselves, possibly due to lingering snow. We hiked down
to the pretty vale below the lake, and the sun came out as we hiked
around a swath of avalanche debris that buried the trail. As we
approached the car, day-hikers appeared. Once at the trailhead, I hiked
up the road 1.5 miles to get the car at the Esmerelda Basin parking
lot. A fun easy loop trip! Go soon, before the shrieking and the
spinning out commence!

### Bare Mountain, 7/5}

Yawn, work was very quiet. Can a pika escape for the afternoon? My
paws trembled with anticipation as I drove the long, long road to Bare
Mountain. Massive clearcuts and industrial forestland whizzed by. At 3
PM I reached the trailhead and scampered up a bouldery roadbed to a
river crossing. There is a good log across the first half, then you
hop three rocks to finish. I saw 6 people on this trail, but was happy
to share it - it is incredible! I expected a Mount Sigh experience,
but an incredible circ-mit-waterfalls and large steep meadows made it
worth the drive. Hiking up many, many (55?) switchbacks I marveled at
the exponentially expanding views of snowy ridgetops and green
valleys. Near the summit I was glad for Mr. Ice Axe, as there was a
steep snowfinger I needed to kick steps across. The exposure on this
trail is exciting, but watch your step! From the summit I saw Tiny
Seattle, Glacier Peak, and many other special friends. Chimney Rock
looks especially forbidding from here.  Nibbling on some stores from
last fall, I began my descent, relaxing only after the snow was
passed. My paws were a blur, and I grew dizzy on the switchbacks. I
crossed the river and reached the car at 6:20 PM. It is 8 PM, I'm back
in the office, nose twitching!



### Mount Si, old trail, 7/4}

I had a few hours in the afternoon, so I went hiking. I'd heard of
"the old trail" up Mount Si, but only knew that it started at the
Little Si trailhead. Hiking up that trail, I took the 2nd right turn
after it leveled out (I should have taken the third!).  Unaware that
I was on the wrong trail, I hiked up to some mossy boulders with bolts
sticking out of the moss. "Crazy climbers", I thought, but the next
joke was on me as I was lured into deep and steep brush by dozens of
flags and pieces of string tied along the trees. "BRH PRJ" said the
flagging. 30 minutes later, I got back on the trail which dropped to a
road. The road then climbed to a scary "Meth lab" looking house. I
heard someone crashing around near the house, so I bushwhacked to the
road higher up, not wishing to disturb someone(thing?). At least the
road kept going up, albeit slowly. Eventually, I hit the old trail!
Boy was I happy! I scurried up the steep switchbacks like a field
mouse, cunningly reaching the main trail mere yards from the
boulder-field. I scrabbled to the tip top summit, dodging falling rocks
and bodies as Mr. Manning suggests. Mountains to the east were socked
in and rainy.  North Bend popped and fizzed through the afternoon, the
celebrations getting underway.  I ran down the trail, and nearly
jumped out of my skin when I saw another person on it at 2000 ft! He
had gotten disoriented, and his legs were tired and sore. Just to be
safe, we stuck together until reaching the paved road. What a great
trail it is, and forgiving of my routefinding errors!


### Mt. Baring hiking, 5/30}

It was a really pretty day, and I had a few hours after work. I
launched a foolhardy plan to climb Mt. Baring! From the trailhead, I
hiked a few yards up the old road to a rugged trail beside a
stream. After 30 minutes of pulling on rotten limbs, skating mossy
rocks and climbing crumbling cliffs I left the stream and hiked a
faint trail into the steep forest. When this was lost under snow, I
continued straight up a wide gully to the ridge crest. That took long
enough that I decided I should make this my high point. I hiked around
for a while and tried to get views of Merchant and Gunn Peaks through
the foliage. The trip down through the stream was most unpleasant!

### Great Northern Slab, 5/??/2002}

Kris's sister was in town for a few days, so we took her climbing on the slab.
We climbed the usual three excellent pitches, and had a great time.
She did so well for her first climb, always smiling!

### Leavenworth climbing, 5/11-12/2002}

Kris and I climbed Midway, the classic route on Castle Rock. Then we
went to the town Maifest for a while, and finished the day with an
evening climb of good ol' Mountaineer's Buttress. The next morning I
got up early to solo the "Tree Route" on Eight-mile Buttress.  I roped
up for the 3rd pitch, a 4-5 inch wide crack which I didn't have any
protection for anyway. There was a fourth pitch, but I had to get
back. We had breakfast, then went on a leisurely hike (the Icicle
Gorge Trail), but because we had to be on the other side of town for a
horse ride, this became an epic! We took a loop trail, expecting it to
be very short. But in the end, lots of running and worrying had to
occur to get us to the horse ranch by 3 pm! Anyway, the horse ride was
pretty awesome, we went up a steep trail with decent views. My horse
tried to eat at every chance, and required stern discipline, which I
believe he secretly craved. Going down was hell, with various muscles
becoming really stiff. We had a great, full weekend together!

### Mount Si, 5/4/2002}

Kris and I did some hiking to the 2.5 mile mark. I carried a heavy
pack to train for a planned alpine climb the next day. But very wintry
weather caused us to cancel this trip. Sniff.

### Rattlesnake Ledge, 4/28/2002}

Kris and I hiked here in the late afternoon, enjoying the view from
the top of the ledge.  The hike is similar in difficulty to Little Si,
but the views much more commanding!  There is a 9.8 mile one way trip
that traverses Rattlesnake Mountain, that would be fun to do sometime.

### Leavenworth Climbing, 4/27/2002}

Peter and I intended to climb Orbit, but it was raining everywhere -
even at Peshastin!  So we climbed in the rain, and had quite an
adventure. This was a fun hodge-podge kind of day, dodging or braving
the rain - whatever it takes to keep climbing!

### Mount Si, 4/19/2002}

Alex and I hiked to the plateau below the haystack before work. We
looked at climbing lines on the Haystack. Despite early promise, the
day had become gray and sullen.


### Wallace Falls, 4/8/2002}

With the time change, it was still light after work! So I went to a new area
for some exercise. I hiked to the upper falls and back, and I enjoyed the trail
quite a bit. I'm surprised to have overlooked this nearby hike for so long.
The trip was 1.5 hours round trip.

### Exit 38, 4/7/2002}

Kris and I climbed a few pitches in the early evening. Fun!

### Index Aiding, 4/2/2002}

Peter and I climbed Iron Horse to the anchors at "Ringing
Flake." Peter led up to the bulge, then came down and belayed me on
the hook move. This was my first time to place a hook, and it was
pretty exciting! The metal hook barely caught on a crystal in the
granite and somehow held body weight. One millimeter to the right or
left, one shift of my weight, and it would come off. I carefully eased
onto it, thankful for the bomber nut placement at my knees. Oh yes, I
was in the top steps of my aiders too - another first! I was pretty
reluctant to climb up on the hook, imagining it pinging off the rock
at any second, sending me on what I hoped would be a short fall. I
felt for the first time what "hard aid" must be like. I became
inclined to gallows humor, and repeatedly warned Peter that I was
going to fall at any second. Scrabbling with my right hand, I found a
pocket for my constant savior - the little yellow alien!  Always a
friend to me, he again proved his worth, fitting snugly in a pocket to
the right of the hook. Moving onto the little cam felt like moving
onto a two bolt belay station. Despite my nervousness, the hook never
budged. Peter cleaned the pitch and said he would hang a truck off
that hook placement. Well...it was scary to me!  The climb finished
with nutting similar to the start (described below). We rapped off and
went to work.

### Little Si, 3/??/2002}

Kris and I hiked to the summit on a moderately sunny day. I brought
rope and rack to try out some climbs on World Wall I. But after
clipping the first bolt of something, the wet and cold caused me to
back off with frozen fingers!


### Index Aiding, 3/24/2002}

I had a few hours to kill in the afternoon, so I went to Index and
solo aid climbed part of the Iron Horse route. I missed the HB Offsets
that Alex and I had last time we were here (two years ago?). But
ordinary nuts worked pretty well too. I didn't bring my hooks with me,
and couldn't find a way to get above the bulge at mid-pitch. I clipped
a bomber nut above two fixed pitons and tried traversing to a crack on
the right, but it was too far away. I didn't see any other options, so
I down aided to the pitons, then rappelled from there. I had to leave
a 'biner, but I'm sure someone took it by now!

### Frenchman's Coulee climbing, 3/17/2002}

Peter Chapman, Dan Smith and I drove out here in snow and hail,
arriving to very cold weather, and colder rock! I led Party in Your
Pants (5.8), blowing on my hands to keep from freezing. Then a nice
fellow named Jack showed up, and while he and Dan climbed other stuff,
Peter and I climbed the first pitch of Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town
(5.8 first pitch). Peter led this, then I climbed a pitch above to the
mesa top that climbed around a column, up a chimney, then up steep
loose face holds. This route is just left of the 2nd pitch of Bill and
Paul's Bogus Adventure, and I'd also rate it 5.6, but very
loose. Next, Peter and I top-roped Air Guitar, a great 5.10a crack. I
managed to climb it without falling, so later I decided to lead it,
but I was sufficiently tired to back off. Then I followed Peter on
Crossing the Threshold (5.8). He led the crack climb in great style. I
led Whipsaw (5.9), a pumpy bolted arete. After Peter followed this, we
top-roped Pony Keg, a 5.10a crack climb just to the left. This was an
excellent climb! Meanwhile, Dan finally got around to climbing 7
Virgins and a Mule, a great 5.7 chimney. It was a great time, many
thanks to Dan for driving our sorry selves out there. Oh yeah, the
weather was fine, sunny and hot in the afternoon!

### Rampart Ridge, 2/9/2002}

Michael R., Aaron H., Joey L. and I drove to Mt. Rainier and snowshoed
on the Rampart Ridge trail. It was the first time
on snowshoes for these three guys, and I used my best whiny teacher's
voice to instruct them in the delicate art of snowshoe travel. We
followed the gentle and mostly packed trail up to a
viewpoint on the ridge, with great scenes of the Tatoosh and
Rainier. I gave Michael my MSR snowshoes and used the enormous
"Tubb's" that he rented.  These things were slipping and sliding all
over. At the end, we sat in a snow covered meadow and talked about the
mountain. Thanks for a great time, guys!

### Snow Creek Wall Recon, 2/3/2002}

![Chris Koziarz on Wedge Mountain}{chriswedge.jpg)

Chris Koziarz and I hiked up to the Snow Creek
Wall, hoping to climb the Country Club Ramp.  However, when we got a
glimpse of the wall through the mist, it was pretty terrifying. We
watched as avalanches scoured the upper ramp. The wall had so much
snow, that even the steep rock of the Shield was white.  Needless to
say, we cached the technical gear, and took our snowshoes up the side
of Wedge Mountain for some exercise. We avoided open slopes, and
climbed in deep snow for a few thousand feet. We ate some lunch on an
outcrop and looked down at the Wall. Much of the snow was melting, and
it looked a lot better. Also, the sun came out to play.  We headed
back to the car and indulged in some "dry tooling" on Mountaineer's
Buttress.  I led an easy pitch, hooking my ice tools onto ledges and
into cracks. Chris led a pitch with some nice ice-tool-in-crack
moves. We hiked down and made the long drive to the West.

### Ice Climbing, 1/29/2002}

Alex Krawarik and I hiked to a short ice climb near an Alpental ski
run.  It was incredibly cold. His hands froze about halfway up, and he
lowered off two screws. Tried again - same thing! I was sure I could
do it. I went up to the same point, and my hands froze! Horrible pain
as they came back to life! Alex set up a top rope while I moaned and
groaned. Alex top roped a really steep bit, and I did a somewhat
easier finish to the anchor. Tough climbing and a cold day!


### Nevada hiking, 1/20/2002}

I had a few hours on a family/business trip to Las Vegas, so I headed
for the Mt.  Charleston area. I figured to hike and probe the snow
line, but couldn't venture into it very far. I had tennis shoes, and a
pair of Kris's socks to serve as "gloves."  I followed the road until
it traversed a north facing slope above the town of
Mt. Charleston. Too snowy and icy. So I went back to the town and
followed my nose up to a trailhead in a neighborhood. Hiking an old
road, I soon entered the wilderness area, and began looking for
something to do. A high peak on my right seemed attractive, but
probably too hard. I kept walking until an obvious ridge led up on the
right.  It looked free of snow and just right for me. I left the trail
and scrambled up the increasingly defined and narrow ridge. I detoured
a steep step on the left, and had to cut steps up a frozen snowfield
with a rock. Then a knife edge section proved very exciting. I didn't
think I should try anything harder than that! But the difficulty eased
off, and soon I was on the summit - 2938 meters high. Looking to my
right I saw I could connect to the first summit I saw, but it would
require a rope. It looked similar to Peshastin Pinnacles climbing over
there. A short rest on the summit, admiring the surrounding views, and
I headed down. I wasn't careful enough on the very rotten rock and
have a few bruises to show for it. On one occasion, I fully weighted a
hold with my foot and it suddenly exploded from the face like a
bomb. I was able to avoid the knife edge ridge with a strange leaning
chimney, and I skipped the lower ridge in favor of a 1000 foot scree
ski, my shoes happily filling with pebbles. 
The peak I climbed is called the
Cockscomb.  I think it was about a 3 mile round trip, with 2000 feet
elevation gain. I hiked from 2:00 pm to 4:20 pm, and the trip from Las
Vegas took 45 minutes each way.
