Short visit to Südtirol. I love that place. First 1500 meters, then, according
to Google, a massive 2200 meter day. There were a lot of ups and downs, but
still, I'm going to discount that to 1800!

First day, a climb of the Hohe Kreuzspitze (2743 m) from the Schutzhütte Hochalm,
with a very friendly owner who told me stories of the region and his family.
I also climbed up the Hochwart (2608 m) on the way down, making for a big day.
It started raining on the descent, and I skipped out on a free yoga class at
the hut in order to get down and find a hotel in Meran.

After a rainy Saturday (very enjoyable, I got some work done), I headed up
early Sunday morening from Velloi to the Gasthaus Steinegg along the Hans Frieden Felsenweg,
then up and over to the Mutkopf (1664 m), and into the Spronsertal.
Some cake at the Oberkaseralm, then to the beautiful Mückenlack, the Grünsee
and the Langsee. From here over to the Hochgangscharte (2444 m), then very steeply down
that to the Schutzhaus Hochgang then for a beer at the very pleasant Leiteralm
above Velloi.

Some ladies hiking at the Pfitschlacke, just after the Pfitscher Jöch (2150 m).
