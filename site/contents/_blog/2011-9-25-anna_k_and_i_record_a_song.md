Back in July, Kris, the boys and I went on a long hike in Italy. The first
night we stayed at the Grasleitenhütte, beautifully nestled in the Rosengarten
Dolomites. We met Anna K., a student who was spending the summer there.
She was playing guitar and singing in the common room. I played along for
a while, and we agreed to meet one day to play more music. Amazingly, that
happened on Saturday, when she and a friend Julia came to Munich for Oktoberfest.
I had a terrible cold, so I had to keep my distance, but we managed to
record Anna playing guitar and singing, and Julia played the intro on guitar
as well.
  
  
That was a fun meeting! Also fun to hear about Julia's adventures as a
firefighter (more to come I'm sure). Later, I added two more guitar parts,
and sadly had to throw away Anna's part which was great but I recorded
it way too loud. Julia's part is just too quiet, darn it. Play louder girl!
So what survives is Anna's vocals, a rhythm guit"\>Hallelujah, by Leonard
Cohen, from the Shrek movie.
  
  
Big thanks to Julia and Anna for stopping by. Hope to meet again sometime.
Anyway here is the song:

If you click on the song to go to the soundcloud site you can download
the mp3\. Seems like great surroundings produce great people :).
