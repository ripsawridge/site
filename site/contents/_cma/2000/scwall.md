May 20-21, 2000

Steve and I climbed the route White Slabs
(5.7, 4 pitches) on the Snow Creek Wall.  We wanted to continue to the top of
the wall via a route called the Umbrella Tree (5.7), but couldn't find a tree,
an umbrella, or rock we felt led anywhere but to being scared. If you've climbed
this route, let me know, we just couldn't figure it out from the descriptions.


So we rappelled from the Country Club Ramp, deciding to go down our
route. On the first double rope rappel, the rope got stuck in a
crack. I reascended, using a TibLoc for a self-belay. Moving the rope
out of the path of this crack was good enough. We did two more double
rope rappels, arriving at our gear at the base. This was a good climb,
with good protection. We built only one gear anchor, otherwise we had
trees.


We zoomed down the trail, then 1500 feet up the other side of the Icicle valley
to climb "Givler's Crack," a great 5.7+ I had heard about. We had no idea it
would be so hard to get to. The route we took to get to the base was 4th class
in places.  Going down, we found the trail, and it was much easier. We did the
climb in one pitch, starting from the tree on the right, and 15 feet above the
5.8 direct start.  We spent 20 minutes wondering if we should just bail, due to
impending rain and darkness. But once roped up, and staring up at the beautiful
line, I had to go for it! I knew Steve would kill me if a downpour started while
we climbed!

Exposed and tricky face moves led me to the crack, then a bomber flake
"thank god" hold.  I was hand-jamming for all I was worth, and
plugging a bomber nut or cam in regularly.  I don't think I've ever
placed so much gear, and I was really happy that a good range of sizes
were accepted. Some of the placements had awkward stances, and the
clouds coming in didn't help much. The pitch was long. There was one
place on low angle terrain near the end where I had to down-climb twice
to free the rope from a constriction it kept getting into. I was
careful to avoid that again, and soon I was belaying Steve.  He
enjoyed the climb a lot, finding it easier than he thought it would
be. The appearance of this climb is classic, and it does look hard.


There were a few drops of rain, but the deluge never came. In growing
darkness we sped down the rough trail to the car.


We got an excellent spaghetti dinner in town, and went back out to the
canyon to sleep. We wanted to bivy near the Snow Lakes parking lot,
but a heavy ranger presence scared us away.  We went to the Bridge
Creek Campground, and I asked a partying family if we could sleep in a
corner of their plot. They couldn't believe we didn't have a tent,
thought we were crazy.  But they were really nice, and happy to
share. The teenage girls had an odd habit of screaming piercingly
around midnight though, followed by giggling. No one took any notice.


Back up the Snow Lakes trail-head in the morning, feeling pretty tired
from the day before.  We didn't expect to do so much "hiking" on our
"climbing" weekend. After a lot of scrambling, we reached the base of
Satellite, 
or so we thought. Steve got the lead, a mossy, scary crack
by a greasy smooth slab of granite. The first crux was pulling over a
shrub in the crack.  The second was higher, with bad gear below, and
thin handholds. He built an anchor in a dihedral under an
overhang. This was a tough lead, probably 5.7 and dirty.  I got the
easy work of scrambling left, up and left in a low 5th-class
gully. Decent rock and occasional shrubs and slings were my world. I
topped out on a small buttress, building a low-quality anchor. I could
see we must be off route. To my left were easy gullies. To my right
was a grim scene of overhangs.  The route must be far to the right,
where I couldn't see. Steve ran it out up the gullies, then I did the
same, finally connecting to the descent trail. We were pretty tired,
and ready to go home. Two climbers came down from the wall, raving
about Outer Space. We followed them down the stressful loose
terrain. I was so tense for some reason that my stomach started
hurting. At one point, I narrowly avoided a fall. Thankfully, Steve
led the way and I didn't have to think about route-finding.


We got some great mountain goat pictures at our gear cache, and Steve
figured out that we should have started a mere 30 feet to the
right. We continued down, going too far and ending up in an awful
dirt/charred tree corridor, half falling for 300 feet. We had to climb
up a bit, then were able to take the trail down from the wall, across
the creek, and to the car, 2 miles away.


This was a tiring weekend. But rewarding. We got more 5.7's under our
belts, and we learned something about the Snow Creek Wall. Lesson:
don't attempt the descent in the dark! It's hard enough when feeling
fresh in the daylight. If it were dark, I think I'd just sit on top
for the night...


Steve's Notes
-----------

On pitch 3 I looked down to find a tiny, bright
green frog hitching a ride on the toe of my climbing shoe.  It was
hard to figure out how he came to be there, 250 feet up a dry and
dusty wall and at least 500 more feet up from the creek.  Reluctantly
I shooed him back onto the rock.  In the interest of the purest
climbing ethics, I just could not allow him to use me as "aid" on his
supposed free climb...


I walked up to a large group in the campground to beg for enough
space to lay out our sleeping bags and they asked me if I belonged to
the Mountaineers organization.  Wanting to make a good impression, I
said, "I'm not a member, but I sure buy a lot of your books!"
Apparently they were impressed enough to offer us space they had
reserved in another campground up the road.


I was a bit apprehensive starting up the dihedral.  The portion
we could see was not too difficult, maybe 5.5.  I should have realized
that this was not the Satellite route since the crack was entirely
filled with moss, so that I had to dig out the moss with my nut tool
in order to make each pro placement.  We had heard that the route was
not climbed often, so maybe it had filled in during the last few
years.  Despite the moss the pro was excellent, except near the top.
Except for the moss and the fiendish bush growing out of the crack,
the climbing was very enjoyable, but got more difficult (about 5.7)
and less protectable toward the top as the crack became shallow.
Fortunately I was able to get to the top of the dihedral and onto a
ledge for the belay, though it took a lot of time digging crud out of
crack in order to construct a solid gear anchor.


A highlight of the trip was the friendly mountain goat.  We met
him briefly on the first day before descending the climber's trail to
the creek.  On the second day, he spent quite a lot of time with us,
following us as we tried to find the start of the route and greeting
us again after we had descended.  I was jealous of the way he flitted
about on the slabs and loose rock.  He was clearly the master of the
4th class domain.
