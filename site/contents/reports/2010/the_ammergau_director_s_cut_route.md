I enjoyed a great hike yesterday, getting the idea from Summitpost [here](http://www.summitpost.org/the-ammergau-seven-summits-or-the-director-s-cut/523264).
I headed out in tennis shoes, confident that the recent foehn wind had
melted the considerable snowfall from the latter part of October. Parking
at the wrong trailhead, I spent 20 annoying minutes walking on the flats
outside of Graswang to get to the right place.

As I listened to interesting music, I quite enjoyed the hike up the Kuhalpenbach.
After about 500 meters of elevation gain, I reached a road and walked east
on it for a while, before leaving it for the hike up to the Hasenjoechl.
Now I'd gained the ridge of the "Director's Cut." I would traverse this
from this point in a wide clockwise rotation of about 270 degrees back
to Graswang, bagging 8 named summits along the way.
  
  
It worked really well. I only encountered some tedious sections of snow
at the Vorderer Felderkopf. Beyond that it was a beautiful fall day, with
plenty of dry, brown grassy slopes. However the wind was quite strong a
lot of the time.

I saw my first people below the Geissprungkopf, and then a continue stream
of folks. It seems like a lot of people hike the three named summits on
the western side of the great arcing ridge.
  
  
Back at the car at 2:45 pm, I realized that I could have easily climbed
the entire ridge, throwing in the Ochsensitz, Ziegelspitz and Notkarspitze,
certainly doable with another 1.5 hours of travel, and a bike shuttle to
Ettal for the start. I'll do this next time, having already proposed the
name: the "Extended Director's Cut." :D
