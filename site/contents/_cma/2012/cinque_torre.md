My old friend Aidan was in town for an interesting filming project. We
went to the Dolomites and had time in between work on the film to do a
little bit of climbing and scrambling. First up, was the classic climb
"Via Miriam" (UIAA V), on the South Summit of Torre Grande in the Cinque
Torri Dolomites above Cortina.

The first pitch is a bit polished, and rather steep. Then a spectacular
traverse goes around to the left, and another sustained grade V pitch follows.
After this a steep but easy bit of chimney climbing, and a scramble to
the summit. It was great to finally climb this route, I'd heard of it for
a long time.

Later, after dinner, I hiked up alone to the Nuavalu Hut, and met the
owner, a very interesting woman named Joanne. She was originally from Vancouver
B.C., but had lived in Cortina now for 40 years. I walked down as darkness
fell.
  
  
Later, one afternoon, we went to climb "Via Finlandia" (VI+), a steep
route on a vertical yellow wall. Aidan started on the first pitch, a sustained
and somewhat intimidating grade VI corner crack. He wasn't feeling great
about it so then I went up and climbed to the anchors. Whew...exciting
pitch! The anchor is in a spectacular location, right in the middle of
a vertical yellow wall, with an overhanging traverse to follow. And the
climbing on the pitch was wonderful. The protection was a mix of bolts,
cams and nuts over the 40 meter length. Aidan came up and we decided that
to continue was too hard for our blood. So we rapped off and invented a
crazy plan to go climb the Hexenstein. I didn't want to mess with the car
and roads, so I argued to just set off across country to reach the Falzarego
Pass and our route, with the gear that we have. Aidan thought that was
pretty dumb, so we compromised: I walked, he drove!

My walk over was a fun adventure. I started on trail then cut across perpendicular
bedding planes with some 3rd class downclimbing to reach another trail
that led to a lake, and eventually the pass. I'd promised to be there in
an hour, but it was at least 1.5 hours...oops!
  
  
We hiked up to the start of the climb in sometimes-heavy afternoon showers.
By the time we began climbing, it was over. We climbed very easily in several
pitches up the south arete, finally ending up at a spectacular little grade
IV+ crack that was the icing on the cake for the route. Aidan led this
then brought me to the summit.

We hiked down in interesting war ruins, that I didn't remember seeing
when I was here on a rainy day with Dan P. 4 years ago.

Another day, after doing some easy climbing for Aidan's project, we went
and climbed "Via Olga" (V+), a short 3 pitch route on the West Summit of
Torre Grande. Quite sustained corner climbing marked the first pitch, and
the second had some short strenuous moves to gain a pillar atop a chimney.
From there, easy climbing led to the summit. This was great!

After a beautiful evening sleeping in a meadow, we finished our duties
for the project, and returned to Munich, intending to stop and climb on
the Martinswand on the way. Alas, the north was too rainy. But we did find
some dry rock at the Frauenwasserlwand. We climbed a 6, 6+,7- line. Aidan
led the 7- slab very easily, and I, wanting to work on my slab technique
top-roped it a few times. He led part of a grade 7 slab on the left, but
heavy rain came and we had to scramble to collect our gear and make two
rappels to the base of the short wall.

Thanks Aidan for a great visit and some fun climbing!
