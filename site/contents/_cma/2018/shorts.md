### Wendelstein

_April 29, 2018_

Barbara, Mara and I hiked up and down on a leisurely Sunday. It was great! But wow, pretty
crowded. We had a nice talk in the meadow after a drink at the house. We left the summit alone
this time, as the vast hordes of people were a bit much. Mara was maximally cute, and so was
my girl.

Mara just found some water.

Barbara didn't like this wet terrain.

Tired ol' Mara, sleeping all evening.

### Kranzhorn

_April 15, 2018_

Barbara and I hiked up Kranzhorn really quickly. But I got a headache, probably dehydrated
from the day on the Martinswand Saturday with Vaclav. And she pushed herself too hard in
the last hundred meters and felt bad. We sped down the steep trail, and poor Barbara had
such leg pain that she was even limping! _Arme Frau!_ Ach. My headache was terrible.
What a tough time!

### Isar with Barbara

_April 8, 2018_

I wanted to show Barbara the long Isar run I did a week before. She was initially
sad, because she wanted to go to high mountains, but I thought there was too
much snow for the highest fun. I finally won her over though...running through
the woods up and down with Mara was beautiful. And the river was fantastic.
Another magical day with my girl, after a wonderful dinner and night.
I'm a happy man.

Colorful Frau, running 15 km in sandals? Okay!

These woods amaze me. Beautiful.

### Ruine Stein

_April 6, 2018_

I brought the boys down on the Steg trail, but we stopped and explored the ruined
castle at Stein. Very interesting place, long an administrative center about 600 years
ago. It's on the side of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere. Whats up with that?

We hung out a while, did some pushups, and walked back up the mountain for cake.

We ate dinner where Sigmund Freud hung out. Bitchin!

Cooking in our _Ferienwohnung_.

### Steg

_April 5, 2018_

Wieder von unserer Ferienwohnung in Klobenstein hinunter zu Steg. Diesmal,
mit einem Umweg an der Rückkehr zum Lengmoos, um ein Radler an einem Tisch
drausend am Cafe zu geniessen. Die Sonne ist raus geworden, und der Schlern
war ein schneereiches Traum in spielende Wolken.

### Steg

_April 3, 2018_

Ich war interessant, von Klobenstein zum Eisacktal abzusteigen. Dann wieder
aufzusteigen, natürlich. Ich dachte, die Jungs waren OK allein für ein Paar
Stunden. Zuerst, der Zaberbach entlang nach Siffian. Da gibt es eine alte
Kirche, St. Peter. Auch ein nervöse schwarze Hund hart dabei. Besser früh
zu pfeifen, so er bekommt keine Überraschung!

Immer steil führt der Weg, nicht weit von die Ruine Stein, dann bei die letzte
Bauernhöfe, endlich under der Brennerautobahn. Am Ende bin ich den Eisack
an eine holze Brücke überquert. Ich habe meine Freundin über Liebe getextet,
aber die Worte geht irgendwie falsch, so sie hat mir gefragt, nicht weiter
zu texten. Na ja! Als ich bei Stein gegangen war, dachte ich über das Leben
der mittelaltischen Leute. Diese Leben waren kleiner aber grosser. Oberflächlich
hatten sie nicht so viele Fähigkeiten als uns, aber wenn ich tiefer denke,
und meine Vorstellung benutzte, sehe ich gut, daß sie sehr unabhängig waren.
Ich würde mehr unbrauchbar als ein kleines Kind in ihrer Welt sein.

950 Meter Höhenunterschied.

### Hoher Fricken

_March 30, 2018_

I was back about a month after hiking up with Peter, enjoying the steep trail
up beside the great waterfalls. Amazingly, the snow depth was
about the same. I could go a bit further without snowshoes, owing to some deep tracks
that were easier to rebuild and punch through than to make new ones. It had been
at least a week since anyone went up, and higher, I was tempted to think that the
remnant tracks were only those left by Peter and I...they were mere dimples in
the snow which had a solid base under several layers of fresher snow. Rebuilding
those was plenty of work, especially near the summit.

I went down towards the Esterbergalm, coming pretty close to it as I descended near
ski tracks, before cutting westward to the tight pass at 1279 m that would lead me
back to Farchant.

### Buchenhain by bike

Elijah and I went for a bike ride to Buchenhain and did some bouldering.
What an amazing place. Elijah also took some pictures of Legos, which came out good!

### Kruezeck

_March 4, 2018_

Evening trip up on skis. Very dark mountain. Beautiful ski down a black run.
Yes!

### Kreuzeck

_March 1, 2018_

Jaro, Camillo, Andreas and I skied up after work. A cold but beautiful evening with
a full moon. It was our first time up here. The ski route took us through a special
tunnel built just for ski touring folk! Pretty hilarious.

We got dinner on the way down at the Restaurant Kreuzalm in the ski area, which was
packed with the ski touring crowd. The way down was fast and icy, but nice.


### Brauneck

_February 18, 2018_

Quick run up in the afternoon. 1.5 hours, I was faster because I didn't take
the slow way around to the Florianshütte.

### Brauneck

_February 8, 2018_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck this morning in light snow.
I was pretty sweaty because I wanted to keep my jacket on in the snow.
Hmpf! Great run down, one lame fall where I hurt my thumb, a bit.
900 meters up/down.
