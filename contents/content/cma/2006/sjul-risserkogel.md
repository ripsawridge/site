### Risserkogel hiking
_July, 2006_

On a rainy Saturday I needed some exercise, so I hiked through light rain up a
trail on the south side of the Risserkogel peak south of Tegernsee. Quite
pleasant, despite the rain, and some really interesting steep grassy hills all
around me. I reached a hut at a meadow, stocked by goats and a few people. At
that moment, the rain started coming down really hard. I looked at my watch,
and saw I was out of time. I headed down.
