It's been hard for me to understand why I should stop writing about this.
But I might be starting to get it.

I keep having epiphanies in meditation. And then I scramble to my desk to write
them down. I'm somehow thinking that the world is interested in this. Why?
I apparently can't tell where I end and the world begins. I imagine that
everybody must be feeling what I'm feeling. And that my hastily scribbled
thoughts will be useful to them.

This self is a kind of program with a bug in it. How can I convince the program
in terms that it understands to let go of this activity. I'm suspecting that
the activity is a compensation mechanism which actually has the effect of
keeping state at a local maximum. If the compensation is no longer performed,
the system may attain a new state.

Terms that the program might understand:

* No one cares -- really! Not because they are fools, but because your
vision of the good is intensely personal. You have this north star called
"enlightenment." Others have something similar, but it's far more likely
that your words are in the way of their vision rather than aiding them.
They might squint at your words a bit and then say "no that's that it at all."
So you're adding to the debries of the world (and with ChatGPT, the world is
bracing for a DELUGE of inane words already).

* Even worse, someone may care. Suppose someone appears and says "WOW YOU HAVE
IT! Thank you for finding truth!" Uh oh. What do I write next? I might disappoint
them. I might try to delight them (and what about my own actual journey
at this point?), and face the catastrophe of really letting them down with
some acute angle in my thought they didn't expect to see. If someone cared,
I'd be worse off.

* Your efforts are tolerated. This is the sad truth of things. I find my
epiphanies so important, so interesting...but the ones who actually love me
are just swerving their cars slightly to avoid having to tell me that it
is rude to litter the highway with debries.

Are those enough reasons to quit writing about this? If spiritual authorities
who insist on silence don't convince you, maybe those dashes of cold water
above will.

Haha...and so...I grandly announce to a breathless world: I now cease from
writing about spirit, about yoga about meditation about Jesus about
consciousness about...(you know, the thing).

Hiking, music, stuff like that. Those are cool things, and I'll want to
remember certain things about them, so I'll do that.
