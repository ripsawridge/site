As snow begins to blanket the mountains, I'm on the lookout for remaining
snow-free south faces that conserve precious sunlight and allow me to pretend
it's still summertime. It looked like the combo of Ackerlspitze and Maukspitze
might make for a great day -- soon I was walking up and admiring the
uncanny reef of the eastern Wilder Kaiser, with its toothsome spires
over forest and meadow. A particular focal point was the high, rather broad
ridge of the Östliche Hochgrubachspitze, scene of a wonderful day with
Vaclav in 2018. The ridge is called the "Riegelekante."

Looking up to technical terrain from the Östliche Hochgrubachkar.

In general, the Westliche Hochgrubachspitze looks more interesting, with a much
sharper looking clean ridge cutting southeast from the summit. Anyway, it was
the clearest view I'd yet had of that complex wall of peaks.

Before I knew it, I was pushing up through alp under the Ackerlhütte, then further
in warm sun up to the Östliche Hochgrubachkar, a pleasant high point for the
hiker unwilling to begin the "use of hands" work that lay higher. I was
willing, however, so I started up the wall on an ingenious little trail
with occasional metal handholds. After about 20 minutes, I reached another
basin called the Niedersessel, where a steep route (let's call it what it
is, a rock climb!) goes up to the Ackerlspitze, and a less imposing but
still very steep trail sets off for the Maukspitze.

Here I ate some chapati and hummus.

What a vast underwater complex it once was!

Looking down on the Ackerlschneid, my goal is to reach it again safely!

The wild Griesner Kar.

Taking the steeper way, I enjoyed the climbing, even though I used the metal
bits on exposed traverses (I've gotten older!). Sometimes I had to walk through
deep snowdrifts, which was slow and unpleasant. I reached the Ackerlschneid, the
saddle between the two great peaks, and set off for the Ackerlspitze. Pretty soon
the going got slow because of slippery snow. The trail here is really something.
Bits of vegetation, dirt, shattered rock and the occasional solid rock, making
a 200 millimeter wide "trail" up unforgiving, scruffy terrain. The snowbanks
which nestled on the face usually made their homes in the trail. They required
care to navigate, and I wished for sturdier boots. I was following tracks of one
individual who must have gone up the day before or hours before, since they
hadn't returned and I thought it unlikely that they would descend the snowy
north side to the Griesner Kar.

Finally I was on the ridge with gorgeous views down to that Kar, and getting
worried about the final scramble in snow. Walking on the snowed-up ridge felt
trecherous, and it didn't take long to decide to give it up in order to preserve
enough time to hike up the Maukspitze. Descending was quite slow back to the
Ackerlschneid, then I made more rapid progress traversing with a bit of up
and down across to the bulk of the Maukspitze. I crossed through the
*Torbogen*, a car-sized space under a natural rock arch that marked a key
passage. Moments later, I stood on top.

Ach, time to turn around without the summit!

From the Maukspitze, looking back over the time-place of my mid-morning hours.

Over the previous 48 hours, I re-read an old story from my youth: *Ghost Story*,
by Peter Straub. Really entertaining! But my perspective on it is so different now.
I kept asking: why didn't these frightened old (and some young) men turn to God?
It never even occurred to them. Though they were dealing with a supernatural
monster that reveled in death and cruelty. My feeling about such monster stories
is that for all their horror, they "prove" supernatural life. After all, if a
being lives for thousands of years, ruffles easily through the minds of humans,
shape-shifts from bird to lynx to man, doesn't it rehabilitate the words of the
Bible in a modern age?

And in there, the answer is prayer and contemplation of God. For this invokes Him.
And dark forces scatter from such light -- they have so many more places they can
go to find victims in the shadows! Yes, they are insane, but they are not without
a compartmentalized logic. (For it is insanity to believe you can live separate
from God -- you, yes, even you vampires, are made of Him).

Sigh...so these poor old folks are harrowed to their graves, hypnotized by the
darkness of it all. Never thinking even once that the appearance of the monster
suggests the likelyhood of angels.

Anyway! I started down, first to the appropriately named *Flachschneide* (flat place).
Then quite slowly through the snowdrifts and ragged sections of trail back to the
Niedersessel. On the way, I saw a tiny black speck above the Ackerlschneid and took
a picture. It was the person who had been ahead of me on the way up the Ackerlspitze.
He was moving slowly down the snowed-up ridge. I was glad to know all was well.
Further down, I saw a young woman in trail running gear moving rapidly up the steep
trail and said hello.

She would run by me 2 hours later as I approached the car, presumably after hiking up
the Maukspitze -- amazing!


I stopped for a drink at the Ackerlhütte, then ground out the descent in pleasant late
afternoon sun, then shady forest. It was a good day.
