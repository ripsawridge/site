First a hike up to Oberbozen and the nearby summit. Lots of strong hikers
out this morning blowing past me. 1000 meters up and down.

Next day, a hike up from Vilpian on a steep way to reach the top-station
of the Seilbahn Mölten. Nice chat with an older man here about the lack
of snow. I walked up through Schlaneid to the St. Ulrich restaurant by
a lake above the town. 1100 meters up and down.

of existence to be born into bondage. But is this really so bad? It is
simply a fact. The joy of living comes from elsewhere.*
