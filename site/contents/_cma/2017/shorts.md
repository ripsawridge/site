### Company ski-day
_February 24, 2017_
A fun time! I skinned up on my touring skis to the Hoehe Salve summit,
about 1100 meters up from the base at Söll. I ran into Yang and Ulan
on the way up, which was fun. Later, at lunch I couldn't find anyone
from the group. Oh well! I decided to spend the afternoon hiking down
and back up from Brixen im Thale. Since I had tennis shoes in my backpack,
I was able to hide my ski gear then walk about 500 meters down a road
and snow-free slopes. I did some meditation in the sun.

After all this, I hurried back, somewhat worried that the lifts would
close before I could make it to the Stocklalm on the north side of the
peak. Happily I just made it! The black runs coming down from the summit
were really excellent -- the snow good _firn_, very much spring conditions
(in the old days).

Hilarious dinner with the team. Lots of funny philosophical discussions.
Always tinged with the absurd, the way I like it best. :)

### Wallberg
_February, 2017_
Hannes, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg after work. It was quite warm!
It hadn't snowed in a long time. We saw no one. The slope was so icy I
found it irritating to use skins, so I put my skis on my back and walked.
The other guys did okay with skis. Tonight we went to the true summit.
Gorgeous view all around. The trip down was good, and the dinner
excellent. We were all hungry!

### Wallberg
Jaro, Marcel, Camillo and I skied up Wallberg after work. It was very cold,
and we had lots of snow. Fun! Jaro wanted to skin right up the steepest
part of the slope, and we did this (though I lost patience and made a
boot track). Above this initial steep section, the skinning up was perfect.
On top there was a strong wind. There was a beautiful light in the distance,
where a cloud spilled over a ridge with a lighted hut on it.

We really enjoyed the ski down. We saw many parties coming up.
W00t!

### Brauneck
_January 7, 2017_
I was back two days later; high avalanche danger kept me out of the higher
mountains. It's simply because the uptrack is such an enjoyable trail, I didn't
mind skiing on a commercial ski mountain. I repeated what Jaro and I did
exactly, but on the way down I stopped at a strategic point where the uphill
track has two variations. The one Jaro and I did was to skin steeply up
along the east side of a hill and the left side of a little-used piste,
and then follow a steep and narrow trail in forest until making a long
traverse west near the crest of the hill to a saddle above the Florianhütte.
But the other route traverses below this hill on the south to reach the
hut itself, climbing very slowly, and then rejoining the other route at
the saddle. So I applied my skins again (elevation here is 1100 meters)
and went to the Florianhütte and from there to the summit. 

This gave me a total elevation gain for the day of 1300 meters, which was
fine. I was in fact, well-pleased.

### Brauneck
_January 5, 2017_

Jaro and I skied up Brauneck today from the Wegscheid Draxlhang lift. Kris
and I taught the boys to ski here, it brought back memories. Today, Jaro
and I followed the ski touring trail, which was excellent...it largely
avoided the piste in favor of quiet trails in forest. Also, they were
trails and not roads, which I really appreciated.
