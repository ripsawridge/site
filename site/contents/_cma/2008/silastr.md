Silas Wild and his daughter Jen were coming to Austria for weeks of
skiing. I knew Silas from slide shows back in Seattle, and from reading
John Roper's entertaining story about the first ascent of the
``Wildhair Crack" in the Picket Range. He is a spare, powerful ball of
energy, and it was awesome to have the chance to go skiing with two
generations of Wilds.

They had been warming up in the Stubai and Karwendel Mountains around
Innsbruck, where they stayed with a friend. I drove down Saturday
morning, and after an enlightening talk with their friend ``Wolfi," who
has climbed every single thing in the Alps (seemingly!) we drove down
to the Dolomites for the weekend. The forecast wasn't great, but it
promised more sun down south than north of the alpine crest.

Silas is thinking about bringing folks over here for ski tours when he
retires, so Jen and I had to go along with his plan to stop at every
tourist office along the way and paw excitedly through the full-color
brochures showing the attractions of each area. We liked how in the
paintings of the mountains around a town, showing the different ski
lifts and trails, the town seemed to be the center of the
universe. And there was never information about the next town 5 miles
away. 

We drove up the narrow road to the Platz Wiesen (*Prato Piazza*), 
which
has an impressive view of the Hohe Gaisl across the valley. We put on
our skis and started skinning up the Duerrenstein (2839 meters), at a
steady pace that nonetheless allowed us to admire the Dolomite
scenery, which is so varied and exciting. I got to ask Jen what it was
like growing up with a mountain-goat for a Dad. Near the top, the wind
really picked up and the clouds came down. Jen still doesn't
understand this peak-bagging motivation (or understands it too well!)
so she thought about waiting for us, but it was just too cold to stand
still! So we all went to the summit, enjoying a narrow ridge 5 minutes
from the top. We wished the weather was better, but we did get to see
the Drei Zinnen for a moment before the clouds lowered. 

I kept the Wilds in front of me for most of the descent, trying to
pick up tips by mimicking their expert turns. The snow was pretty icy,
but the 950 meters down to the car went very quickly. We felt really
good, but couldn't see anything else to occupy us here for the
afternoon, so we decided to drive down to Brunico and stay there for
the night. It was great fun seeing Silas so excited at the cute little
villages. He collected another 3 dozen pamphlets for light reading
later. We stayed outside of town in a village called Sankt Martin, and
though it was snowing heavy flakes, I felt energetic enough to go
jogging for an hour up the forested peak behind the town. This was a
great mini-adventure in itself. When the trail quit going up, I set
off straight up the slope, with root and branch for hand-holds, then
following game trails in the forest. It was kind of a magical forest,
with soft heather underfoot, and evening light filtering through the
trees, along with the occasional snowflake. Without time to reach the
top, I practiced my route-finding skills by returning along ledges and
ridges the way I came, at one point startling a deer.

We had a great dinner, though because it was Good Friday, they served
no meat! The restaurant was right across the street from the town
church, and we wondered if that played a role or not!

In the morning, we drove through St. Vigil then up the long Rautal
valley to the end at Pederu. The cliffs on the north side of the road
were amazing, and beautiful with their new dusting of snow which
contrasted nicely with the brilliant blue sky. It would be a perfect
day!

We skied up into the Fanes Valley (*Valun de Fanes*), with the views
just knocking us out. We didn't have a map or a guidebook (Silas had a
lot of full-color pamphlets, but he didn't get where he is by spending
money needlessly!) so we were kind of surprised how long it took to
get back in to the Lavarela Hut. But we had to take lots of pictures
and look at more slopes to ski on future trips. At the Hut, Silas was
so impressed that he planned to stay for a few days, while I took Jen
back to Munich for her flight home the next day. Then he'd hitchhike
home, or some other scheme which just made Jen roll her
eyes. Sometimes Dads are embarrassing! But the hut was full, so Silas
had to whip on his skis and go check the Fanes hut for a
vacancy. Waiting in the sun, Jen got a tan and I got a sunburn. By the
time he got back it was well after 11...pretty late to start a long
ski tour! "Wolfi would kill us, don't tell him!" implored Silas.

We were making for a peak called Zehner, across a long high plateau
with little lakes. Jen decided to hang back, so it was just us old
bergstormers. Silas kept telling me to go on ahead, living as he was
in some alternate reality where I had the strength of 10. But soon we
were occupied with a cloud of snow, dropping in on us from the west,
and obscuring the impressive slabs of the Neunerspitze on our
right. These slabs look out of place in the Dolomites, seemingly
transplanted from Yosemite. They offer 6-7 pitches of excellent
climbing, and I hope to come back for them.

The clouds dropped and lifted repeatedly, happily tracks and wide open
slopes kept us on the right path. We slowed down a bit on the final
slopes of the peak, entertaining ourselves by speaking only German,
which would have sounded hilarious to real German speakers. But they
had all left, we seemed to be the last people on the peak. At the ski
depot, we looked up at the intimidating climb to the summit, which
we'd call impossible without the iron cable to make it easier. With
cloud on the left, and blue sky on the right, it beckoned us
aboard. Swinging up the occasionally vertical ridge from cable to
cable, we were breathing a little hard, now just above 3000 meters.

"Should we head down?" I said after 2 minutes in the biting
wind. "Hell yes," said Silas with a backward glance - he was already
starting down! We had to be careful on the icy rock, but soon we were
back at our skis, where Silas led the way to little powder stashes on
the face. Unfortunately we were a bit late, and the snow had started
to develop a crust. It was still a great ski down. At one point
though, I hit a rock which sent me flying. My face hit the snow so
hard, that it froze painfully. I fumbled in my pack for some dry
clothes to wipe my face off, mewling piteously all the while. Then we
went down to the plateau, and had to travel fast in the driving snow
before tracks were obliterated. Back near the hut, Silas, the old
wizard, led me over some small cliff jumps which took me by
surprise. I cratered comically, having to laugh a little bit. We
stumbled into the hut, semi-frozen, where Jen was worried about us.

"We're fine!" we said. Well mostly! Silas had an old injury flare up
and bother him. So when the hut owner offered him a ride down in his
snow-cat, he couldn't refuse. Jen and I wanted to ski, so we did,
though rocks in the road near the bottom did some damage to our skis. 

Sadly our weekend was over, but I enjoyed the company so much. It made
me look forward to when my kids are Jen's age. They can drag me up
mountains and we'll have many shared experiences to laugh about.

Thanks to Silas and Jen for a great time!
