It's pretty odd, hardly anyone here ever sees the Kontrol, or police of
the subway that occasionally check to see that your card is valid. But
I was accosted last night and again today! Last night I stayed kind of
late at work and was coming home, listening to my iPod on a nearly empty
train, when a tap on the shoulder got me to turn and see a black-clad serious
looking man holding some kind of ID badge. I fumbled around and found my
card...no problem.

Today is a holiday ("All-Saints Day", or "All Souls Day"). I slept in,
then went for a bike ride to visit our apartment in Lehel. I needed to
be back by 2 pm because Neal was making some pizza and it would be ready
then. The weather finally took the turn for the worse that everyone was
expecting, but I didn't mind the gray skies as long as the rain held off.
Traveling south, then east through Westpark, I was impressed by the hills,
forest paths, golden leaves and green lawns of the park. There was a little
pagoda by a still lake. A half mile away there was a bigger lake with a
restaurant and some geese. Eventually I came out and travelled up Lindwurmstrasse
which brought me to Sendlinger Tor, a tower that marks the southwest entrace
to the inner city. I hoped a little stand would be open to buy sausages
in the Viktualin Markt, but everything was closed, darn. I just had time
to ride by our place on Bruderstrasse then I turned back, following my
nose back to Lindwurmstrasse and Westpark.
  
  
I got back and Neal hadn't even started on the pizza, too wrapped up in
an Internet chat (kids these days...). So we hung out a while, then ate.
I took off again around 4:00 on the bike, oddly excited about seeing terrain
south of the main city.
  
  
But it was raining harder so I thought I'd relax and just wander a bit.
That became harder though because I rode aimlessly onto Fürstenriederstraße
and pretty soon recognized that it headed due south. I went by a cemetary
called Waldfriedhof, and there were many people going in and out. I could
see little candles on many of the graves inside. All Souls Day is a time
when people prepare the graves of loved ones for winter, with candles and
flowers. The cemetary was large, and I rode by on the outside for well
over a mile. Before long I was on a bike path with a sign: "Starnberg:
16 km". Well Starnberg has a lake called the Starnbergsee. That made me
think of the mountains so I thought "I should go there." I stopped to reconfigure
my gear, taking off the jacket and hat, putting the lights on the bike
and getting the iPod ready for a long trip. The ride was simple and nice.
First I passed a large forest with little dirt roads going in. Then the
country opened up into farm and horse country, very pretty. I was really
getting wet though. It had started to rain lightly, and the lower half
of my jeans were already soaked through. As I wondered about the wisdom
of going all the way out to Starnberg and back I was suddenly flying through
the air when my bike hit some kind of wet leaf. "Ahhhhgh!" I said, landing
heavily on my back. Already bruised from an accident in the mountains Sunday
I just had to shake my head. "I need my wife," I thought.
  
  
I collected my iPod (happily undamaged) from the middle of the road, and
waved on the concerned car that slowed down. Grimly I got back on and kept
going, all you can do after a pratfall I guess!
  
  
Okay, once I was at Starnberg, I was so miserable and soaked, that I made
right for the S-bahn station. Squealching inside, I puzzled out what tickets
I'd need to buy to get me and my bike back near home. It was a bit complex,
so I probably "overbought:" I had to have a ticket for my bike, and a ticket
for myself, each with a different number of zones because I already have
a zone 1-2 ticket for the week. Whew. That took at least 5 minutes, including
a puzzling episode where the ticket machine wanted a 50-cent piece and
wouldn't accept the one I kept giving it. Alas, I had to put in a 1 Euro
piece, and get back: another 50-cent piece for my collection!
  
  
Shivering a little in my wet jeans, I was happy to see the train. I found
a car which took bikes and got on. I had to lock my bike up in front of
another one, so I had to keep an eye on the area in case that person needed
to get off. Suddenly I was accosted by a middle-aged man in traditional
Bavarian costume. "Hochheimer auf gehts i'habe?" he said, or something
like that. I made a non-committal noise and went to sit down. A little
while later he reappeared and I had to say I couldn't speak German. He
started speaking in what might once have been English, but he was clearly
really drunk. Then he held out his hat for some money. I gave him a Euro,
probably a mistake. He wandered around the train asking for money and swaying
gently.
  
  
After 10 minutes or so I saw that my stop was coming up so I went to unhook
my bike and get off. But alas! Kontrolle! Kontrolle! The black-clad men
with badges had found me again, and, seeing me move towards the bike, two
stood in the way. I explained that my german wasn't good, and started pulling
out cards. 1 for my bike, 1 for me, and another for me in the 2 inner zones.
They kept talking and I couldn't understand but it seemed like I'd done
something wrong because I was the life of their party. Finally one of them
took some pity and explained in English that the 2 cards I bought at the
station weren't valid because I hadn't stamped them. Darn! That is just
kind of hard for me to understand, I guess I always think that when I buy
the card it becomes "in use" from that moment. But...they let me go, looking
kind of aggrieved and disappointed...perhaps I was too easy a target?
  
  
The train had stopped though, and knowing how quickly the S-bahn pulls
away again, I had a frantic rush to unlock the bike, gather my various
tickets, my wallet, etc. and throw it all off the train. In fact, the door
had already closed and I had to press a little red button repeatedly to
get it open again. It took me about 10 minutes to re-assemble my possesions
once off the train. These are the kinds of things that happen to someone
in a strange land. The most normal, routine actions take a lot of work!
  
  
Now I had to get back to my neighborhood, near Friedenheimerstrasse (I
was at the Laim S-bahn station). It was raining **hard** now.
Oh well, I'm already wet! It was probably a 2.5 mile bike ride in the dark
cold rain. Neal and Pramilla were out. I went straight for a hot shower
and some tea.
  
  
We sold our house! John Sharp did such a great job, and I hope the new
owners are really happy with it.
  
  
Tomorrow's big thing is that I'll get a bank account, then Kris will try
to wire money to it to pay for our apartment. I'd also like to go out and
eat at a restaurant, I've been really frugal about food, and have been
kind of beaten up lately. A beer and sausage or steak would be great.
  
  
I'm really glad Kris and I can talk via GoogleTalk or Skype. I can't wait
to hug "The Boyos." It's been a week and half but it feels like forever.
