Peter and I had a few hours before work, so we met at a park-n-ride
around 4 am. Bleary-eyed, and wondering what the hell we were doing,
we drove to Snoqualmie Pass and stumbled out. A long somnolent stumble
up Commonwealth Basin took us to Red Pass. The area was dusted with
nice, sleepy new snow. I followed Peter up to a false summit of
Lundin, and looked across at the still-snoring true summit. Peter set
up a rappel down an exposed gully, and wrapped me in swaddling clothes
for my descent. At the bottom, I unhooked from the rope and took my
blanket over to a narrow ridge to wait. He fell asleep while coiling
the rope, so I carried him a ways along the ridge, snoring like a
baby! This tuckered me out, so I crawled into his backpack for a
nap. He was looking for me at the belay for the short, easy pitch
below the summit!  Little did he know I was safely coddled right
there! With a start, I awoke and silently belayed him on the rock
step. On the summit, Peter set up a hauling system and I unclipped the
big bolts as I was lifted even with them.

After a short nap, I was feeling tired, and wanted a nap. It was like a dream up there. I think
we bounded down the south face, bouncing on the pillowy, velvet rocks. I heard giggling all
the way to the car, where we got some real rest on the way back. G'night!
