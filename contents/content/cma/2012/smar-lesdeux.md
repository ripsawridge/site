### Downhill skiing, Les Deux Alpes
<i>March 31, 2012</i>

Great trip with folks from work as a "Team Event." It was great to be back in
the Haute Alpes! We skied everything under the Jandri Express lift, did a turn
up on the easy run on the glacier, did many runs down from Lac Noir. On the way
out (I had to leave early, shortly after lunch), I skied the black Bellecombes
run which was excellent if a bit icy. Then, against everyone's advice, I skied
down to the valley actually finding an excellent black run called Valentin that
took me all the way down. Nobody belives me, they all think the valley run is
icy and full of rocks. The funny thing was that it was by far the best skiing,
go figure.
