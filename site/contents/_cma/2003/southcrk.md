<h2>South Crack, Grade II, 5.8 R</h2>

Well, it was our last day for climbing, sigh. We'd had such a great time.
South Crack is a classic, awesome route with some great 5.8 finger cracks.
Here are notes from our journal:

Fun flake grabbing led to a delicate traverse to a wide crack, made easier
by a flake in the back. The crack narrowed to finger-width, occasionally
pinching off to nothing (5.8). Sustained, great climbing here!
Semi-hanging belay from a cam, nut and piton.

Beautiful finger pinches! As I climbed <i>I let the world know how awesome
they were!</i> Stopped halfway up at nice ledge because a slow party in
front blocked the way. Michael and I took a long nap on seperate ledges
while we waited, then I belayed him to my ledge. (5.8)

Led the rest of the crack to the start of slab! Looked like runout climbing
above...It was!

<td>Michael</td>
<td>50 m</td>
<td>
Got two pieces of gear in the right trending crack, then set off left for
unprotected 5.6 friction. A good cam placement was the only protection for
25 feet of 5.7 slab climbing to a gear belay atop flakes. Exciting pitch!

<td>Led easy runout slabs to bolts. One piece on entire pitch. (5.4)
</td>

Straight up on easy slab then crack climbing to ledge belay that marked
end of climb (5.5). Traverse left to descent route.

Again we hiked down 3rd/4th class slabs like our previous trip to
Stately Pleasure. This is another great climb with a great partner!
