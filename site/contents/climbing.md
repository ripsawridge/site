## What do I like to do?

I seek adventurous, moderately technical alpine climbs in my own
neighborhood. With a busy family and work life, I am not able to make time for
expedition mountaineering. I also hate sitting in a tent for days, so I value
flexibility in planning, preferably having an alternate goal in a drier region
or maybe changing from climbing to hiking if the weather is rainy.

I don't really do "pleasure trips." For me, the relaxation comes as a warm glow
at the close of a big adventure. Time is limited, and we must do as much as we
can with it! At the same time, I believe laughter and friendship are an
essential part of the mountain experience and I value them highly.

I know the mountains are a place of risk and danger. I seek to minimize the risk
by travelling light, moving fast, and keeping in practice for moving smoothly
over alpine (dangerous) terrain. At the same time, I love to climb traditionally
protected routes, where routefinding ability and protection placement skills can
be exercised.

I've written articles about alpine climbing on Summitpost [here](http://www.summitpost.org/article/298107/Thoughts-on-4th-class-terrain.html)
and [here](http://www.summitpost.org/article/284184/Alpine-Climbing-Thoughts.html). I've also
had the great honor to spend a few days climbing with my friends Aidan Haley and Fred Beckey
on his first climbing trip to Europe. We spent 5 days in the Dolomites, and Aidan made a movie
about the trip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9d9Of1NJjs).

## What are my skills?

* I comfortably lead alpine rock to 5.10b YDS (about VI+ UIAA).
* I will follow "anything," though I prefer routes where I can lead half the pitches.
* On ice, I lead to WI4.
* Familiar and practiced with glacier travel and crevasse rescue techniques.
* I am comfortable on loose, exposed alpine terrain, and can solo mid-5th class when required.
* I have climbed up and down 2600 meters in a day (though it was tough!). A typical mountain day for me will involve 1500-2000 meters of climbing, depending on the activity.
* I enjoy long ~12-16 hour days in the mountains, and like an early start.
* Moderate ski touring ability. Ascent/descent of 2000 meters as a day trip.
* Good map/compass/altimeter navigation skills.
