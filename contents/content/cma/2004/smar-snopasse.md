### Snoqualmie Pass Skiing, March 6, 2004

I had from 8 until noon, so I decided to visit the Snoqualmie Pass ski area.
I started at Summit West, and gradually worked my way over to Summit East,
skiing some runs multiple times for fun. The most crowded lift was at
Summit East, so pretty soon I started back. Fun time, and I thought Kris
would like these slopes better than Crystal Mtn since there are more
uniform beginner slopes. Pretty nice weather, including some sun. The
views of Guye Peak, Commonwealth Basin and the Gold Creek valley were very
pretty.
