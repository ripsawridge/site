## Monte Colàc - "Via Ferrata Dei Finanzieri"

A bit south of Canazei, we picked out a [via ferrata](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/via-ferrata-dei-finanzieri/) that would be fun to do.
We took a lift up to the Rifugio Tobia dei Giagher, and walked up the short valley to the Sella Brunech (2428 m). We then traversed a
beautiful grassy ridge to the normal way up the peak. It's funny that we went *down* the via ferrata.

I remember huffing and puffing our way to the summit, then having fun on the via ferrata on the way down. The view of the Marmolada were
really amazing.

## Lago di Fedaia to Passo Pordoi

On another occasion we parked at the beautiful Lago di Fedaia, then set
out to hike to the Passo Pordoi and spend the night. Here I played the
tour guide, and from the pass looking down to the Passo Pordoi, I turned
back and jogged to the car. Carlos and Theron endured a huge rainstorm,
and I drove over to meet them, later hearing about the many exciting things
that happened. This was great fun.

## Val Zebru and Val Cedec over two days

Because of bad weather in the Dolomites, I urged us to head west and do a multiday hike.
Now I can apologize -- in those days I lived with a stressed-out sense that a day wasted
was like the loss of a million dollars! My friends would have been happy to hang out
in a Dolomiti village, hike a little bit, and just hang out. I am sorry I denied them this!
We piled into my car and took off. We must have started the hike in Sant Antonio, moving
up into Val Zebru. We stopped once or twice at little stands for cappucino and cake.
It must have been a pretty long day, because Val Zebru is pretty long!

The views in the upper reaches of the valley were expansive and amazing, dominated by the
Königspitze. We took many pictures. We found lots of barbed wire and "war ruins."
We did a lot of bouldering too.
Hiking down from Passo Zebru (3000 m), we passed the
Rifugio Pizzini Frattola, then spent the night nestled in the main valley bottom at
the Rifugio Ghiacciao der Forni.

The next morning we hiked up a peak to the south. I don't remember the name, but there were
enormous views and many waterfalls. It was a good trip within a trip! Though there was a lot
of driving to get over there and back into the Dolomites for our next climb.
But it was a good one!

We really did a big hike! Something like 1700 meters up and down, and over
20 kilometers.
