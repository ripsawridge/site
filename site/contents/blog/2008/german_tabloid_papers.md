The tabloids are a big part of life in Germany. They colorfully decorate
sidewalk corners with big screaming headlines. "PRICE SHOCK! ICE CREAM
NOW 2 EUROS!" (yes that was real). They are kind of fun to read though.
Lots of bold text, and _schadenfreude_.
  
  
Another "curious" aspect of these papers is that they always have a nude
girl at the bottom of the front page. Usually one or two more inside (okay,
yes, I looked!). Apologies to sensitive viewers for the nudity, but I had
to share one of these for the SHOCK! value:

The text that goes along with the picture is creepier than the picture
itself. For this one:
  
  

>   
> Valerie's dream became true!
>   
>   
> For a long time temp worker Valerie (20) from Freiburg wanted to pose
> for erotic photos. Now her dream has become true - in a fairy tale scene
> at a historical park, between colorful flowers and trees. Valerie (who
> is 1.70 meters tall) said: "My boyfriend Torston thought the photos were
> cool!" Today, Valerie has to go back to work in order to pay the 400 euro
> a month rent for her 40 square meter apartment.
>   
>   
> Valerie (Hobby: swimming) lives alone in her 40 square meter apartment.
>

Why so much about her apartment? Weird...
