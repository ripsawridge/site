<h3>Index Climbing, June 27, 2003</h3>

Josh W. and I went out before work. It was his first time to visit the fabled Index crag.
We started the day off "right" with a climb of Godzilla (5.9). It was my first time to
climb this classic pitch I had heard so much about over the years. I protected the first
moves with a few small nuts, then reached a large pointy flake that marks the beginning
of the ascent up a very steep long crack. Two cams below provided some confidence as I launched
into the rather long lieback. A brief rest on the ledge above, and I climbed again with
a 2 inch crack for my left hand, and a wide fist/hand crack for the right. I was approaching
a roof and wondering how to get around it. A great cam placement under the roof, and I
ventured above it on the right, thankful for awesome handholds on a ledge. From the ledge,
I stepped left to an amazingly exposed ledge near the anchors. I was surprised to be here
so quickly, having previously attained this point only via the "City Park" aid climb. A
nut and a cam protected the solid moves up and left in a fingercrack. I reached the anchor
and yodeled briefly. What a great steep pitch, but with good rests and protection! It's going
on my regular play circuit, that's for sure! Josh came up, enjoying the climbing, but noting
that he hadn't climbed much since a trip to Vantage in February. He did great through the
burly lieback, then had trouble in the cracks below the roof. The judicious use of a cam
as a moveable handhold allowed him to get past the difficulty. He arrived at the belay, and
we admired the morning display of peaks. A double rope rappel got us down (a single 60 meter with
stretch would probably juuuust make it).


Then we went to the Slab and climbed the second pitch of The Lizard (aka Aries) (5.8). This is a
great short finger crack. We continued up the Pisces hand crack (5.6) to a bolted belay. Josh
led the last pitch of Great Northern Slab, then we made 3 rappels to the ground.
Josh's quote: "Index is hard!"
