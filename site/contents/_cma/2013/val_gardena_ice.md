Georg and I got to spend the weekend climbing ice in Val Gardena. I'd
always wondered about ice climbing in the Dolomites, and apparently they've
had a good season. Somehow I'm too tired to write it all up, but we had
a great time. The icefalls right in the town of St. Christina were especially
inviting. [![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8251/8516066879_dd1507ae41.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/8516066879/)
