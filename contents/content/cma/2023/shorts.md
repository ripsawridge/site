### Wildbarren
_December 26, 2023_

I was sick and lazy for more than a week - must do a hike!
I visited my old friend Wildbarren. No one on my trail, just a lot of
new downed trees. I did a little bit of trail maintenence. Met some
people on top. A good time. This hike pushes me over 100k meters up and
down for the year.

### Großer Beil
_December 8, 2023_

This was kind of a lame ski tour, but I was happy for all the elevation.
I parked at the Alpengasthof Schönanger Alm, and skied up the road for a
good ways until it became trail. I followed this into forest with some
long traverses in the trees. At one point I had to take off skis to
navigate a little hand-rail section on rocks that I remembered from a
[summertime trip here with Barbara](../2020/beil.html). Finally I reached
a famous rock called the Glockhausstein -- we bouldered on that before.

I hadn't seen any descended ski tracks -- how did these people get down?
I continued up to a house, then beyond. The day was overcast and gray,
but at least I wasn't in a cloud. The local summits were clear.
The last meters to the summit were tough because the ski-track was
lost under snow-drifts. I had kind of hoped I could descend the north
face of the peak but one look down made it clear that was *way beyond*
my skills!

So I reversed my route down to the last house. I didn't get to enjoy the
skiing very much though, despite good snow because I simply couldn't
see anything correctly. I never knew how steep of a slope I was on. The
only visual aids were my tracks going up and even those were faint grey-on-grey
hints. Eventually I figured out that there was a road I could take down to
avoid the steep forest, which would be awful on skis. I descended
to find tracks from two descending skiers in the days before. They had to
cross a stream -- I found a better place to cross on a snow bridge. Then
some tiring uphill to get on the roadbed. Here I chose to unbind the
heel part of my boots and switch them into uphill mode for the long often
level road traverses. That was helpful. Eventually there was pretty nice
coasting down the road looking up at the peak. Unless there is a ski route
I don't know about, I don't recommend this mountain as a ski tour! 1200
meters up and down.

### Feldalphorn ski tour
_December 7, 2023_

Beautiful powder snow. Nice older folks, perhaps retired, out on this
Thursday. This will always be a favorite ski tour!

### Wallberg ski tour
_December 3, 2023_

Just a fantastic ski tour on this good clear day. I even bought a lift
ticket and went down one more time.

### Brauneck ski tour
_December 1, 2023_

First ski tour of the year! Heck, first ski tour in two years?! Terrible.
Anyway, it was raining at the trailhead but after an hour climbing it turned
to snow. It's been quite a while since I've done this tour so my memory of
it was dim. But I just followed the tracks. I had to learn to ski again on
the way down and gosh...it was fun! I left in increasing snow.

### Großer Riesenkopf
_November 4, 2023_

A nice hike up and down in the cold. Someone removed the steel cable from
the steep way on the side of a rocky peak.

### Kranzhorn
_November 1, 2023_

Quick hike up and down.

### Col Rodela (almost)
_October 28, 2023_

Paul and I stayed in Canazei, and did a little hiking. I also went alone
and hiked up to near the summit of Col Rodela from town, actually to the
Rifugio des Alpes restaurant a bit below the summit. It was getting dark
and I needed to get back down. About 1000 meters up and down. Beautiful
ridge hiking on the way up.

### Große Ochsenwand (August 10)
_October 6, 2023_

A great climb of the *klettersteig*. I met an American woman there from
Colorado, she was practically running up this thing!

grass.*

*A closed-for-the-season alm restaurant was friendly, offering cold drinks for sale...*

### Naunspitze
_June 11, 2023_

Hiked up with some water and a helmet to climb the grade II+ Southwest Ridge,
a nice little alternative to the normal way on the Naunspitze. To make up
for hiking with such a light pack, I resolved to leave the poles at home.
My goodness, this makes my legs work so much harder, but I know it's good
for me. I really have to balance time hiking with poles with time hiking
without poles. My legs are much stronger this way. Though, if I did it all
the time I suppose my knees would hurt.

At the hut below the summit, I finished the fantastic book by Andrew Klaven, "[The Truth and Beauty](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Beauty-Englands-Greatest-Understanding-ebook/dp/B09MH85H3S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1686563086&sr=8-1)."

### Großer Riesenkopf
_June 4, 2023_

I hiked up with a 9 kg pack, stopping at the Hohe Asten Alm on the way down
for a snack and a Weinschorle, and a cigar. Afterwards, I practiced solo
top-roping with a Gri-gri at Flintsbach, climbing a few easy things.
I do need some equipment upgrades to do this more safely.

### Bad Heilbrunn
_June 3, 2023_

Barbara and I went back and climbed:

* Ameisenkante (3)
* Salger-Ged.-Platte (4+)
* Schwarzer Riss (4+)
* Kondensstreifen (6+)

On Kondensstreifen, I wanted to lead it successfully, but it felt so dicey!
I made an attempt and chickened out, moving right into the Schwarzer Riss then
back left higher to give myself a top rope. I re-did the moves with that, then
finished to the anchor. I lowered off, tried again.

Again, a failure! This time I grabbed the 3rd quickdraw, feeling like I'd
slip if I tried to clip it.

I focused more on exactly what moves to make. There is one key slippery foothold
which will only last for so long before the foot slips. On the next try, I
found that if I hooked my left thumb on a crease by my chest, I gained security
on that slippery left foot while moving the right foot to the next minor indentation.

So finally I found the way, and led the route successfully from the ground up,
though quickdraws were in place for clips 1, 2 and 3. It's really amazing how
big the mental barrier is for slabs in my mind. But this experience helped a lot.
Thanks to Barbara for patient belaying and lowering!

### Bad Heilbrunn
_May 27, 2023_

Barbara and I climbed here, great fun!

* Ameisenkante (3)
* Kleine PLattenverschneidung (3+)
* Siebenschläfer (5+)
* Glühwürmchen (5-)
* Salger-Ged.-Platte (4+)
* Schwarzer Riss (4+)
* Kondensstreifen (6+)

That last I did on top rope - really fun! Excited to go back and lead it.

### Martinswand with Werner and Helmut
_May 18, 2023_

Werner, Helmut and I climbed [Emmentaler](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/emmentaler-martinswand/) and then [Bronchitis](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettern/bronchitis-martinswand/). A very nice
use of Father's Day. As it turns out, we are all dads. :)

### Point 2265
_May 7, 2023_

I hiked from the town of Walten to the summit of Point 2265 (my name for it,
though there is a summit cross). I followed roads up to the west, then trail
from the Fleckner Hütte. A bit of scrambling at the end to reach the top.
The peak Fleckner looked difficult without boots and maybe an ice ax.

Views to mountains in the northwest were spectacular. I'd like to explore that
area more...1120 meters up/down.

### Mutspitze
_May 6, 2023_

A great walk from my hotel in Dorf Tirol to the summit of the Mutspitze.
Two weeks before, I attempted it, but deep snow turned me around.

From the summit, I thought about traversing the ridgetop to the Taufenscharte
and descending it to the Leiter Alm, but the snow looked unappealing. I'm
so allergic to snow these days! So I retraced my steps. What a beautiful summit.

1941 meters up/down.

### Glaitner Joch (attempt)
_May 5, 2023_

I hiked from a little museum building a bit above the town of Sankt Leonhard
towards the pass. A nice man let me park, essentially, in his yard where
he was doing carpentry. He was there when I got back too, and also let me
have water from his spring. Really nice, because I was dying of thirst.

Snow stopped me about 150 meters below the pass. It was knee deep soft
stuff. Reminded me of the San Juans last year. Quite interesting, the near-vertical
town of Glaiten, whose yards I huffed and puffed through between clearings in
the forest. The high meadows were gorgeous. I love the brown grass of
this Texel-adjacent region. 1534 meters up/down.

### Mutspitze (attempt)
_April 22, 2023_

I found myself in Meran, and attempted to hike from town to the Mutspitze.
However, snow on the upper ridge got me to turn around. A great dinner of
Knödel in Dorf Tirol afterwards! Then a walk down through the vineyards
as the sun went down.

Still, 2000 meters up/down.

### Gantkofel
_early April, 2023_

Before meeting Jong for a climbing trip, I had a partial day. So I
hiked and scrambled up the Gantkofel through a narrow, icy gully to the Kematscharte.
Then down a different
*scharte* (pass/gully) which was still very steep! 1300 meters up/down.

### Heimgarten
_January, 2023_

A fun hike after staying overnight with Alexander in Weilheim for his birthday
celebration. Lots of fresh snow, and snowing on and off. Up the normal route,
where folks at the Murnau DAV Huette invited me in to eat lunch! Down via
the long ridge, sometimes breaking trail in deep snow.

### Stanser Joch
_January 7, 2023_

I'd never done the hike straight up from the town of Stans. It was fantastic!
I thought it would be 1500 meters up through *latschen* but it was pleasant,
if very steep, forest and occasional meadow. Only in the last 300 meters were
there periods of time spent in the *latschen*, and of course the final 150 meters
were wide open. I enjoyed a chat with a woman who lived in Schwaz, hiking up
here from home, preferring not to drive anywhere.

### Scheffauer
_January 6, 2023_

A great hike up Scheffauer from the south. I carried snowshoes up to the point
it was clear I didn't need them. I was glad for hiking boots on tricky, icy
steep parts in the last 200 meters to the summit. Beautiful day. Pictures to
come...

### Plessenberg
_January 1, 2023_

A great hike up Plessenberg from the Ascherjöchl, then down the west side
to the Jocheralm and to the ground. I listened to the great album
[Static Deviations](https://www.sigmadewe.com/home.html?&L=1) by Jameson Nathan Jones.
