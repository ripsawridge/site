### Krottenkopf
_July, 2009_

Got up at the crack of o dark thirty and hiked up the <a
href="https://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150888/krottenkopf.html">Krottenkopf</a>
from Oberau. 4500 feet elevation gain in 4.5 miles, reached the summit after 2
hours and 15 minutes. Then I had breakfast at the Weilheimer Huette: musli
cereal with peaches, apples, and tea. Very good! Excellent view of the
surrounding mountains from the summit, probably the best view peak of the
Estergebirge area. Traverses on the mountainside were tedious with many ups and
downs. Back at the car at just under 5 hours, including a 1 hour break for
breakfast. Fun!
