### Gilfert ski
<i>December 31, 2012</i>

Josef and I drove to Weer and then Innerst in the Tuxer Alps for a bit of
exercise. We skinned along a path exactly the wrong way for the first half
hour, then realized our mistake and came back to the car. Reset! Trying again,
we followed tracks up a road then across a meadow into fairly thick and steep
forest. After about 300 meters we could see the summit and it's cross. "We
still have 900 meters to climb!" said Josef. I thought he was joking, but sadly
he wasn't. For a couple of old out of shape guys that 900 meters drug on
forever. At least the sun was out with a crisp and clear view north into the
Karwendel Mountains behind us. On top we admired other Tuxer and Zillertal
summits. We headed down, finding protected powder stashes though it was mostly
skied out. We lingered and stopped often to discuss the state of the world. It
was great to get out with Josef, we haven't been on a trip together in like a
year!
