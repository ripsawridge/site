Barbara and the small dog headed up again on the north side, then taking
the steep logging turn-off to get on the North Ridge. Gorgeous. Little
bit of fresh falling snow below the summit. Then sun. Down to the southwest,
then my cut-off through dense wood to drop to the knoll above the lake.
After the lake, up and over up and down to the Hohe Asten lodge, now
closed due to plague. From there, as directly down to the valley
as possible, following ridge spurs, bits of logging track, basically
whatever we could find. 1550 meters up and down.
