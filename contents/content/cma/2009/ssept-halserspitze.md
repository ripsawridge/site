### Halserspitz
_September 22, 2009_

An early morning hike before work. I made a big loop going south and east to
scramble up the North Ridge of the Halserspitz (exposed bits of trail) then
followed the long ridge west and down to a hut for some beer. Then down the
Wolfschlucht back to the car. I banged my knee really good up on the long ridge
and hollered and yelped for a few minutes from the pain. I thought I was
totally alone! 10 minutes later on another summit I saw a guy and had to
apologize for making a big racket!
