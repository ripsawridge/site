### Schafreuter
_February 10, 2008_

I was sick the week before and didn't get to exercise at all. Plus the weather
was great this weekend. So I tiptoed out of the house early to snowshoe up
Schafreuter. This peak in the northern, fairly tame part of the Karwendel
mountains offered a great view to the famous Laliderwand. The peak also marks
the border between Germany and Austria. Halfway up I reached a snowy meadow and
needed to put on snowshoes. The views got better and better. Near the summit a
solitary skier drank from a Thermos. We exchanged greetings, and I continued to
the true summit. Very nice to be there! On the way down the skier had already
left, but he warned me that this was a "modeberg" (fashionable mountain), so I
expected to see a horde of people on my way down. I did lots of running and
jumping down the slopes, and started running into people back at the meadow. On
the long icy road jog down there were many people coming up. Amazingly, I went
fast enough that I reached the car right behind the skier. He looked a little
surprised!

Time: 3:30 round trip, 1285 meters up and down.
