* June 10-11, 2000

 "Ow!" In a flash of unpleasant clarity, I'd had an idea. Let's climb
Prusik Peak before overnight permits are required. Sure we'll have snow
everywhere, but that didn't stop Beckey who climbed it in May for
cripes sake! We all rearranged our plans a little bit, then spent the
week festering about what to take and what to leave. A stove was reluctantly
brought because we might not have running water at Lake Viviane, our
intended camp spot. Crampons were left behind. Two rope teams of two,
each with 60 meter ropes. The participants were:


* Steve - claims to have a hip injury. Smokes us all on the approach.
* Jake - Expert mountain climber. He forgot his helmet and his sleeping pad.
* Peter - Can recite most of "the Holy Grail." Willing to jump into snowy lakes.
* Michael - Devious in the extreme. Not above stealing food. Will put rocks in your pack.


Musical director John Bennett was scheduled to appear at our camp, sing a few
quatrains, and head down in the morning while we climbed.


We were hiking before 8 am, but it already felt hot n' dusty on the first
switchbacks. At two miles, we paused to admire the Snow Creek Wall, 
strangely empty of climbers.

We met a weary but proud group of three on the trail before Nada Lake.
They had climbed Prusik Peak, coming up from Aasgard Pass. They had set
off a slab avalanche near the top of the pass, scaring them enough to
walk out the Snow Lake trail and hitch back to their car. They put to
rest any illusions we had of climbing the peak today. It took them 12
hours from base to base! 2 hours just for nasty steep snow without an ice
ax, or boots. We bid them farewell, and they chuckled about the cardboard
strapped to Jake. He had fashioned apple boxes into a poor sleeping pad.


Victory at Nada Lake, 
we were finally getting somewhere! We irritated
Peter by refusing to walk back and pose by the lake. He "gets a lot of
crap" for taking landscape pictures, and apparently he's "tired of taking
that crap" so he tried to finagle a body into every photo. He pantomimed
a few incidents where "crap" was dispensed and unwillingly taken.


At Snow Lake we had a long rest, and Peter almost jumped into the water.  He
contemplated a bouldering problem far out in the lake, and we urged him on as
true friends should. But then we fell asleep and lost interest. I ate a sardine,
and couldn't believe I didn't throw up.  I actually liked it.


Reluctantly, we put our boots back on and climbed to Lake Viviane,
nearly giving up halfway. The trail was steep and difficult to keep track
of among the snowbanks, brush and slabs. Some of us felt kind of
queasy. Luckily, Jake got his second wind, and forged ahead with
new energy, finding the way to camp, then planning a climb of Little Annapurna
("A Woman's Place") across the Enchantments. We all refused to accompany
him, but he did get me to scout the approach with him. We kicked steps
in the snow that we could use in the frozen morning. We climbed up,
then over to the west, looking for better views. The mountain was spectacular!
The appearance from the west is divine, while from the southeast it's just
a jumble of blocks. How long I've seen this view in photographs, I couldn't
believe we were actually here. And this whole enchanted valley belonged to
us. The only tracks we saw were from the party of three, and these were
melting in the sun.


Back at camp, we said hello to the "Kamp Goat" who circled around with a
curious smile. He was losing his winter coat, and had a distinctive bald patch
on his neck. We jealously guarded our boots, knowing he would want them!


Peter shared summer sausage and a neat wax container of cheese with me.
Jake and Steve tried to sleep, but Peter and I (both 29) carried on a conversation
typical of our generation:


 "Did you have a snowspeeder?"

 "Yes"

 "Did you have the Degobah playset?"

 "Of course!"

 "I never had Luke in Hoth attire, did you?"

 "Oh yeah, also Han Solo. Yoda was a quality figure, you got a
cane, a cloak, a snake and a tool belt."

 "Yes, and IG-88 had an awesome gun. I nearly wet myself when I
got the Millennium Falcon."

 "I know I did!"


This went on until the goat came and stared us down. When he
left we started up again, on another favorite topic. Steve and
Jake endured us stoically.


 "We are the Knights who say...KNIE!"

 "We shall use my larger scales!"

 "It's not a question of how 'e grips it, it's a simple matter of
weight ratios!"

 "Did you get my note?"

 "Er, I got A note..."


I laughed way too hard and loud at the old Monty Python lines, 
prompting another visit by the
goat who flashed his curious smile and dead, coal black eyes.


The first half of "sleep" was marked by sweat, claustrophobia,
and "soft spots" on my skull that complained about the rock I used
as a pillow. Finally, I took off the sweater, hat and extra shirt I
thought I needed, and lost consciousness.


We reluctantly awoke to the tiny 4:30 wrist alarms. Jake had
survived the night on cardboard, mistaking his arm for a meaty 
sea-creature when the whole thing fell asleep. I played "Contact/Crumb
Jamboree" in my sleeping bag in an unfortunate Pop-Tart/eye-wear debacle.
Peter felt better, probably regretting giving up so much of that
summer sausage. We stomped up a hill, down and steeply up towards the
mountain. Our pre-fabricated boot steps were nice to have, as the
snow had hardened considerably. I thought about the route and all
the slightly conflicting beta we had acquired. Steve was going strong,
never even mentioning his injured hip. He had totally turned the
situation around. By getting out and climbing, the injury seemed to
have disappeared!


We roped up at the balanced rock, setting a belay at a wizened tree
20 feet above. I moved up, suddenly confused by the jumble of black
and tan rock. First there was a crack with the lichen scraped off by
hundreds of padding feet. After that, it was as if every climber had
taken a different route. "Okay, fine!" I thought, doing the same.
Around a boulder, up on top, to the left, no more rope. I have the
uncanny ability to run out of any amount of rope you give me, and now
I'd done it with a 60 meter rope. Struggling 7 more feet, and I had
a big picnic table rock to squat 'n scratch on. I reeled in a 
business-like Steve, and surrendered the rack. He padded around a bulge,
clipping an old fixed sling. Within seconds he was at the 5.7
friction pitch, so often mentioned for it's (oooh!) "12 foot runout".
After two moves, he was on the crest placing a cam.


Peter was fiddling with protection at a crux move below. He made the
move and joined me, happy with his first wilderness lead. Just to
annoy our companions, we switched ropes, and Peter followed Steve
up, giving me a chance to belay again. He left me his rack, festooned
with hexes and tied slings. Jake bellied up to the bar, and I took
off. A bouldery hop across a 12 foot chasm was an unexpected move before
the friction pitch. I clipped the iron piton at the base, didn't find
anything for my gear, and started up. A good but thin hold for the left
hand, tiny nubbins for the feet, and the slab's edge for the right hand
encouraged me. Two more steps and I crouched at the top. Fumbling
with the unfamiliar rack, I placed a forged friend, and steadfastly
refused to look down and right. But the hungry maw looked at me!
Whistling as I worked, I climbed to a bulging tower, and traversed
around the south on an easy ledge. On the other side, I straddled the
ridge crest, "riding" my way to flat ground. There was a lot of rope
drag here, but the climbing was easy. I just yanked about 5 feet of
rope at a time, paying it out as I moved forward.


Peter had attempted to girdle the peak on a long traverse, perhaps
imagining a first corkscrew ascent. He was reeled back and sent upward,
to find the elusive "highest easy ledge" Beckey mentions. Meanwhile,
Jake was out-of-sight, dealing with inner demons on the friction slab.
He was able to get a very high "body friction" coefficient, and
successfully emerged around the corner, only to be mobbed by the
paparazzi intent on photos by the hundreds. He suitably "worked it"
for the camera and skootched across the shark fin ridge.


I climbed up to Peter's ledge, admiring his hand-crafted gear anchor.
He used the yellow Alien, thus preserving it's record of getting
used on every climb. I wouldn't go anywhere without my little yellow
Alien! Soon the four of us milled around on the ledge, Jake and
I inadvertently playing "see-saw" on a tottering block. It was Steve's
lead on what looked to be the hardest and best part of the climb.
We watched in rapt attention as he jammed up to a ledge, traversed
to a dihedral and sunk some gear. His "mantel" onto another ledge was
something to see. His most private aspects were slowly crushed by
a knot of carabiners and the unforgiving granite. Sadly, the
camera was put away. Mental note: don't let that happen to me!
(note from Steve: "I want to set the record straight:  
My mantel was a paragon of grace!")


Stoically, he forged on, just out of sight, finally coming to the
 "5.4" chimney. Someone may be able to prove we were off route, but
this was the only obvious chimney around. Steve got a good cam in
at the base, then was confounded by the maneuvers required to get
higher. We listened to his ice ax bang listlessly on the granite
wall above as he cycled through different postures. He called on
 "The Inner Ron Kauk" and forced our hand. Now there was no retreating,
our leader had gained the pinnacl'd point of Prusik! In a flurry of
activity, Peter climbed, avoiding the traverse by starting at the
dihedral's base. I followed, getting a belay from Jake below. As
Peter pantomimed patiently past protection points, he purposefully
left what Steve had placed there, only the hour before. 
Churlishly, I purloined the pre-placed pieces for my pink-point
ascent. Peter hollered some advice to me about a pendulum and a
flake. Steve hollered some advice to me about a chimney and
a left foot. I just kept climbing. Peter got some pictures of me
on a fun flake, and I got a picture of him in the chimney. With
advice from our chimney expert above, Peter nicely climbed up.
I moved into it, clipped to a good cam and started up. A strenuous
move with a poor right foot, and a tenuous hand jam allowed me
to paw at loose rocks near the chimney exit. I made use of Steve's advice, 
wedging my shoulders
into the chimney. It was very secure, in fact, I could have dangled
my feet uselessly, and still felt great.


In summary, this final obstacle will really get your blood flowing,
especially with a pack filled with boots, ice ax, etc. Don't laugh at
me when I say it felt like 5.8. Ok, fine...laugh.


Now it was Jake's turn, and just when we were relaxing and unroping at
the summit, he was in flight below us! Steve and Peter looked at me
in disbelief when I said "Jake just pendulumed across the face!"
 "I didn't even feel it!" said Steve, or something like that.
A moment later, Jake said he was ok, but he did hit his knee pretty hard.
He had tried a 5.13 variation before the final ledge, and found himself
instantly airborne. Amazingly, he climbed back up, let me haul his pack,
then climbed the chimney so quickly we all felt ashamed of our groveling
performance. Ignoring our amazement and offers of sponsorship, Jake moved
to the summit, and we crowded around his knee. It was swollen, which
worried us all. It must have hurt a lot.


Okay, so now our mood was 
*"gosh-what-a-great-place-we-did-it-wow-but-we-should-hurry-down-before-that-knee-stiffens-up"*. We
took a lot of pictures, and I signed the summit register for all of
us. Peter said each party member had to put their signature instead,
otherwise it "didn't count". We read a note in there that this guy
from Wenatchee had solo climbed the route in 19 minutes. He also made
sure to write down how quickly he soloed Dragontail and one or two
other peaks.


Steve threw the ropes, and disappeared over the north side. Rappelling
on two 60 meter ropes, he made it a long way down to some slings. Jake
was next, then Peter and I.  "So long!" I said, sure I wouldn't
visit this place for few years at least.  I liked the summit, there
was room to camp up there, it was nice and sunny, and the incredible
exposure of the south face acts as an air conditioner: a cold sweat
always results from a look down there.


At the station, I changed into my boots, since we were going through
increasing amounts of snow. Later, to pass the time at the rappel
stations, Peter and I had a rousing game of paper, rock,
scissors. Then he made up some rabbit, carrot, gun game, but I beat
him at that too. Pulling the rope after the second rappel, a
moderately sized rock came down on us. It was about the size of a
paperback. We didn't know this though, and Steve's cries of "Rock!"
changing to "Big Rock! Big Rock!" caused me to try and burrow under
Peter. It was coming straight for Steve, but landed harmlessly in the
snow 3 inches from Peter and I. Now we all worried about Jake's head,
the only one unprotected by plastic.  When I looked at him, it seemed
to get bigger by the second, attracting rocks with a fierce
gravitational pull. One more half rappel, and we stood on a steep
snowy ledge. Wow! I was glad we brought our ice axes.  Peter stuffed
400 feet of rope into his pack to relieve Jake. He was doing great,
figuring out how to walk so the knee injury didn't slow him down too
much.


We carefully traversed the snow, coming out near the base of the
route. Some more scrambling, and we began the descent to camp. The
snow was too soft to glissade, so long plunge steps got us there
quickly. I rescued our gear from the tree, then fell into a stupor of
pleasure consuming my last half sandwich. I had carried a bulky
Tupperware case to protect them, so it was as fresh and unsquashed as
when Kris made it for me. Contrast this with the mystery "tomato or
bread?" questions Jake had to ask of his sandwich, and the debauched
helplessness of Peter's once-proud peanut butter sandwiches. Total
failure of bread/innards integrity.  I couldn't poke fun at Steve's
sandwiches because he went the whole day on two Fig Newtons, and I
think he coughed one of those up. Too dry.


We packed up, each carrying more to offer Jake some relief. We said
goodbye to the goat, and soon raced down the snow slopes towards Snow
Lake. I found a cache of cairns we had missed on the way up, but they
led nowhere. Cursing, I followed Steve back up, crossing a waterfall
and rotten snow. This part of the trail went very quickly. Jake got
another tick. We each fell down into rotten snow holes. Finally, we
got to the lake and made the endless traverse around it. At the dam,
we had a long rest, where I consumed everyone's remaining food. I ate
sardines, powerbars, goo, candy bars - basically anything nobody else
wanted. (note from Steve: *"At the dam, Michael went
into such a frenzy of eating, that I was concerned that he had started
to channel Euel Gibbons and would continue gorging on bark and pine
cones, and denude the entire forest!"*) I was
feeling ok, but trying not to think of the 6+ miles we had to go. It
must have been about 5:30 pm. The trip down to Nada Lake was pretty
nice. I enjoyed the view of Steve and Jake bouncing far ahead on the
trail, and Peter taking great interest in the flowers behind.


Actually, the switchbacks above the lake brought a rare moment of
peace for me. Looking down on the lake, nestled among trees and steep
canyon walls, I didn't want to move, just stare at it until the sun
went down. Peter seemed to share this feeling, and for a brief time,
we could smile without worrying about the many miles to go, on already
aching feet. Brian Burdo said in one of his guidebooks "When it comes
to happiness, 95\% of success is just slowing up."  At the lake,
Peter noticed a grand waterfall we had missed on the way up. I tried
to get water from the lake, but a stringy worm twitched in my
bottle. No rest for the wicked!


Down, down, down in growing darkness. I hadn't seen Steve or Jake in a
long time, so Peter and I were sticking together. He had at least one
big blister, and each step hurt a lot.  Finally, Steve was waiting for
us, explained that he needed to hurry and get back for an 8 am meeting
in Oregon. We raced ahead, leaving Peter and his blister to a private
trail of tears. I remembered my own "trail of tears". Four miles
along the white river in full-shank heavy boots. Steve had raced ahead
to escape the bugs. I wallowed in misery, wearing all my goretex in
the stifling heat, hundreds of mosquitoes frantically trying to
puncture the seal. I didn't even want to look at my feet. Finally, I
reached bottom, sitting down by the river in a puddle of deer
urine. Steve's car reeked for months. I now have a bone spur at the
site of that horrible heel blister.


We found Jake at the car just at full dark, around 10 pm. Feeling
pretty good, I prepared to climb back up and take Peter's pack. But
lo! A figure staggers up in the dark, only 15 minutes behind us! He
hadn't even sat in deer urine. I was impressed, I certainly would have
found some.


We went from "beer for all!" to "how about a meal at least?" to
"I'm just going home." as the day went on. Four sleepy, exhausted
bodies motored over the pass to the west, where all the people live.


Notes from John Bennett
-------

*This side-story is from fellow climber John Bennett, who tried to
meet up with us on the Snow Creek trail. Considering his generosity to
these climbers, and the time that took, it wasn't meant to be. But he
saved the day with an interesting tale and a restorative hike to the
Snow Creek Wall.*


It all started when I decided to get up really early and head out to
Leavenworth from Seattle. Unfortunately I didn't leave Seattle until
9:30. I was on my way to a trail-head up Icicle Creek when I noticed
three hitch hikers, one going down the canyon and two going up. They
looked pretty tired and I said to myself, "man I'm glad I'm not those
guys". Upon reaching the trail-head I saw a sign that said you needed
a trail head park pass and noticed that I the gazillion passes I have
wouldn't work and I would have to go to the store and buy yet another
pass. For a moment I sat in my car thinking gee, I really need to
develop a project plan with milestones, critical path, key activity
drivers, sponsor list, process flow, budget, and of course a RACI
(responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) chart to maintain all
the different passes I need to acquire in a year to go outside on a
weekend and not think about work. I never knew how complex it is to go
for a walk. Finally I decided the right thing to do is to buy another
pass.


On my way down the canyon I decided to pick up one of the hitch
hikers, he said he needed to get to a phone because is party was a day
late in checking in. During the ride he mentioned that he was coming
back from Prusik Peak and I told him I was going to hook up with some
of my buddies just below Prusik and camp out with them.  The
hitchhiker perked up and said his group had met up with another group
and it was probably my friends. I was really psyched he met up with my
friends until he said, "Man do those guys have a long day in front of
them"! Just then every lazy cell in my brain perked up and thought
"long day, no one said anything about a long day".


By noon I was on my way back up the canyon and was rolling into the
parking lot when I saw the other two hitchhikers and realized they
were in the same party with the guy I picked up earlier and I decided
to give them a ride as well. They needed to go back to Colchuck Lake
trail-head and my hiking brain cells were saying, "we really need to
start hiking" of course my lazy brain cells we saying "we're doing a
good deed and the trail can wait" (convincing little brain cells
aren't they). During the ride back to Colchuck trail head they were
discussing how light my friends were going and how the crux on the
last pitch is well understated in the Beckey guide. By the time I made
it back to the lower trail head it was closer to 1:00 and figured
there was no way I would catch up with Michael and the gang until very
late and decided to hike a few miles, have lunch and mosey on back to
Seattle. Not very exciting but I had a wonderful time helping out some
climbers and enjoying the beautiful weather.
