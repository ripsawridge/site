This was a really enjoyable weekend. I hiked up from Flirsch, gambling that
I wouldn't really have to deal with snow on the North Ridge of the Hoher
Riffler. There is a bit of grade III climbing on the ridge, and I was
afraid there might be some ice. No worries...it was in good shape for a jogger.

The pictures below aren't in order. I'll just list some impressions I remember
a month later.

Steep and quiet, wonderful walk through the forest above town to the
Ganatschalpe. They were still sleeping, except for a young man cleaning
the stables. He and I were both listening to headphones.

Descending from the Mittagspitze a bit, I started the rock climbing on 
the ridge. Really fantastic fun. Steeper on the ridge, and when it got to
be excessive, I could usually migrate to the right side and follow easier
grade II gullies. The crux was fairly distinct...a piton or bolt marked
the spot. Not difficult.

As I crossed the snowfield before the final ridge, the weather deteriorated
quite rapidly. Suddenly clouds were everywhere, and then it was a bit of a
race for the summit before the rock got too wet in spitting rain and hail.
Clouds were skimming through gaps in the ridge. From the point after the summit
register, there was a bit of stress. I remember moving as fast as I could
with heart pounding, but then remembering that distances are deceptive up
here, and I'd have to continue to pace myself.

On the summit I saw people across a little gap, and thought I'd reach them soon.
But the descent was tricky...I may have made a wrong turn. I ended up descending
a slabby face with climbing at least as hard as the crux of the North Ridge and
rather more sustained. Oh well!

Shortly above the hut on the way down, the sun was fully back out again and the day
was lovely. The hut was extremely crowded, and I had a rather awkward dinner with
some teenagers doing the walk to Meran. Hmm. Not easy to explain a book on
Kabbalistic symbolism, or why it's so fascinating. When I go do a trip on my own
these days, I enter a rather private world and want to think deeply. I'm probably
a bit of a cipher, but I can't be all things to all people, so it's okay.

The next day I was torn about how to get back to the car. It felt sad to just walk down
the normal way with such good weather. So I went the opposite direction, climbing an
unnamed summit near the Schmalzgrubenscharte, then descending to the meadows above
Kappl. I took a strange up and down path towards the north with semi-tragic wrong
turns. Finally I gave up in the town of See, as my feet hurt too much to continue
walking. I hired a taxi to get me to my car after a pizza.

The first day covered 11 kilometers with an elevation gain/loss of 2086 meters and
800 meters. The second day 24 kilometers with gain/loss of 1100 meters and 2400
meters.
