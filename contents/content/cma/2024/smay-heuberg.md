A wonderful day with Barbara and Sammy. On the way down I discovered how to
get Sammy to walk behind me, somewhat unwillingly. I keep at least one hand
or both behind my back, with the leash, and keep it just on the edge of feeling
where he is. He gets more slack if he stays back there. This is really helpful
on steep trails where he can easily pull me down the hill if I'm not careful.
We also tried letting him off the leash a couple times. The second time was
a disaster. We spent 10+ minutes criss-crossing steep slopes trying to get
him back. Uff!
