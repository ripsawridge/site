<h3>Mount Si, March 12, 2003</h3>

It was about 11 pm, we'd just finished a wonderful dinner at home (we tend
to eat late). I felt the need to hike, so I hopped in the car, arriving
at the trailhead 'round midnight. It took me one hour to reach the 3 mile
marker on the regular Mount Si trail. I had a great view of lights from
homes near North Bend, filtered by trees. Since I had to get up for work
soon, I figured that was enough, and retraced my steps home. Wierd, huh?
