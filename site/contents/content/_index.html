Here is my little place on the web where I write about things that interest me, primarily
mountains and spirit. The site was newly redesigned, apologies for some missing
features (like list of friends and blog categorization). Those features will return.
I'm making a new approach to site development -- it's all hand-rolled now (a Python script),
and there will be no cookies and no JavaScript.
