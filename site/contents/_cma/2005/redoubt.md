The Northeast Face of Redoubt had been on our list for a while, 
and I always thought of it as an August climb for some reason. 
However, as we read a few trip reports of the region, I started 
getting alarmed because sometimes the face is difficult to access 
by that time thanks to wide bergschrunds or a generally broken-up 
glacier. Plus, the low snow year could make it even harder. It 
seemed that the most successful parties went as early as June, in 
which case the steep ice wall on the face was straightforward snow. 
Then we kept having bad weather on the weekends. Once in June we slept 
at the Lake Ann trailhead in vain, filling our bivy sacks with rain 
before dejectedly going home at first light. Drew Brayshaw answered 
my query about conditions with a terse "should be good. The bad 
snow is more of a Washington thing." Hmm, thought I. By the 
time everything came together another two weeks had passed. Theron, 
Robert and I readied for the climb, grimacing as we threw full-shank 
mountain boots in the car, something we only take when steep snow 
and ice is expected. Those things tear up your feet on trails 
though, and we were right to anticipate some black-and-blue feet 
by the end of the adventure.

Sergio's trip report</a>
got us thinking that it would be a pretty easy approach. Looking back 
I'm not sure where that idea came from (wishful thinking?), so we weren't ready to walk 
from the trailhead until 3 pm Saturday. As the miles of brushy road-walking piled up, 
we started to hope to get to camp before dark. It's a pretty long drive from Seattle, 
and the road gets very rough before the end. Without a high-clearance vehicle we would 
have had another mile or so to walk. 


The border was marked by an obelisk in deep tangled forest, and the trail in the U.S. 
was first marked by numerous large and tedious blowdowns. After 1/2 mile or so it 
improved markedly and we passed the miles in conversation. Robert and I ribbed 
Theron about "Dubya" and the clear-cuts he might like to pursue in the area, while 
he regailed us with tales of former vice-president Al Gore's pomposity and "high-falutin'" 
manner. He did climb Mt. Rainier though and I think that oughta mean something in our 
little sect. 


After too long a time, we reached the base of an enormous waterfall. It was 
absolutely stunning. We hopped rocks to it's base and then scrambled up slippery 
rocks with the aid of a fixed line, getting soaked by waves of spray from the 
thundering volume. Our boots 
were especially treacherous on this terrain, having no ability to 
grip or give with the angle. Higher we climbed a steep scrambly trail on the left 
side of the falls, getting surreal glimpses of roaring water just on the other 
side of a tree branch. This section was muddy but entertaining after the long valley flats. 


I reached the top of the falls first, and stood agog at Mt. Redoubt 
shining above the trees. Robert came up and I solemnly informed him he was going 
to defecate himself with sheer joy - for the face looked in good nick! Theron 
arrived and I imitated the evil child Mordred, laughing in the forest as round 
table knights hung from the gibbet! He got a real kick out of that which was 
great after the tiring hike! 


Now we decided to hike all the way up to Ouzel Lake (not marked on the map, but 
the obvious lake at the valley head), because bashing directly across to the face 
might require numerous creek wadings. Due to the hard rain of recent days we'd 
already seen flooded sections of forest and thought the wade might be waist deep too. 
Ouzel Lake would be a great base camp if we had energy to climb Mt. Spickard on the 
third day (spoiler: we didn't!). 


But the hike up there felt really long, going over boulders and moraines, gaining 
1000 feet. Once at the lake, we were sheathed in damp mist and I cursed grumpily about 
crossing a stream Theron had waded through in his plastic boots. I had to go a good 
ways upstream to preserve some amount of integrity for my leather boots. Robert told 
us about a nirvana-like higher campsite and couldn't believe Theron wanted to lead 
us down to the lakeshore with it's bevy of mosqitoes (I couldn't tell the difference, 
but I hated any amount of extra walking by this point). I had brought the bug juice, 
but the bottle came unscrewed in my pocket, losing it all. So we ate in the damp 
cloud, swatting bugs and trying to stay psyched for the next day. Robert and I slept 
in the Betamid, and Theron provided the welcome news that the clouds had cleared by 
full dark. We slept pretty well until 4 am, then quickly arose and trudged off under 
a clear dawn. 


We followed the occasional cairn up a slabby, scrambly ridge to it's top, then left 
the marked route for a cross-country traverse to a rib at 6,000 feet. At the rib, we 
could see the upper part of our route in the sun, and pieced out a way leading across 
the glacier to it. We descended 100 feet from the rib, then climbed snow to the glacier's 
edge to rope up. Robert led us across the glacier for an hour, weaving our way across 
crevasses, making at least one exciting jump over a deep dark blue chasm. Near the end 
of our journey, I led us a steep headwall for a fun pitch of AI2 ice climbing in "hero" 
ice/neve. After another easier headwall I led us up to a belay spot in a crevasse at the 
bottom right side of the intimidating snow and ice face. 


Continuing for the first lead on the face I wondered if we'd find easy step kicking snow, 
rotten "horror" snow, or intimidating ice. The first pitch was definitely the former: a 
few kicks made a great step and axe shaft placements were solid too. I went ahead and 
built a belay station after 60 meters and brought Robert and Theron up. It was a really 
cool place to be, especially when I thought about how steep it looked from the trail 
in the valley below! 


Theron led the second pitch, entering a section of snow that had baked in the morning 
sun for an hour. He could make good steps for us, but the axe placements were quite poor. 
The angle seemed to steepen a bit too. We simul-climbed for 35 additional meters until 
he could find a good belay stance. Theron brought us up to a cool little ice cave with 
a bomber ice screw for protection. I led off again for an enjoyable 55 meter pitch with 
two sections of ice and three sections of steep snow. I gradually traversed leftward, 
making for rock towers where I hoped to place a nut or piton. Access to the rock was 
difficult, but I could build a nice belay station in a partially filled in crevasse 
next to the rock, again with bomber ice screw protection. It was fun peeking over the 
rim of my little house and looking down the steep couloir as my companions climbed. 


We thought there was one more pitch before the ice arete. The start was ugly, requiring 
too much flirtation with steep rotten snow on a rightward trending line. Theron led 
carefully out then sped up markedly after 40 meters. Robert and I simul-climbed behind, 
amazed by the steep wall of steps Theron had left and the huge rock walls on our right. 
At one point there was a rumble and a cascades of rocks shot out from gullies in mid-face. 
On the arete we stopped for a conference and some food. It was nice to no longer have 
gravity pulling at us from the ice face! 


We were interested in climbing a rock variation of the route above the arete but had 
little information on it. We figured to make a snow traverse leftward below a wall, then 
head up and behind the wall on rock if possible. I led the snow traverse, careful to make 
good steps as I rounded two or three ribs and lost sight of my partners. I remembered a 
story of a party nearly falling here on rotten snow high above the Depot Glacier. Happily, 
I found an entrance onto rock where I soon placed a hex and a titanium piton for a belay. 
But then I thought I'd keep climbing instead to make time, so I continued up the 4th-class 
rock in crampons. Pretty soon it felt kind of hard! After making some mixed snow/rock moves, 
and holding my breath on a delicate mantle I realized I needed to build a static belay. From 
a solid sling around a horn, I brought Robert and Theron up to the rock. Robert had the 
good idea to belay me higher from the piton/hex anchor at the base of the rock. I removed 
crampons and ran it out to the top of the rock step and a good stance. Here we had a choice 
to pursue the rock climb or exit the route normally via another few pitches in a steep snow 
couloir. We had reached the top of the ice face at noon, but now it was almost three. We 
also wondered which way to go around towers on the rock climb and were pretty sure that 
would take some time to figure out. So we decided on the regular finish. Theron was 
especially disappointed as he wanted to get out of his wet snow boots (he forgot to bring gaitors). 


Robert led a descending traverse off the rock into the couloir, then an interesting 
climb to an excellent belay cave in the moat between snow and rock, getting good rock
protection along the way. Another pitch of straightforward snow led to a high notch. 
Theron and I followed without crampons to save time, and emerged smiling at Robert's 
belay/picnic spot. We were happy to be done with technical climbing and eagerly 
divested ourselves of slings, nuts and screws. After a bagel and hummus, we descended 
a gully 100 feet, then made a delicate traverse on a brown ledge around the corner 
(unprotected 5th class, so we could avoid a creepy ice patch). We connected to the 
regular route, dropped our packs and scrambled up gullies for several hundred feet 
of enjoyable movement. We reached a mandatory steep snow couloir and cursed at 
leaving our axes below. No matter, we grabbed dagger-like rocks and followed Theron who
kicked good steps up to a steep notch with a "cannonhole." We crabbed through the hole, 
then scrambled steep and exposed rock on the north side. From here, Robert saw a sling 
atop a tower below, which we might have run into on the rock variation of the route. 
Soon we stood on the summit! 


We had to hang out a good while. I took off my boots and admired the north face of Bear 
Mountain, black and forbidding. Mt. Prophet looked pretty neat from the north. Sleese 
was an inspiring black tower. We recognized some names in the summit register, including 
Pete Schoening from 10 or so years back. We saw Sergio, Eric and Darin's names. The 
weather was warm and dry and the air was crystal clear in the near miles, although 
Rainier was almost lost in distant haze. 


We retraced our steps, Robert using his prussik cord to fashion a temporary backup to a 
handline at the top of the steep snow section. Once at our packs, we continued down loose 
ledges to snow, good for standing glissades and plunge stepping. Sections of rock and more 
snow led ever down to the south, finally placing us below the Flying Buttress after a last 
section of rock scrambling. A tiring walk up to a col, and then a long nearly-level journey 
across the Redoubt Glacier followed. Oh, I lacked courage to make a big jump from the ridge 
to the glacier until I got Theron to throw my pack down first for me. Still, it was hard to 
do, I kept thinking of myself with a broken ankle! But once the 10 foot jump was made, it 
seemed very easy. 


The late afternoon sun followed us down the glacier to slabs, then lower slabs that connected 
with our ascent trail of the morning. We arrived at camp very tired sometime before 8 pm, 
a 15 hour day. Robert was especially beat, citing lots of overtime and few mountain 
visits. He ate a little then went right to sleep. I followed and Theron trudged around 
a while before turning in as well. 


In the morning we slept in, no way would we clomp up 2000 feet of scree to hit the glacier 
below Spickard. Slowly we got ready, and started hiking down around 10 am. The trip was 
definitely easier than on the way in, and political conversations in the deep forest 
seemed to speed us up. Back near the car, Robert treated us to beers and salmon that he 
had thoughtfully brought for the occasion. Mmm...delicious!! 


On the drive out, we stopped at the west end of Chilliwack Lake where a beach invited us 
to go swimming. With Mount Redoubt visible high on the other side of the lake, we swam 
around in the cold water, happy for the chance to visit another high wild peak. 


Thanks to Robert and Theron for the great trip! Thanks to Drew for the info, 
and
Sergio Verdina and Darin Berdinka for web page beta 
(even though I had to retrieve Darin's
reports from www.archive.org!).
