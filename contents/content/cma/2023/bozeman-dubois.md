*205 miles, 28,600 feet elevation gain in total.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/segment7.jpg %}
*First 50 miles and almost 11,000 feet elevation gain after the night at
Robert and Julie's place to Mammoth.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/segment8.jpg %}
*Then 155 miles and 17,600 feet elevation gain from Mammoth to the pass
above Dubois, Wyoming.*

So, as reported in the previous report, Robert picked us up at the coffee
shop and took us to Bozeman. But first, along the way, we stopped at a
popular store in the area called Murdoch's. Remember I reported that Cory
lost his wallet, but it had been found? Well, the finder dropped the wallet
off for him at the Four Corners Murdoch's. Happily, Robert works for them,
and was able to arrange the hand-off with the manager there. I really like
how all that worked out. Basically, his wallet was kept safe for Cory
while he was out in the crime-ridden woods! Hee hee...

*Robert is the "CTO" for "Murdoch's", a major store in the west. Here he chats

*Me, Robert and Mark. It was 20 years ago that we went to the Bugaboos
together!*

We bought our food for the next leg of the trip, along with supplies for
a cookout on the grill (incredible burgers). We went to the house and met
Julie, and before long Mark Pratt came by, who I'd last seen 20 years
before! We settled in for a great evening of burgers, beer, hard cider and
conversation. Robert had really drilled into these mountains and knows
everything about every climb in the west. He skis, climbs rock and ice,
kayaks...this place is absolute heaven for him!

# July 27, Day 117

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day117.jpg %}
*8.6 miles, 2890 feet elevation gain.*

We slept in...so fantastic! I waddled down to breakfast as Cory snagged a
shower. Who did I see on a computer screen, but my ol' pal Theron...who
works with Robert nowadays!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/5-IMG_20230727_081750_MP.jpg %}
*Breakfast with Theron, who has a willow-like, etheral look here.*

While Robert rustled up some eggs, I chatted with Theron, who was shocked at
how old, tired and emaciated I looked. Well...what can I say? It's been a
rough haul from Helena, which was the last time I had a full rest day.
But we've moved fast, and that's been good, too.

Cory came down and we poured over maps. We had several options for the next
stretch. Robert had a book about hiking in Yellowstone, and a trail called
**Sky Rim** caught my eye. It said:

> A long, strenuous, spectacular ridgeline day hike for extra-fit hikers only.
> ...This might be my favorite hike in all of Yellowstone National Park.

Wow. In fact, that hike was one of the options. Another option was to just
walk the highway down to West Yellowstone, then turn east into the park.
Another, more ambitious, but now somewhat discarded, was to go far to
the east into the Absarokas. Nah...we want to get down to the Winds!

So we felt happy enough with a kind of compromise. The walk down to West
Yellowstone seemed lame. The Absarokas on the other hand, were too far.
Sky Rim and a turning south from Mammoth seemed like the good, middle way.
We'd finally re-join the CDT south of Grant Village near Heart Lake, about
a days march from the southern end of the park. We'd see more of the park
than most folks, but there would be a good bit of road walking there, too.

We went on a hunt for sunglasses, and Robert hooked us up with "Gooders,"
which were cheap but reliable. Later, back in Munich, I saw a guy wearing
these and asked if they were Gooders. He said yes, and of course, he turned
out to be from Bozeman!

Robert also got a bit of work done in the morning. It was late afternoon
by the time we got going back to the mountains. He and Mark planned to
kayak rapids of the Gallatin River which runs south to north between
Big Sky and Bozeman along the road. As we drove, it started to rain.
They altered their plans in various ways as we approached the trailhead.
Technically, Cory and I should begin the hike right in Big Sky, but...
we couldn't refuse a drive to the trailhead! I'm going to have to add
up and report the total mileage of such missed sections. I'm hoping
it's not a number TOO LARGE! Or I'll have to go back, ha ha...!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/10-IMG_20230727_203905_MP.jpg %}
*Another sunset picture.*

We said our goodbyes and started hiking behind a horse train. Eventually
they turned off and we could move faster. At one point it was raining
and we decided to rest and let the rain overtake and pass us. Cory
had a live radar somehow on his phone, and saw that if we waited about
30 minutes the storm would roll over us. Indeed that worked great!
We hunkered down under thick trees on dry duff as thunder and lightning
raged around us, and we were mostly dry. Then we picked up and walked
without rain to our camp in a meadow under Fortress Mountain.

The sunset was really gorgeous here, one of the best of the trip.
We lay down, pretty tired even though it was a short hiking day. All the
visiting and running errands takes energy too (though completely worth it!).

# July 28, Day 118

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day118.jpg %}
*22.3 miles, 4800 feet elevation gain.*

We dropped down to Ramshorn Lake, where apparently there had been bear
trouble recently, perhaps caused by pack train operators being a bit
careless with the grain fed to the horses. Before we could get up onto
Sky Rim, the trail indicated a descent into a valley and reclimb, however
I had a GPS track where someone elegantly avoided that. By following the
track closely, I saw that there was a trail...sure enough, we pieced this
together to come in a natural way up to Buffalo Horn Pass.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/11-IMG_20230728_094219_MP.jpg %}
*Cory and I enter Yellowstone National Park!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/12-DSC05689.jpg %}
*Cory on the slopes of Sky Rim.*

Once on the ridge south of the pass, we continued south and reached the
boundary of Yellowstone National Park in short order. Nice! I didn't know
the park extended into Montana...the ridge then bent east and took us in
many ups and downs towards its high point, with impressive views into
broad Montana valleys on the left side, and mysterious Wyoming country
on the right (to be technical about it, we were looking into Tom Miner
Basin on the left side).

Not a lot of words for this ridge, but plenty of pictures.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/13-DSC05694.jpg %}
*The ridge gains definition.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/14-IMG_20230728_102553_MP.jpg %}
*We actually saw a snowpatch in here.*

*Michael and the way ahead.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/16-DSC05700.jpg %}
*Cory and the southernmost Montana valleys behind.*



We'd tried using high points to contact the park authorities to figure
out where and how we could camp for the night. No one ever answered.
We met a man and some young people on the ridge, and he had worked for
the park service. He told us just to make our best effort but otherwise
be quiet, leave no trace of our passage, and just pass through. Technically
not correct, but it was hard to find other answers when they just don't
answer the phone.

Anyways, from the high point (reached without a trail just grinding up
a grassy mountain), we descended on trail to a lake. We decided not to go
down to the shore and get water because we should have some creeks as we
go further down.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/17-20230728_113904.jpg %}
*Michael on Sky Rim.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/18-IMG_20230728_114005_MP.jpg %}
*Big, open country up here.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/19-DSC05703.jpg %}
*Hilariously, the trail just disappeared here and we had to just grind
straight up the steep grass mountain ahead.*

In fact, though, it was a long and dry descent. Finally we could get
water at the junction with the High Lake Trail, here in the North
Fork Specimen Creek valley. We took off shoes and rested tiredly
by the creek, drinking water. An older couple came by, bound for
High Lake and camp. We were also supposed to go that way, but the
thousands of feet of climbing wore us out. We saw that we could descend
the valley then turn east into the East Fork along the Sportsman Lake Trail,
and eventually gain the same point. It did also offer us the chance to
leave the park and sleep by the road if we found that to be necessary.

So we hiked on, only running into people miles down the valley setting up
their tents for the evening. We turned into the east fork. At one point here
I left my sunglasses at a resting place and had to tiredly wander back for
them. We were beat!

*Cory powers down from the high point of Sky Rim.*

It was getting dark when we wandered into a designated wilderness camp.
Unfortunately a man was there and said that if we weren't permitted we had
to stay far away from him as he was a licensed horse packer. He basically
told us to leave and don't come back.

That was odd. Absolutely bushed, we turned around and headed back to the
trail in the dusk. There was another campsite about a mile on, though
off the trail a ways to the north. We made for that place, soaking our
feet at the end of the day crossing a marsh to reach the camp. Happily,
no one was here to be upset with us, so we set up our tents, quickly ate
and retreated from the mosquitoes.

A difficult end to an excellent day!

*Heading south in the North Fork of Specimen Creek.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/24-DSC05711.jpg %}
*The valley broadens, but still a long ways to go before we sleep.*

# July 29, Day 119

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day119.jpg %}
*19.2 miles, 3225 feet elevation gain.*

Easy miles through the forest and over a gentle pass to Sportsman Lake
today, and then on to Mammoth. We wondered what to do there. Would we
get there in time to talk to the rangers? Where could we sleep? Is
there a hotel? Can we buy food? It was all a bit of a mystery.
For now, we enjoyed the scenery in this big country...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/25-DSC05723.jpg %}
*Llamas not in the mist.*

We passed some resting llamas in the meadow near the lake, then started
climbing in earnest. Somewhere in the switchbacks, we entered Wyoming,
though there was no sign. We were climbing along Mol Heron Creek to
it's head, then turning east and climbing further to a beautiful
unnamed pass.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/26-DSC05724.jpg %}
*Cory powers manfully into Wyoming.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/27-DSC05728.jpg %}

{% image /cmaimages/2023/28-DSC05732.jpg %}
*A gorgeous ridge-arm above the Gardner River Valley, this day bedecked
with bison, though they'd moved on by the time I took the picture.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/29-20230729_120912.jpg %}
*Michael trying to be comfortable at the high pass.*

We rested at the pass and saw big brown shapes moving on an arm of high
country to our south. "I think those are buffalo," said Cory. He has really
good eyes. He was always spotting eagles, buffalo, goats, just whatever in
the distance. I finally saw them, but I couldn't always see what he saw.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/30-IMG_20230729_144703_MP.jpg %}
*Coming down into a land of forest, root and twig.*

*My typical posture when I'm not walking. Lying FLAT!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/32-20230729_150433.jpg %}
*For Cory and I both, different hot sauces were an essential pleasure
for snacks and dinner.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/33-IMG_20230729_161051_MP.jpg %}
*Cory continues west towards Mammoth.*

We traveled for a long time to the east, mostly descending. Eventually
we met day hikers now and again, all energetic and smelling of freshly
washed clothes. Eventually, under Sepulcher Mountain we met a park
administrator who spoke cagily of stealth sleeping opportunities around
Mammoth. The problem was that the campground was still closed to to the
flooding of 2022. So technically, there is nowhere to camp in Mammoth.

Pretty tired by this point, we emerged onto a narrow road and started
to smell sulphur. Steam vents everywhere! Before long we were in
milling crowds descending a series of walkways to the edge of town.
We'd been looking for camping places along the way, but as far as I was
concerned, they were too high up and too far back for me to make it up
there on this day! We'd just have to see what happened below...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/34-IMG_20230729_173103_MP.jpg %}
*Suddenly, we're in a kind of drive-through steam vent area above Mammoth.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/35-IMG_20230729_173957_MP.jpg %}
*The town lies defenseless below.*

We got to town and found a little store with some resupply options. And
a friendly employee who had hiked the Appalachian Trail. There was a
cafeteria where we could buy a sandwich and a drink. Great! The
wilderness ranger office was already closed. We'd have to try in the morning
there to get permits.

After the cafeteria closed, the place turned into a ghost town. We decided
to hitch down to Gardiner, Montana. A car came along and picked us up,
driven by a friendly Guatamalan teenager, with his girlfriend (Korean?)
in the passanger seat. She was a trip. They both worked in the park for
the summer and went down to the town in the evenings to fight boredom.

They dropped us off at a motor inn. We somehow got some dinner, but I don't
remember what. It had been a huge day. We figured to buy supplies in the
morning.

# July 30, Day 120

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day120.jpg %}
*21.7 miles, 2220 feet elevation gain.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/36-IMG_20230730_071711_MP.jpg %}
*Time to escape the motel in Gardiner, Montana.*

We'd been able to do laundry the night before, down the hall. In the morning
we went to the supermarket and had a big breakfast, too. We walked to
the edge of town and hitched a ride back up to the park at the park entrance.
It was from a young man associated with this incredible documentary
[Unbranded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swX4BLbmBNU&pp=ygUUdW5icmFuZGVkIGZ1bGwgbW92aWU%3D).
I'd seen it some years before and resolved to watch it again. We thanked him
and went into the wilderness office. There we were given permits
for the next 4 nights in the park. We'd have to get a permit for night
5, which would be in the wilderness near Heart Lake later. We had one
wilderness campsite and the other three were in frontcountry sites:
Canyon Village, Bridge Bay Campground and Grant Village.

We watched an obligatory bear safety movie. It was nice to sit in a chair
and not have to move! It had been a fun and friendly encounter with the
rangers, big thanks for that.

We went outside and started walking the road for 13 miles until we could
turn off on trail to our wilderness camp after another 10 miles.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/37-IMG_20230730_080748_MP.jpg %}
*Gardiner: a hunter's paradise!*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/38-IMG_20230730_150455_MP.jpg %}
*The season of road walking. Sometimes stressful!*

It sprinkled lightly now and then. We came to a scenic pull-out and a
muscular hispanic man with two grown sons was there. We started talking.
**It was my favorite interaction with strangers of the whole trip.**
His sons were mentally handicapped to some degree. They were so...
present, so interested in what we were doing. They were all smiles. One
of the young men tried on my pack. Their father was explaining our journey
to them, but I saw that they had their own reason to find what we
did exciting:

What we did *required no vehicle*. They were probably barred from driving a
car. In America, how must it feel to be a young man and know you'll never
be allowed to drive?

But here...here was a chance to side-step that difficulty and re-acquire
personal power, and in fact, it might even be a better way. They saw that
we were men happy to **escape** the world of cars. That we, in fact, regarded
foot travel as *even better* than moving through the land in a vehicle.

I just saw all of this in their eyes and questions. I felt so honored to
be able to give them something. To give them an idea.

I think we all gave each other hugs as we left. I was proud of their father,
too. They were from Florida. He looked like a big tough guy you'd see on
a beach there, full of muscles. But he always wants to lift up those boys.

As Cory and I walked again I had dreams of them hiking across the land.
Who knows? Even to know there is a door is often enough.

I was almost exhausted by the gift of that experience...but we were suddenly
in a difficult world. There was no shoulder on the road, and a good 10-11 miles
to go. There were traffic jams occasionally, caused by people looking at
bison or maybe a bison on the road. Some guy was angry and honked at us,
apparently believing that we were the cause of traffic. Oh no...most people
blew past us inches away from us in enormous camper vans. It was rattling
to see how little people cared. If there was room, sometimes the car would
swerve over into the oncoming lane. That was kind. But more rare than you'd
think.

The road is not friendly. However, here is something I didn't know about
Yellowstone: there aren't many trails. Basically, the trails are the road
and just a few lines here and there. Every day now we'd have to do at least
some, and sometimes most of our miles on the road.

Cory was particularly bothered at one point. He's a very safe driver and always
has high situational awareness. He couldn't believe the things he was seeing.
We would wave to get distracted drivers to look up from their phones and
see us. But after coming within a hairs-breadth of being hit a few times our
waves became more aggressive. Like...HEY THERE! HEY IDIOT...YOU SEE ME?

This was no good. We stopped at one point for a rest. Later, I decided to
dis-engage in order to preserve my mental health. Rather than take increasing
steps to protect myself from getting smooshed on the road, I'd just zone out
in headphones and try to ignore the cars. Frankly, whatever increased safety
margin I got wasn't worth the psychic frission, and in fact seemed to make
things worse, somehow. My "new age" tendencies come forth at times like this,
and I suspect that viewing the oncoming cars with eyes of suspicion and anger
has a way of bringing those qualities to the fore in the approaching drivers.

So...*ruhig bleiben*...(german for "be calm, quiet").

Therefore we were happy to leave the road, walking for miles along a powerline,
joking and wondering about the circumstances in which they built it.
We met a happy couple then came with them to a sulphuric pond. He had a
handgun and waved it around some (actually not legal in the park).
He was always worried about bears. When a
tree branch made a noise in the wind he said "what's that?!" and got the
pistol out.

Needless to say, we had a lot of fun with this character in the days
ahead. Nothing helps a thru-hiker like a strange personal encounter!

Finally they turned back. As it grew dark, we crossed a river then had to
use GPS to cross a meadow without any trail to zero in on our campsite.
Happily there was a bit of water there uncontaminated by sulphur.

*Sundown near our wilderness camp.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/40-IMG_20230730_204447_MP.jpg %}
*Cory muses over dinner.*

We found a wild frenchman with a long beard at our camp, who was stealth camping his way
across the park on a wild journey across the USA. He was talkative, and we
had to break away to be able to set up our tents and prepare dinner.
People like this make it clear that I'm not a real outdoorsman, I just play one
on tv sometimes. I'd grown addicted to using Corys stove for hot water in the
evening. My favorite dinner was ramen noodles with peanut butter, taco sauce,
and a few drops of olive oil that Cory carried. Somewhere in here I got a
fuel bottle and carried it in order to try and pay him back for the use of
the stove. If you have enough hot meals, you don't want to cold soak anymore!

I'd bought some small cigars in Gardiner, and smoked two of them out here
on a log, looking out to the sunset. Maybe because of the encounter with the young
men and their dad, it was a special night. We were in Wyoming. We'd walked
across Montana. All was well. What more could one ask?

# July 31, Day 121

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day121.jpg %}
*11 miles, 1000 feet elevation gain.*

No pictures today. Not much to say. We walked a few miles of trail
in the morning, having an engaging conversation, though I forgot the
subject. Then we hit the road and zoned out in headphones in order to
prevent a repeat of the stressful road situation the day before.

We were making for Canyon Village. We got there and went to a 50s
diner kind of restaurant for a burger. I had a deep conversation with a
young Indian (as in the subcontinent) man about metaphysics. Cory was
like "oh brother, Michael is in his element," and was probably glad
that someone else was there to help soak up my noise on the subject!

We bought a few supplies and went to the campground. The nice lady there
put us in a place right next to the main building. It was only a half day
of hiking so we were there early. We took a nap. I remember waking up to
a conversation between a man and woman with an enormous camper van nearby.
They were arguing about which generator to use for the afternoon. She
needed the one that the dvd player uses, I think.

Later, we took a shower at the main building. A happy french family came
in and put themselves into shower stalls, babbling all the while. I guess
they didn't have two generators and a jacuzzi parked outside. They must be
using tents. I think they were creating richer memories, personally.

We ran into a young woman named "Little Shark" who we'd seen at the ranger
station the day before. Cory also met her on the plane heading to Kalispell.
We'd see her on and off over the next days. She hitched here, there and everywhere,
seeing the whole park. She also walked plenty. But it illustrated a real difference
between men and womenfolk: women can *always* hitch. Men *might* get a hitch.
I regarded each successful hitchhike as a real victory. And I've had the
hour or more of being relentlessly passed, realizing I have to arrange for
some kind of shuttle because it just isn't happening. Women stick out their
thumb and it's done. The only thing that irritates me about this is that
the women who do this never imagine that their experience is special. They
just say "oh, why don't you hitch to X and then back, etc.?"

You can tell them that it's not so easy for a man, but they kind of look at
you like that doesn't compute and just repeat their suggestion.

"This is why we have to reincarnate, Cory," I said about it later. We simply
can't understand the experience of another. We have to go through it.
My personal outrage at the situation implies, to me, that I was a woman before,
and now, as a man, the wound of the unfairness feels "fresh." Truth be told,
guys agree with me about this problem, but their eyes are dull on the topic
as not worth wasting words on. So I'm fresh in the pool of this sex, I conclude.

A fine rest here, eager to spend most of the next day in the backcountry.

# August 1, Day 122

*21.7 miles, 1720 feet elevation gain.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/42-20230801_080157.jpg %}
*The Lower Falls of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.*

We walked to the Lower Falls of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (I
like saying that...sounds very important). Nice rock and dramatic
water. Continuing along the river, we finally crossed it and emerged
on trail on the east side that quickly took us into country that felt
open and remote.

Before another hour or two passed, we had bison on all sides of us.
This was a neat feeling.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/43-20230801_091317.jpg %}
*A bison on the great plain east of the Yellowstone River.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/44-IMG_20230801_092129_MP.jpg %}
*Cory crosses the plain, fully exposed to the wrath of the bison.*

We felt that grizzlies were in the trees watching the plain. And the bison
were not what I expected. I thought they would be like cows. But they
were more like some african animal...more muscular than I expected.
We had to climb a hillside to avoid one who stood in the trail and watched
us. He would occasionally roll in the dirt, then stand up again and track
us. Finally he stormed away.

In the small hills on the plain, we'd see little dust clouds, made when a
bison rolled in the dirt or took off running. At another point, we passed
the carcass of a baby bison which appeared to be in pieces. We walked
quickly through that area, knowing a bear had been behind that.

Later, we were in forest and stumbled upon a bison sitting in the trail
silently. Cory, as usual, saw it first, and got me to stop yammering on.
We then crept off the trail into the trees and gave him a wide berth.

This was turning out to be a huge wildlife day. It felt very consequential.
It was also funny to see traffic jams on the road in the distance at the
sight of a bison. Meanwhile, we were out here with them.

*Yellowstone Lake*.

We reached the Fishing Bridge Campground and went into the little store for
a snack, then had an interesting conversation with an old farmer woman
who had a curious "innocent" way about here. I liked her very much.
Later her son (or grandson?) arrived, but had a sallow, cynical look
that wasn't as nice.

Country people are often happier than they have a right to be. And their
sophisticated offspring are impoverished.

*An elk at the Bridge Bay Campground.*


We had dinner on the waterfront at Lake Village. Something like hot dogs
or chili dogs, which was kind of a park specialty. We walked a few more
miles to Bridge Bay Campground, got settled in for the night and enjoyed a
beer at our park bench. Elk wandered into camp and we all took pictures.
It had been a long and eventful day.

# August 2, Day 123

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day123.jpg %}
*16.9 miles, 1340 feet elevation gain.*

We started by getting our wilderness permit for the last night in the
park. Happily there was a space available on the west side of Heart Lake,
though I would have prefered the east side in order to cover more ground.
The rangers were very nice, though it was interesting to see that most of
them had little experience with backcountry camping. Lots of questions
about what we eat and how we live out there, which was funny!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/49-IMG_20230802_104655_MP.jpg %}
*Grizzly tracks (among many!) in the high country on the west side of
Yellowstone Lake.*

After walking a couple miles up the service road (for powerlines again) by
a feature called Natural Bridge, there was a sign that the road was closed
due to bear activity.

Well. I wasn't going back to the highway. At least after reading the carcass log.
Yes, because, helpfully, there was a "carcass log" right next to the sign.
We read that a few days before, two (not one, two!) bison had been struck
and killed by vehicles on the service road. This then attracted a mass of
bears. The carcass (carcaii?) was removed 2 days before. For this reason,
we thought it was safe now to travel the road.

But wow, when we got to the place mentioned in the log, tension was high!
In fact, we carried our bear spray in our hand. And we began seeing many,
many, MANY grizzly tracks. We saw sign that a carcass had been dragged
in the sand. We noted where each track left the road and imagined being watched.
Other than this drama, the high country here was interesting and we had a
good view of the lake shortly before the descent, though this was also
near the accident site, so we didn't linger.

We got down to the road and could relax, at least a bit. It began to rain as
we curved around the lake. We passed a collection of sulphur vents.

We entered the campground from the back side, piecing together bits of
trail with cross country travel. On registration, we got our place along
with some other CDT folks. Mike and Heather were here, last seen in the
stretch to Helena. After a rest, we walked into the Village for dinner.

This was pretty neat: we went into the bar of the "fancy" restaurant,
and the bartender paid for our drinks because she was also a thru-hiker.
Then we went to dinner, ordering a fancy, expensive meal with dessert.
We were amazed to learn that two women from the bar had paid for our meal
and left. They'd heard our story as reported by the friendly bartender,
were impressed and gave us this considerable gift.

Wow.

It's always a surprise to be noticed. We do our things and get used to working
away unseen, uncared for. That's fine, yeah? But sometimes someone sees.
I'd say to you that you are probably noticed a lot more than you think. And
sometimes, you're noticed to an astounding depth. You might learn about it
later. Or not.

We probably took a shower, though I don't quite remember. Rainy night.

# August 3, Day 124

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day124.jpg %}
*15.3 miles, 1100 feet elevation gain.*

The laundry room had a covered outdoor area. I tried drying my tent
here. The woman running that opened early so we could come in and warm
up. Really nice.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/50-IMG_20230803_075008_MP.jpg %}
*She opened early for us, got us coffee, gave us a place to dry things.
Home is also a feeling.*

We chatted with folks inside as we ate some breakfast. Later, we
walked over to the Village Store. I forgot why, but it ended up being
tough to leave. It was probably 10 by the time we were walking.

*Steam vents near Heart Lake.*

First miles on the road (7 or so?). Then trail, and for the first time
in weeks, we were back on the CDT. Back on the official trail, wow.

We crossed nondescript forest, coming out at some steam vents before
dropping to the lake and more vents nearby. After sitting a few minutes at
a closed up ranger cabin we felt the rain was going to really let loose,
and we should get to camp. Sure enough, 15-20 minutes later as we started
setting up
our tents, the rain started heavy and didn't stop for 30 hours.
We ate under umbrellas. I remember Cory's soaking hat dripping rain on
him. At least we had heat from his stove!

# August 4, Day 125

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day125.jpg %}
*20.1 miles, 2290 feet elevation gain.*

No pictures today. Just a struggle to keep the things that need to stay dry,
dry. I hated putting the wet tent into the main body of the pack, but that
was the right thing to do in permanent rain. The sleeping bag and warm jacket
were protected by a trash compactor bag. I hoped there were no tears in it!

Just a sopping journey, and a long one. A young man and woman passed us
by. At another point, Mike and Heather appeared. Heather walked with us a
while and became really keen on somehow building a fire. We'd seen a party
of campers in the morning gathered around a smoky fire. Maybe she saw that
too and it inspired her. Anyway, in the afternoon, she started looking for
dry wood in strategic hollows. I thought the project was doomed, and just
wanted to reach camp, set up the tent and begin getting warm with the help
of a (hopefully) dry sleeping bag.

We took our leave (she did give up on the idea, she reported later), and
kept walking. By lucky chance, we looked to the left on the trail right
at the park boundary and saw a cabin with the young man and woman drying their
things. Yes! We could sit on the porch and eat, increasing our chance of
getting into bed warm and dry.

We went over and hung out with them. This was fun. We got water here and
the rain actually stopped for a few minutes. We ate our hot meal on the
porch, as I'd hoped for. We exchanged rueful gossip about folks on the trail.
The great "social media butterflies" came in for particular derision.
Sorry y'all...you get enough love from the whole world -- you don't need us.

Cory and I walked just a few minutes to find a flat place in the trees.
We set our camp and went to bed.

# August 5, Day 126

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day126.jpg %}
*19.7 miles, 2940 feet elevation gain.*

We'd heard the weather would be better today. Mike and Heather wandered
by as we packed up. They'd camped nearby, but didn't see the cabin.

We crossed a wet Fox Park, fording streams several times, then started
climbing. Eventually we were in sun, much missed over the last days!
After some hours we came to a high and scenic plateau with a small
tarn. My head was full of the thought: DRY THE TENT! In fact, dry
everything! Because who knows when you'll get another chance.
There was a decent wind, and I knew that combined with sun would
rapidly dry anything.

*Cory in a sunny meadow, heading south.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/56-IMG_20230805_120451_MP.jpg %}
*Cory makes a call home on "Two Ocean Mountain."*

Our high point was a broad north-south summit of 10047 feet. I got my
tent lashed to a tree, laid socks and other things out to dry and set
about socializing and enjoying myself. A german man told us of his
adventure coming north. It sounded very tough. "Every day I push more...
I give 110%, but it's not enough. So I give 130% and still it was
not enough..." He sounded really fed up. But he knew he was lucky
to get to do this. The mental struggle is real.

My answer has been not to dwell on it. I've been impatient at times.
I've felt that what I'm doing is essentially boring or unnecessary.
But the more I think about that the worse I feel. No. I've decided to
complete this thing, and all those thoughts will just have to wait.
I think the german man has had a lot of time alone with nothing but his
own thoughts rattling around. This has been one of the good things about
hiking with Cory. I did sometimes want more alone time. But constant alone
time is not good for me. I'd probably get "fed up" like this guy did.
Still, I hope he finished his hike and gets to look back on all the ups and
downs with pride.

*With Mike and Heather on "Two Ocean Mountain."*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/59-DSC05751.jpg %}
*Cliffs on the west wall of the North Two Ocean Creek valley.*

We didn't even bother taking a picture of "Two Ocean Creek," which splits
here, going to the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. I mean...we're on the divide...
we are constantly seeing that kind of thing!

At the base of this mountain, we came upon the new thing which would bedevil
us for the next days: HORSES.

My gosh...horses destroy trails. Huge mud pits. Tremendous effort expended at
times to stay out of the ankle deep mud. Sometimes sloshing right through
like a Vietnam rice paddy. We were in a land of private horse ranches which
took parties out constantly.

We passed one horse camp. Maybe 2 dozen people and horses? Anyway, we descended
the valley in steps. Things broadened out and it became easier to avoid the
mud pits. We came to a camp in the North Fork Meadows with water near by.
Mike and Heather were already here. We had dinner with them as rain began
to sprinkle. I didn't mind though, everything was dry. I could hope that there
would be a chance again the next day to dry things out.

# August 6, Day 127

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day127.jpg %}
*17.5 miles, 3460 feet elevation gain.*

I had studied the trail for the day ahead and knew that folks often
made an error, failing to turn left on an obscure branch to cross
the river.

Therefore we got it right. However the trail became really indistinct,
and it was like we were going cross country down the hill to the river
ford.

In fact, this country was a lot like the Bob Marshall Wilderness further
north: lots and lots of deep river crossings. The country was just full
of water. I think it was clear and sunny for now, but eventually the
rain would come, I knew.

We went a long ways to the east, and missed our turn off because I was
upset at being all wet from the brush. I think I'd managed to keep my
feet dry for a few hours, then suddenly fell into a water hole. For
whatever reason I decided to run in order to burn off anger. But I ran
right passed our turn off.

So we lost a half hour or so eventually figuring out we had to turn around...

We did this, and started hiking up a mountainside. By now I'd learned that
the horse destruction on the trail was always worse on north-facing slopes,
because they hold more water. Ascending a north slope again, my fears were
confirmed. Grr! Looking at these oceans of mud and dozens of pock-mark
horse-foot-sized holes of brown water and slick mud for hours and hours
really gets to me. I was becoming easily irritated in this stretch.

I told Cory I simply had to stop in Dubois for a rest day. In a way, that
didn't make sense since we had a resupply box coming to the Benchmark
Wilderness Ranch near the pass. But it had been over twenty days since
a full rest day. The rain and horse-holes were driving me a bit crazy.
Also, and this would be a growing problem, I hated the thought that Cory
was slowed down by me because he needed to complete the whole trail this year.
I had visions of him shivering in the Colorado San Juans because he gave
in to my constant requirements of 20 mile days. Whereas, he often mentioned,
he could put his head down and pound out much longer days.

The deeper into Wyoming we got the more this bothered me. And so I expressed
my desire for a rest day more like "I'll stop for a rest day, but you
don't have to." This was perhaps rude, because the truth was, he was a great
guy to hike with and we were a productive team -- and friends besides.
I felt like he *should* go on faster. I guess I thought I would in his
shoes. And so I felt in his debt, and that made me occasionally irritable
(I also couldn't really articulate this at the time).

{% image /cmaimages/2023/62-DSC05760.jpg %}
*This picture is from Upper Nowlin Meadow, in a beautiful
notch between Terrace and Smokehouse Mountains.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/63-DSC05761.jpg %}
*Looking up from the meadow to the cliffs of Smokehouse Mountain.*

So anyway, we climbed along, separating here and there, listening to
music. The sky was filling with clouds though we still had sun.
We needed to cross one more river before we could climb up to a plateau
at Brooks Lake which meant Highway 26 was close. The descent to the river
was odd...long switchbacks that seemed a little bit pointless, but the
ground was fairly steep.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/64-DSC05763.jpg %}
*Looking into the complex terrain of the South Buffalo Fork River, which
we need to cross. We'll climb up onto the arm of the peak directly
across, then continue south.*

{% image /cmaimages/2023/65-IMG_20230806_141844_MP.jpg %}
*Climbing above the South Buffalo Fork, as rain threatens.*

We finally got down to the river and I have to say it was the most difficult
crossing of the entire trip. The river was powerful and the water was
fairly high. Cory was extremely thoughtful, and remained strategically
behind me as I carefully placed each foot in the thigh-deep water.
In a way, this irritated me, though that is only a reflection of my
poor character. I was becoming convinced that he was going slower than he
*should go*, and just because of me. So each extra kindness he gave me reminded
me of this uncomfortable idea -- that I was becoming a burden.

This is entirely a product of my own kinked and stunted thought, I know.
In fact, Cory was just being the considerate and thoughtful dude that he
is. Haha...so you see my inner environment was getting a little bit miserable
in here, to match the weather!

But I was also proud of the crossing. It felt like we'd really been in
wilderness these last days. We climbed and the rain let up for a while.
Views increased, and my mood with them. However, after a couple hours,
the rain increased again, this time with a cold wind. I thought we should
set up camp before it started coming down really hard. I was looking at the
map ahead and it didn't look good for camping in the next miles. So when a
small flat spot under some rather dead-looking trees appeared, I wanted to
stop.

We did so, me feeling a bit guilty for relaxing the rule about camping only
around healthy trees. In fact, a tree that my tent was tied to did make
strange noises throughout the night. And we also heard a tree crash into the
ground before sleep.

Anyway, we had our wet camp. I actually cooked in the tent, going out in the
wet to retrieve the stove from Cory. Looks like I'm a real stove guy, now.

It was fairly early. I started kicking myself for forcing a stop when we could
have done another three miles. Mike and Heather came by. We said we'd see
them in Dubois, as they were stepping out for a rest too.

# August 7, Day 128

{% image /cmaimages/2023/day128.jpg %}
*10.9 miles, 1596 feet elevation gain.*

Let's go before it starts raining again! Ugh though...cold tent...cold
hands...wet tent...

{% image /cmaimages/2023/66-IMG_20230807_072015_MP.jpg %}
*It's 7:15 in the morning in the Teton Wilderness. Where are you right now?*

But movement brings energy. Sure enough though, the north slope was full of
horse-mud. As we reached the high point, I took off running. I wanted to be
alone, somehow, and after watching two or three people pass us by stomping
directly in the mud, I felt I was being too dainty in my steps. I was tired
of being passed!

In fact, I caught all these people and ran passed them in the next two hours.

{% image /cmaimages/2023/67-IMG_20230807_103003_MP.jpg %}
*Approaching Brooks Lake in sopping, marshy, flooded trail and meadow.*

At one point, the trail turned into an absolute mud-rink...icy and slippery.
I left the trail and stormed across a meadow. In reality, it was a shallow
lake. Sloshing along for a mile in here, I actually gained ground on a person
slipping and sliding their way along over on the trail on my left. Grr!
I wanted out, out, out!

{% image /cmaimages/2023/68-IMG_20230807_105157_MP.jpg %}
*Cory and friendly fetch-playing dog at the Brooks Lake Lodge, sorting out
our resupply.*

There was a final river crossing where I alarmed a young women with the
violence of my sloshing, slapping yet grinning assault on the river. I
tripped, became covered in mud, but just didn't care and kept going.
I caught a fellow and used him to distract me by making conversation.
I passed him, and pressed on to the Brooks Lake Mountain Lodge.

Once there I calmed down again and became civilized. A nice young woman
inside found my package and directed me to a table outside where I could
open it, drink water and charge a phone. I only had to wait a couple minutes
for Cory. He arrived agog at my mad dash into the sopping valley!

We played fetch with a dog and slowly digested our resupply. We were going
to town though, anyway. So we lifted up our packs and walked the road a couple
miles to a turn off down to Highway 26 after another couple of miles.

We got there and, to our dismay, there was very little traffic. Worse, a
man and woman came out and wanted to hitch too. After they saw how little
success Cory and I were having (me, covered in mud), they went in front
of us, and the woman made sure that as much skin showed on her legs
as possible.

Sigh. So we'd have to wait for them to get a ride, then maybe we could
get one.

Meanwhile, Cory tried to find some numbers for a shuttle, but that didn't
work.

In the end we were saved by a bear attack.

A surveyer had been stalked by a grizzly a mile up the highway earlier in
the day. A truck came by and loaded up the young man and woman ahead of us.
Then, mercifully, they pulled over to pick us up too and we piled into the
bed of the truck. The woman in the passenger seat said the grizzly was
coming down along the highway towards us, and that's why she picked us up.

Okay. Cool. I can live with that. Muddy and wet, and just worn out, I was
happy to be zooming to Dubois.
