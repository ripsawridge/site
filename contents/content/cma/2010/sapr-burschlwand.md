Adrian, a new partner, and I got in a half day here. Despite a few difficulties
climbing with each other for the first time, we climbed some good pitches. We
climbed the <a
href="https://www.burschlwand.at/burschl4_kletterrouten.htm">main wall</a> two
times. Great sustained climbing! We did 10 pitches between VI and VII- (5.9 and
5.10c in the YDS scale). Detailed notes:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Unterländerweg P1 (VII-)</b>
</td>
<td>Adrian led, very nice, felt a bit insecure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Unterländerweg P2 (VI+)</b>
</td>
<td>Michael. Hold broke at the crux and I fell. Rather dramatic. But nice moves in the crux area all the same (even without the hold :)).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Unterländerweg P3 (VI+)</b>
</td>
<td>Adrian. Nice steep climbing on an outside corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Mon Cheri P4 (VI) & P5 (VI)</b>
</td>
<td>Adrian. We lost Unterländerweg because the bolt hangers were gone. Adrian combined these two nice pitches for a long steep wall with flakes and incuts. Best pitch so far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Mon Cheri P6 (VI+)</b>
</td>
<td>Michael. Climbed a face just right of an easier ridge. Nice, some delicate moves. We hike down to start again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Donna Delores P1 (VI+)</b>
</td>
<td>Michael. Really enjoyable ridge and steep yellow face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Donna Delores P2 (VI+)</b>
</td>
<td>Adrian. Continuously delicate, "face to the wall" climbing. Looks very impressive and improbable for the grade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Donna Delores P3 (VI)</b>
</td>
<td>Michael. Long, left-trending pitch on a steep wall (though not as steep as the previous pitch). Route finding error led me too far left, then some difficulties getting back to my line. Later I needed to back clean several pieces. Found this a great pitch for endurance, but irritated my partner with all the delays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Donna Delores P4 (VI)</b>
</td>
<td>Adrian. Nice climbing straight up with a few thin flakes to supplement the continual sidepulls and shallow holds. Ends with a slight overhang, aided by bigger holds on the left side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Unterländerweg P6 (VI)</b>
</td>
<td>Michael. This is the easier ridge to the left of "Mon Cheri P6." By far the easiest pitch of the day.</td>
</tr>
