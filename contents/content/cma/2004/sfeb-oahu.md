### Oahu Hike - Lanipo Ridge, Feb 27, 2004
I had the morning free to hike, so I hiked/ran up the Lanipo Ridge
trail in a strong wind. There was supposed to be a big storm
coming. The trail was beautiful, with a steep drop-off on either
side of the narrow ridge for it's 3.5 mile length. There were many
ups and downs. Eventually I entered a cloud, so my views of
windward-side Oahu were obscured. I hiked down, then the downpour
arrived: horizontal sheets of rain got me soaked. Good trail!
