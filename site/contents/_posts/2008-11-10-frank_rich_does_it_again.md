> For eight years, we've been told by those in power that we are small,

> toxic catechism of Bush-Rove politics. It was the soiled banner picked
> up by the sad McCain campaign, and it was often abetted by an amen corner
> in the dominant news media. We heard this slander of America so often that
> we all started to believe it, liberals most certainly included. ...
>   
>   
> So let's be blunt. Almost every assumption about America that was taken
> as a given by our political culture on Tuesday morning was proved wrong
> by Tuesday night.
