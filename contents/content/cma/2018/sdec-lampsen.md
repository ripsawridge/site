I made a quick ski tour up the Lampsenspitze (2876 m). It's probably my fifth
time up there! It's just a great peak, hard to beat.

A few pics...

Looking to Innsbruck and points further east along the Inn.

Absolutely freezing my butt off. I went down to a wind-protected place.
Right on the true summit was frostbite city.

A trio of fellows heading up. People will just go up all afternoon and 
into the evening on this peak.
