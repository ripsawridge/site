### Wallberg and Setzberg
<i>May 5, 2012</i>

Morning hike on a day when the rain held off. Really nice time. I took new
routes on the way up, wandering up an old ski descent, then cutting cross
country up a steep forested rib. I re-emerged on the road, then dived back into
the forest. After Wallberg I had some apfelstruedel and cappucino at the
restaurant. Then I hiked over to climb Setzberg, kicking steps in my tennis
shoes for the last 150 meters of snow. A nice walk down that included some new
off-trail variants. Pretty soon I won't use any trails on this hike! 1200
meters up/down, couple of hours.
