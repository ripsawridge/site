Below the Kaindlhuette


Georg and I planned to go climbing for the weekend but the weather forecast
didn't support it. Drat! It hasn't been a great July, weather-wise. It looked
like we'd have a few hours Saturday morning before the rain. I decided on the
Ostler route on Scheffauer, rated IV (about 5.6 YDS), and 14 pitches. Every
pitch is grade II or III, and only the last pitch is harder. It seemed like we
could mostly solo it, and just use the rope near the end. The route is noted for
being quite exposed for the easy grade.

But Georg had an exhausting day Friday, so he had to cancel. I decided to go
myself, bringing rock shoes and a helmet. There were some "bail out"
opportunities on the route, and I'd take them if the rain came or if I felt
sketchy.

I parked at Hintertux, 250 meters above Kufstein, though, in hindsight, I regret
it. There was one spot on the grass next to a house, and I worried that my car
would be towed or that I'd come back to an angry crowd! Next time, I'll park
down in Kufstein. The 30 minutes I "saved" were lost in driving around and
trying to find the well-hidden road up to Hintertux.

I've never made this hike because it seems so boring. But now it was more
interesting for having never been visited. Roads and occasional trails led
passed the Duxer Alm, underneath a seemingly abandoned rusty chairlift. I
finally reached the Brentenjoch at 1272 meters, then jogged down to where the
road meets the Gaisbach, then hiked up past the Steinberghuette to the
Kaindlhuette. After all these confusing landmarks, it was easy to follow the
Widauersteig to a small basin below the North Wall.

Here was me at this moment in time

The Great Slab



It took me two hours from the car to this point. I ate a candy bar, switched to
rock shoes and looked up at the wall. I heard voices and saw a person moving
high above, on the 10th pitch...crossing the massive blue-white slab that marks
the upper face. Wow! Gulp...

I started up, resolving to keep track of where I was by always finding and
marking the belay stations. Excellent scrambling followed on decent to excellent
rock. The pitches flew by, with easy route finding. The fourth pitch enters a
basin left of the slab, then climbs out of it on a distinct ridge for several
pitches. Happily the weather was holding.

On pitch 8, by a piton in the wall there was a rather spicy move with a lot of
exposure. And on pitch 9 there was an unexpected difficulty. By a bolt, I wasn't
sure if the route went straight up, or down into a dark, wet gully. Going up
looked quite steep!

Finally I resolved the question, and started carefully up. All the holds were
good, but extreme care was required. I was absolutely aware of every limb, every
point of balance. Each hold got extra scrutiny for movement, every foothold was
carefully vetted.

The upper Widauersteig, a neat hike



After this enjoyable but demanding pitch I looked up at the last 5 pitches and
was completely intimidated by the great slab. Without even thinking about it I
demurred immediately! Naw, I thought. The slab was only grade III, but that
combined with the fact of a grade IV pitch right at the end, and the unpleasant
possibility of having to downclimb the slab in case of problems...

I was at the last chance to escape the route, so I took it. Now I climbed
pleasant scrambling terrain up gullies and corners to eventually reach the
trail. I think I was on the face for about 1.5 hours.

I made the short hike to the summit, stopping to pause and look down the exit
pitch of the Ostler, marked by a couple of bolts. Yeah...doesn't look so bad,
but I needed a partner for that! I'd be happy to come back sometime!

I hung out a while, then descended the Widauersteig to get a beer and cake at
the Kaindlhuette. This made me sleepy, so below the hut I took a short nap in a
meadow. The sky had filled with clouds and a cold wind. The face was covered in
cloud. The weather was here!

On the hike down it started raining. This was a very enjoyable trip! About 1500
meters up and down. Too bad Georg couldn't make it, but we'll be back then!
