I snowshoed up the ski trail of Wallberg in fresh snow. That was fun, but I wish
I had skis for the trip down! I headed back down from the lift station, running
into the annoying problem that my snowshoes are pretty much broken. I switched
over to the trail for the lower half down which took so much longer.

After a short rest I headed up again on the road/trail. Why not, eh? At the lift
station, I took the lift down for 1800 meters elevation gain and 900 meters
descent for the day.
