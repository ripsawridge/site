# June 17, Day 58

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage11.jpg %}
20 miles, 7175 feet elevation gain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day58.jpg %}
Day 58, showing the climb of Mount Elbert.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220617_060857_MP.jpg %}
Blue the dog in the van.

The plan was definitely to climb Mount Elbert along the way.
Mishap and Gargoyle also planned to climb Mount Massive for
an absolutely huge day. I was like "no way!" Leftovers also
demurred from Mount Elbert. I could see how happy he was to
have an easy day walking in the forest, and felt a bit
envious. But I simply couldn't leave out the 2nd highest
peak in the continental United States, eclipsed only by
Mount Whitney in California! Ach...

Mishaps mom drove us to a spot on the road on the west side
of Twin Lakes where we could follow a road up. I think this
was a shortcut that cut off a mile or so of the red line.
We started out. Pretty soon me and Leftovers were walking
together. I said goodbye somewhat sadly, imagining all the
nice naps Leftovers would get to have on the main trail.
I turned up to the west on the Mount Elbert trail. Pretty
soon I was passing some families out for a hike of the
peak. Some people were already coming down, which was a
good idea because the afternoon thunderstorms were beginning.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04580.jpg %}
The middle slopes of Mount Elbert, above the trees, but
still the summit is a long ways away.


I [listened to a heartbreaking podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/eric-carroll-the-disaster-of-family-court/id1533933447?i=1000565121201) about family courts
in the USA. Apparently, there is a need for safe "handoff sites"
for divorced fathers to pick up their children for a
visiting weekend. It happens quite often that a divorced
mother is enraged at the father, and she'll create accusations
that the father has abused the child/children in some way.
Then, a male member of her family takes it upon himself to
defend the honor of the family by killing the father. These
things happen when he comes to pick up the child for visitation.
It has happened pretty often (see the [John Mast documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_z0AfxT2bE)). And the charges are usually
groundless (if they weren't, the law would have intervened
already). In our modern world, we point fingers at men for
being violent, and women get a pass. However, women often
execute violence by proxy...that is, they get a male to
perform the violence nurtured in their hearts.

Depressing media material notwithstanding, the country was
gorgeous. Gradually, the broad ridge narrowed and defined
itself above the surrounding country. I admired the ridge
I'd descend later, off to the right and looking spectacular.
I knew Mishap was somewhere ahead (later, she texted that
she saw me getting water below). Gargoyle was probably far
ahead.

It was fun to have a day pack, that's for sure!

I met Mishap at the summit and we asked around for a little
cardboard sign folks had made with the name of the peak.
Somebody took some pictures of us. This was my first Colorado
"fourteener," since I skipped out on San Luis Peak at the
tail end of the San Juans. The views were incredible. I really
like this early summer look of high Colorado peaks, with
snowfields alternating with tundra. We saw back into the Sawatch
where we'd spent so many toilsome days!

We hiked down together. Storm clouds were brewing, so we
moved without stopping until we got down into the trees.
Mishap met a volunteer trail worker who knew a part of the
Appalachain Trail that they both remembered fondly.
We separated for a while as it rained lightly in the forest.
Later, the rain got heavier. I crossed Halfmoon Creek, then
climbed 1000 feet tiredly up the other side. It was a long
rainy walk for a while...

Later, I followed the Native Lake Trail downhill to the right
in order to reach a fish hatchery where Mishap's Mom was
picking us up. Near the hatchery, the forest was
beautiful with boulders of various size intermixed with
light forest on a broad, pine-needled floor. Mishap came
along and we walked the final bits of trail to the
parking lot. We ate snacks and drank sodas until all five
of us and the dog Blue were together again. The rain
had stopped, and it was a pleasant late afternoon. It had
been 21 miles and 5780 feet elevation up and down. Whew!

We went to Leadville for dinner and a hotel.
Because we didn't want to wait an hour for a table, we
went to an odd little Chinese restaurant run by an old
lady with a lot of character. She would tease or scold
us in various ways. We were the only people in the restaurant!
Detour showed up and shared stories of sleeping on summits
in the last days.

# June 18, Day 59

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage12.jpg %}
19.9 miles, 5154 feet elevation gain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day59.jpg %}
A long day of mostly forest hiking.

In the morning, we were back at the fish hatchery to walk up and
over a forested pass to reach Turquoise Lake. Once there, we
climbed again into a zone of alpine lakes, remnant snow and
forest, with the true crest on our left side. Gargoyle was
walking on that in some fashion. I could see some dramatic
cornices up there. I was happy with a gorgeous granite slab to
practice some rock climbing. This time, I had my umbrella for the
afternoon rain showers.

After the lake and granite climbing, the trail meanders through
open forest for many miles. Near the end, there was a little
rocking bench for a nice rest.

It was 20.2 miles and 4680 feet up and down, almost as much
as the day before with the climb of Mount Elbert. Don't
underestimate these "forest days," you can really rack up
elevation!

We also saw Google and other folks camping in the trees along
the way, with more people camping at Tennessee Pass. We got
to the pass, and Mishap's Mom pulled up just when it started
to rain really hard. Whew! Down to Leadville for pizza and
beer :).

# June 19, Day 60

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage13.jpg %}
21 miles, 4073 feet elevation gain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day60.jpg %}
From Tennessee Pass to Copper Mountain ski area.

For the last day of slack packing, we'd walk from Tennessee Pass
to the Copper Mountain ski resort. Leftovers and I followed the
road to shave off about a mile of walking, while Mishap and
Gargoyle stuck to the red line. After some miles, Blue the dog
joined them.

In Cataract Creek, where the trail climbs back up to
Kokyo Pass, Leftovers and I were briefly discouraged. He
even thought about calling it a day. I felt almost the
same, this being day 7 of a stretch without a rest day.
Keeping up with these young folks was getting tough!
But, knowing that I'd get a rest tomorrow, I ground it
out, making for the pass in cold, spitting rain.

I passed a tent where folks were waiting out the
weather. From the pass, I walked the high country for a few hours to Searle Pass.

Leftovers and I occasionally met up and joked about one thing or
another. I think this was our most companionable day together.
By now, we knew each other pretty well and could poke fun
at our tendencies. I let him walk on ahead of me at some point,
as my feet were really hurting and I needed to slow down
and take some ibuprofen.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04597.jpg %}

Pass.

Eventually, I descended to the resort, where
Leftovers had found a brew pub. We ate a great dinner there. I was
very happy because finally we'd earned a rest day, after seven
days and 140 miles of tough mountains! This day was 21 miles
and 3330 feet of elevation gain/loss.

It was a very scenic drive back to Leadville along the
east shore of the Mayflower Tailings Pond in the sunset.
We looked up to the crests where we'd been walking. Mishaps
Mom was amazed that we were up there only hours before.
I thought how great it was that she could share in what her
daughter was doing. Also great that Blue was able to get in
some long walks with Mishap. Blue was a wonderful dog.

# June 20, Day 61

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220620_201117_MP.jpg %}
I am responsiblah for the grill.


Rest day! Leftovers and I were of the same mind: stick around
the house and don't move far from the bed/couch!

I worked on the blog and nursed a sore shoulder. The cause
seemed a mix of too many mosquitoe bites... Maybe even a spider
bite? But also an overuse injury from leaning on my poles too
hard. I hope it gets better...

In the evening we had a grill feast, inviting Google, Pecarino,
Lush and Shredder over for dinner. We had a big plan for the next
two days, and I tried to sleep early, though shoulder pain made
it hard...

{% image /cmaimages/2022/IMG_20220620_202403_MP.jpg %}
Preparing a fine dinner in Leadville.

That was the greatest dinner of the whole trip. It was fun
that we made it ourselves, and shared it with others, too.

# June 21, Day 62

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage14.jpg %}
27.3 miles, 9976 feet elevation gain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day62.jpg %}
Exciting day, short in miles but outrageous in elevation
gain.



Some bad weather was coming soon, and Mishap had a clever
plan to beat it. Thanks to her mom's help, we could start
anywhere and travel any direction. The idea was to hike
the section south of I70 with the highest section of the
whole CDT before the weather turned. We'd hike south for
two days, then mop up the section between Copper Mountain
and a remote location on the Swan River where Mishaps mom could
pick us up.

Sounds good! Mishaps mom drove us as close to the trail
head as she could, which was about a mile up a steep
dirt road exiting off I70. It was quite an adventure for
her! We hopped out, heading south and up into the great
basin with the Grays Peak Trail. I got generally in
front of Mishap and Leftovers for this section.
Gargoyle had left us the evening before, preferring
to do this section in a long push heading north.

I had one problem...we'd be without water for up to
a full day with our plan to leave the red line and travel
directly on the crest south of Grays Peak, and...one of
my two water bottles fell out of my pack in the truck.

I met a man (Chris) coming down from the peak and asked him if
he had a spare water bottle. He didn't, but he had one
of those expensive REI plastic bottles which he
generously gave to me. Oh gosh, this was such a great gift.
I was quite worried about staying on the crest if I
didn't have an extra water container. I would have had
to go down into the valley if I didn't have it.

Thank you Chris!

The hike to the summit was enjoyable. I was reminded of
the Alps in this section. The trail was reasonably full
of people -- what a contrast with other sections.

At the summit I settled in to wait. I was nervous
about the next section. We'd read many comments by others
about how steep it was. A little family of mountain goats
came along and posed in a friendly way. A little baby
goat gamboled.

Once the three of us got our fill from this high point,
we started down to a notch, the first of several before
reaching Mount Edwards. I was a bit crabby in here,
not entirely sure of the wisdom of staying on the crest.
In fact, Mishap and I got on each others nerves. There
was a lot of "I know that. Don't you think I know that?"
kind of discussion. Or I'd make a joke and she wouldn't
see the humor. Or vice-versa, I guess. Happily for
Leftovers, he seemed immune from these petty activities.

In truth, the trail was never any problem. Of course, we'd
been smart (and lucky) and were travelling it in the
best possible condition: bright late morning sunlight after
days of settled weather with little snow. We got some
very scenic photos in here.

I gleefully avoided the summit of Mount Edwards, really happy
to shave off 200 feet of elevation gain in what I knew would
be a monster day no matter how I sliced it. Down from the
summit we had a bit of luck: a remnant snowfield with
a trickling stream of water. Yes! So we'd have some water for
the next hard 15+ miles of ridgetop travel.

Later, I wondered if this is where I got giardia, as there
was sign of elk around here. I'd gotten spotty with treating
my water in the last weeks, and would soon begin the payments
for that! (hint: those payments lasted for months).

We descended a bit to Argentine Pass, below which sat a truck
bringing people to the high country for some reason.
Goodies? Snacks? I wondered. But the truck was too far away
to contemplate going down there!

With the red line heading down to the valley from here, I
set off steeply up towards Argentine Peak. Okay, we are
committed! By now I was pretty tired and the afternoon
grew late. The sky was a mix of heavy clouds in some areas,
and sun in others. Sometimes it grew cold and windy, then
became fine again.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04646.jpg %}
Moving upward on thin scratch of trail.

Weirdly, a powerline goes over the ridge on the other side
of the peak, and there is a little emergency hut of some
kind. It was too early to stop, so I didn't investigate it.
In general though, I was always worried about the wind up
here, knowing that if it was strong enough and I couldn't
find any protection, sleep might consist of me wrapping
myself up in my tent like a burrito and laying there until
morning.

The ridge down from Argentine was quite dramatic...quite
steep and I had to look carefully for the right way.
I reached a saddle before Decatur Mountain and decided this
is probably the right place to camp. I didn't know how far
behind me Mishap and Leftovers were, and I knew we should
stay closer together on this off-trail stuff.

So I set up my tent and enjoyed the view of Grays Peak and
other mountains. It was "international hike naked day," and
I paraded around naked for a while. After an hour or
so, Mishap and Leftovers came down the ridge and had to
endure the sight of me posing dramatically nude on various
outcrops. Leftovers set up his tent and retreated inside,
refusing to participate in such shinanigans. Mishap briefly
celebrated the day, though she really would have preferred
to get a picture on the summit of Grays in her birthday suit.
"But it was covered with kids and stuff!" I said. Or,
alternatively, Edwards Peak but I messed up that plan with
my gleeful avoidance of the summit.

Anyway, Mishap felt I'd made an error by camping so early.
In fact, we'd only hiked 11 miles, though it was the biggest
elevation day of the whole trail at 6500 feet elevation gain.
That's a big reason why I stopped! She said she can't sleep
if she stops to early, and besides, I snored and would
make that even harder. "Well just go keep walking then!"
I thought.

I include all this to say that, despite the best of intentions,
hikers can get on each others nerves. The truth is, even
though we didn't see things the same, she had good reasons for
seeing things the way she did. But I did too, and this
might be why "trail families" don't always last forever.
People want different things and move at different rates of
speed in order to keep an internal balance with all of the
things that are affecting them.

I saw a movie recently with a scene where a young man discovers
girls and asks a wise man why girls are so different. He said
that according to Saint Thomas of Aquinas, it is because they
have 5% more water, and so, are affected differently by gravity.

Ha! That is funny, but I see some truth in it...not only between
men and women, but between all individuals. It's as if inside
we have a small ocean of a unique size. Gravitational forces
move it suitably or painfully in multiple directions...listing
to the side one day, and stretched impossibly between diverse
points of gravitational power on another day. With more or
less mass in a different person, they may not be affected
at all...or, may be affected to a totalizing degree, such
that what looks uncertain and ambiguous to their companion
is plain as day to them.

Anyway, I was determined to enjoy the longer evening here.
I read and ate, watching the changing patterns of sun and
shadow on the peaks all around. It was an exposed ridge with
no trail anywhere near us, just the scratch of a few dozen
footprints from other hikers. We saw no one until the
afternoon of the next day.

Looking back to Grays Peak. We traveled the spine rightward
from the summit to this camp spot.

the left, and off out of sight to Decatur Mountain and
beyond.

# June 22, Day 63

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day63.jpg %}
An incredible amount of up and down and up!

In the morning, Mishap was off first, and I followed. After
picking my way below a snowy section, I climbed steeply down a
trail amid large blocks. Suddenly, I lost my balance when I
misplaced a hiking pole -- I was in the air!

I flipped head over heels, then landed painfully first on my
knees, then my chest. Groaning and yelling with the pain, I lay
there a while, grateful that nothing seemed to be broken. Mishap
came running up from her perch at the next saddle to see if she
could help. Moral comfort was indeed helpful, and after a few
minutes we went back to her spot.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/DSC04653.jpg %}
Mishap points to a white pixel she believes is a goat
down at Shelf Lake.

Feeling a bit demoralised, and wondering what this would cost me
in new bruises, I sat and tried to regain my excitement for the
ridge. I knew we had a tremendous amount of work in front of us,
and later, was happy to find that we could bail from the ridge to
reach the junction where Mishap's mom would pick us up, and save
five miles of tiring up and down terrain. Even without the
accident, I'd need this accommodation!

On Geneva Peak, looking back north through our country
of the morning.

We wandered for steep miles to the point where the "red line"
trail from the valley rejoined the ridge. Already, we could see
the crazed line made by the divide... Jogging merrily left and
right across our horizon, we'd add at least two more giant curves
to the spectacle of it before the end of the day. I alternated
between feeling generally okay and being a little scared about
the new discomfort in my ribs as the day wore on. Once I lay down
and stretched, hearing an ominous "pop" in my sternum, then
feeling greater discomfort on standing up again.

Oh jeesh.

That was really irritating. I already had all this pain
in my left shoulder/arm...now the bruised ribs...along with
the sense of being tired. I pretty much decided to separate
from the group because I felt like I was falling apart
trying to keep up with them. I blamed myself for the fall,
because I was just pushing too hard.

On the positive side, by traveling south, we were meeting many
people we knew on the CDT. Mishap met someone she'd been looking
for based on obscure summit registers since the San Juans! Pretty
cool...We also met Gargoyle here, it was the last time
I'd see him.

I was happy to finally descend to the valley by a steep trail down
the Middle Fork Swan River, and
then a long walk through forest to again reach the CDT. Mishap's
mom was there, and we all walked to the truck along with Blue the
dog.

I was so tired and sore, I lay in my room, though Mishap brought
me a beer and a burger (thanks!). Over the next days, they did
more slack packing and I retreated to an Airbnb for three days of
rest.

Nice comment from old friend Theron in this section:

# June 23-25, Days 64-66

*Much copied from the [blog entry](https://getting-lost-on-the-cdt.blogspot.com/2022/06/taking-break.html) here.*

I visited REI, mostly took it easy, smoked a cigar along
the river in Frisco, cooked dinner at the AirBNB and
chatted with another guest.

Fellow lodging guest Roger. We had good conversations about life,
and he gave me a ride to Swan Creek.

It's easy to take your health for granted...I do this a lot. But
when you lose that "easy feeling" that grants enthusiasm for big
hills, things look very different. I didn't overthink it
though...I just tried to enjoy myself and rest a lot.

As it turned out, three days of rest wouldn't be enough, and this
was a hard thing to bear...

# June 26, Day 67

{% image /cmaimages/2022/stage15.jpg %}
20.9 miles, 2330 feet elevation gain.

{% image /cmaimages/2022/day67.jpg %}
Hike from Swan Creek to Copper Mountain, driven off
the crest by rain and fresh snow.

Roger gave me a ride back to the trail in the morning, which was
so helpful. I started walking where Mishap's mom had picked us up
a few days before. I just walked the road to highway 9 between
Frisco and Breckenridge, saving 10 miles of effort. Then I got on
the red line trail to complete the section to Copper Mountain.
I'd climbed up to a gorgeous plateau with an impressive view of a
high ridge I'd need to cross over, when storm clouds appeared.
Soon it was raining, with thunder sounding over the ridge. I
found a low route that touched Frisco, then followed a valley
trail to Copper Mountain. Despite heavy rain, I enjoyed the walk
down to Frisco on good trail along a rushing stream, with happy
hikers and bikers coming up the opposite way.

Uh oh, storm coming in.

Drat...it is the low country for me.

Rainbow Lake at a break in the storm above Frisco.

I reached town in an absolute downpour, happy for my umbrella,
but my feet were squelched. I drank a hot coffee, rented a room
for the night, then walked six miles to Copper Mountain, taking a
shuttle back to town in the evening. I'd connected all my
"footprints" now, I just needed to get up to i70 and the Gray's
Peak trailhead to finally escape the "Frisco Basin" where I was
beginning to feel a little trapped.

On the shuttle, I did meet Master Chef and her husband Fuego, the
[inimitable Czech couple who are so much fun to see](https://instagram.com/czechthemountains?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). We all went
to dinner with Info, who I'd last seen in Lake City, and a fine
fellow whose trail name I forgot (for the second time, I think!
He and I met on the trail once in the Northern San Juans).

The rather boring bike trail between Frisco and
Copper Mountain.

My room in Frisco...first signs of Giardia here!

Walk back to Copper Mountain

Only a short day today...turned around, sadly.

In Herman Gulch, looking to the high country.

In the morning, I paid 60 bucks for a ride to the Gray's peak
exit on i70. I walked back west asking the highest for three
miles or so, then finally crossed to the north side of this
important roadway. I was escaping the vortex!

Not.

As I climbed up Herman Gulch, I had serious stomach problems.
This lead to delays and even, nightmarishly, a soiled garment. I
felt really crappy...tired... Couldn't eat anything. And
breathing was becoming uncomfortable. The night before, I'd
noticed how painful it was to turn over in bed, and these chest
pains were getting worse.

I started to mentally calculate easier ways to get over Berthold
Pass that might save a couple thousand feet of climbing. I was in
poor shape. After a while, even reaching the town of Winter Park
in a dignified way started to seem impossible.

Paralyzed by my thoughts and discomfort, I found a flat spot and
resolved to camp early and see if tomorrow brought better news.
Feeling good to have simply made a decision, I was driven back
into consternation when I just tried to lie down to test how
level my sleeping spot was.

My sad attempted camp, where it hurt too much to lay down.

The pain of lowering myself to the ground... And getting up
again, was so miserable...I asked myself what the hell I was
doing here. Bruised ribs, sore muscles, a sick gut... Something
had to change.

With some disgust, I packed up my things and marched back down
the valley into the trees. Failure.

You never want to look it in the face. Or let it into your mind.
I had a hundred recriminations for myself at earlier points...
Warnings unheeded, blithely ignored. The sick gut was fully my
fault. In prior days in high mountains, I didn't always treat the
water. I had to own that one. Muttering and unhappy, I slowly
descended.

I did run into Apples and her husband Man Hands. Wow...I last saw
them in the Cebola Wilderness north of Pie Town, New Mexico. She
had cheerful words of encouragement, but I didn't believe them. I
was really thinking my trip is probably over.

Near the car, I met Anna and Matthew, two skinny students and
keen hikers from the Denver area. I asked for a ride that
direction, and they were happy to take me to Idaho Springs, so
long as I promised to tell them everything I could about hiking
the CDT. This cheered me up a good bit, taking me away from
thoughts of failure. Matthew and Anna, thank y'all so much for
your help and interest!

Thank you two for the ride to Idaho Springs!

I spent a night in Idaho Springs, calling my nephew Stephen in
Denver. We hatched a plan to meet up there for lunch the next
day. And so, I was going down to the flatlands, but with a more
than faint hope of returning within a week.
