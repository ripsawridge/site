## About me
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/portrait2.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This site is primarily devoted to my longtime hobby of alpine climbing.
I learned to climb in Washington State, and moved to Munich in 2006 to explore the Alps.  I enjoy the mountain activities so much that Iâ€™ve obsessively recorded them since the very first climb in 1997.
