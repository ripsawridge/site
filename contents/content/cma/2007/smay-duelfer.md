### Fleischbank, Duelfer Route</a>
_May, 2007_

Daniel and I tried the Fleischbank Ostwand, but had two problems. After the
grade III traverse into the face (snowy, loose, wet), we had a nice grade V
pitch, then a daunting move to start the next pitch which we had to aid. (I
think a hold fell off). Daniel started worrying about the rest of the route and
felt a little sick. He went up for the next pitch, but some crack climbing
moves proved too hard. He came down and I went up. I was at the belay of the
6th pitch, where the first VI- traverse crux begins. Daniel came up a bit, but
was feeling mentally done-in by this climb, so I lowered him to the previous
belay and we prepared to leave. That was one problem, but the second problem
may have shut me down too. There was a waterfall running down the face to my
left. I _think_, but I'm not sure, that it may have run across the grade VI
traverse too. If so, the amount of water would have made it impossible.

So I rappelled, then we did a long double-rope rappel, then reclimbed back
across the entry ramp. We hiked along a protected path to a hut on the south
side of the range for a drink, then went home.

We still got some good pictures:

Daniel Arndt has led an intimidating traverse deep into the East Face for our
attempt at the Hans Dülfer Route. May, 2007.

Our attempt on the Hans Dülfer route on the East Face of Fleischbank didn't
work out, but we still had some nice pitches on a nice day. Now to get down...

And this after the snow had mostly melted! In May 2007, there was a winter-like
period in the mountains with lots of fresh snow. We wished we had something
other than tennis shoes!
