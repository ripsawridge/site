The boys and I stayed in the Westfalenhaus Saturday night and climbed
the Schöntalspitze Sunday. On the way down, we followed a trail to Praxmar
for a while, as it snaked around the east side of the peak at about
2600 meters elevation. We left the trail at some beautiful little
ponds above the Schöntalbach and descended the moraine that is
such a prominent feature of this valley.

I realized that this is the ski tour way up the Schöntalspitze in the
winter, ha!

Things got messy near the little pump station at 1800 meters...we
were fighting brush in a direct descent of the creek. But soon we
were back at the car and the kids were eager to go get a Coke
at the gas station!
