A morning hike in foggy weather with Brecht, who I just met. He studies
Ornithology (birds, to the layman) and had some neat stories. He got some
good pictures too.

It was a big hike, going up from the valley station of the Alpspitze lift
to the summit with just a brief detour for struedel at the mountain station.
I foolishly wore big honking mountain boots, but I guess that is good training
too. We decided to be nice to our knees and take the lift down.
