I was finally going to the Bugaboos! Since I started alpine climbing it seemed 
like the  coolest place on the planet. I'd been scared away for a long time 
due to insufficient  abilities and fear of bad weather. But it was time to
 confront that fear, and go anyway. A  plan to stay in the hut at least made 
 sure we would be dry and toasty if it did rain for a  week!


I had two amazing partners for the trip: Robert Meshew and his longtime 
climbing companion  Mark Pratt. Before I knew it, we were loading up 
Mark's Subaru with all our gear and saying  goodbye. It was Friday evening 
in Issaquah, and Kris dropped me off in our brand new car  (purchased that 
very day...I had to live without it!).


The drive to the Bugs was really easy. We chattered away for hours, going 
through Spokane  and then the town where Robert grew up. He explained that 
everyone in the town, including  him and his parents believed that a 
Volkswagen Bus was the greatest vehicle in the world.  Entire neighborhoods 
collected and customized hundreds of these after school and work. I  learned 
many details about them, but what I especially liked were the two flat pane 
windows  some models had on the front. 


We fell asleep on a patch of dirt near the Canadian border. A huge rainstorm 
occurred in the  night, and I tried to keep my jeans stuffed under my bivy 
sack. End of Day One.


<a name=Saturday></a>
<h3>Saturday  <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


Day Two began with some breakfast in a Canadian town, then a cheerful extra 
hour of driving  past our turn off for the Bugaboos. We stocked up at a 
supermarket. Robert and I were trying  to keep the weight down by bringing 
dehydrated food and various chemical bars. Mark was  intent on bringing 
only the freshest melons and cuts of beef. As his kart piled high with  
flour, dough, rice and other staples I realized it was going to be a tough 
hike up to the  hut.

Anyway, so with a car full of food and gear we missed our turn, then came 
back. The long  dirt road wasn't too bad. We read aloud from "Breakfast 
of Champions," a pretty funny book  that Mark had read before. (Josh 
recommended it to me for the trip).


We parked at the very hot trailhead, and spent the next hour or two 
sorting gear, wrapping  the car with chicken wire, talking to people 
about the weather. Finally we were underway.


At least Mark and Robert were. With a sinking feeling, I realized I'd be 
trailing behind  them on the entire trip! Of course, my pack was filled 
with all kinds of fresh foods. I  frantically tried to lighten my load, 
tossing aside a gallon of milk and 24-pack of  fruit-roll-ups. "Why don't 
I take some of your stuff, I'm feeling great" chirped Mark. The  next 2.5 
hours were an exercise in pain management as I tried to keep up, grinning 
insanely  while my knee caps were being compressed under the weight. That 
which doesn't kill us...


Almost immediately, we had great views of the Bugaboo Glacier and Marmolada 
Spire. Wow! It  really looked like the cover of a fantasy novel set in a 
land called "Beringia" or something  else -gia. As we climbed a ladder 
into a scenic basin I could see that the hut was pretty  close. We rested 
at a bridge across a raging river. Robert and Mark cavorted while I wiped  
off the bone powder from the skin near joints.

We went into the hut, amazed by the accommodations. We got some window 
bunks with a great  glacier view. We filled our cupboards and had our first 
of many sips of Tequila blanco. What  a great comfort to provide warmth 
and sleepiness!


<a name=Sunday></a>
<h3>Sunday  <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


In the morning we were raring to climb. We got up at 3 am and shared the 
kitchen with one  other stumbling party. They wanted to climb the same 
thing! It was the Snowpatch Route on  Snowpatch Spire. 15 pitches, mostly 
5.6 and easier. We hurried out the door after some  coffee and pasties.


<br><br><center>
<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/snowpatch.jpg"><br>
<i>Snowpatch Spire, our route on the left skyline.</i><br></center>



We had a vague idea of the way, following a rocky slope up on the left 
side of the mountain,  then wandering onto increasingly loose terrain to 
circle back and up to the ridge on the  opposite side. We started climbing 
parallel to each other (but Mark far in front, always in  front) up the 
sandy scree slopes. Eventually things levelled out.


Mark got the nickname "Silent Sentinel" for his habit of getting so far 
ahead, then just  when you think "where the hell is he?" you see him 
staring at you expressionlessly from a  nearby perch. Before you can catch 
your breath - he is gone again!


With a dim glow in the sky, we climbed a 4th class gully for a few hundred 
feet to the base  of the route. We were at a notch in the ridge, with a great 
view of the hut below. Warm  yellow light spilled into a cold blue 
vastness. We roped up.


We had 2 8.5 mm 50 meter ropes. Some people would give us grief for 
climbing on such 
short ropes, but 50 meters ought to be enough for mountain rock climbs. 
We didn't buy the  argument that you would naturally go to 60 meters for 
all applications because of the weight  savings given by a thinner rope. 
During the trip some rappel routes were being established,  and there was 
always confusion over what you might need ("30 meter raps? 50 meter raps? 
60  meter raps?"), with a contingent of folks saying 50 meter raps are 
outdated. In our  experience, it seemed like stations had either A) 30 
meter raps, intended to get you down  with a single rope. Of course you 
need a 60 meter rope for that. 


Or B) 50 meter raps, in which case you need double 50s or 60s to get down. 
Technocratia  aside, these rap stations we used were brand new and really 
good. I appreciated them, and  according to the hut warden (who assists 
in rescues), they are already obviating the need  for rescue, as a party 
can zip down even in darkness pretty quickly. Before, people were  
leaving slings and gear all over the peaks in harrowing, unique descents.


But I digress. We roped up on a 25 meter doubled rope; Mark, me then 
Robert. Mark led us up  easy terrain in the dawn. Then Robert took 
over at a nice looking 5.8 hand and finger crack  that we knew was 
"off route," but just too fun to pass up. Robert started up it because 
he  was afraid Mark and I would jeer at him if he didn't chose the 
"obvious line." 


No such luck! Mark made bitter comments about losing the flow because 
of such a technical  pitch. "Yeah!" I said, with emphasis. Presumably 
rolling his eyes, Robert continued on a  fine lead. Soon we reached 
"the Wiessner Overhang," which is avoided on the right. Mark  looked 
wistfully at the overhang, obviously wanting to climb it. I was in the 
middle again,  and got some good pictures of Robert in the sunrise.

<br><br><center>
<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/spsrobert1.jpg"><br>
<i>An exciting traverse.</i><br></center>



Long, relatively low angle slabs took us past the famous Snowpatch on 
the left. Another  party passed us, roped but never placing pro. Mark 
was leading us on 5.10 variations which I  had to follow to retrieve 
the pro, while Robert walked serenely to the left. I pictured an  amused 
smile on the Sentinel's face.


I led us off the slabs and onto a ramp going up and right on a large 
broken face. 
Climbing into some chimneys, I managed to wedge my foot so well in a 
crack that it took me  over a minute to extract it! I climbed a bit higher 
and set a belay. Mark took off, then  Robert. I had dropped my headlamp, 
but it stopped on the edge of the cliff. When my turn  came, I tried to 
grab it, but it suddenly flew off the edge! I'd been betrayed by a clumsy,  
shuffling foot. Okay, adventure increased! No more headlamp for at least 
a week!


This was a great pitch, featuring some off-balance moves with great exposure. 
Next, an  awkward finger traverse led to easier ground. I made the 
mistake of avoiding the finger  traverse via an equally awkward lieback 
and mantle. I'll never live it down. "But you  yourself admitted you avoided 
the crux move. You did a variation, not the Snowpatch Route.  When are you 
going back to do the Snowpatch Route? It's a great route, you really owe 
it to  yourself."


So for the rest of the trip, we chided each other with this kind of talk 
in a special voice  that provoked much hilarity.


<br><br><center>
<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/goodtimes.jpg"><br>
<i>Pleased to be here and climbing!</i><br></center>



On the summit, we had the views we'd dreamed of. We were surrounded by 
Eastpost, Bugaboo,  Howser and Pigeon spires. There were enticing glimpses 
of mountains further away. We took  pictures and ate, lazily watching a 
party come up our rappel route. Their leader reached the  summit - they 
were the party that passed us earlier! "Goin' for two more climbs too!"  
he  said. Now we felt embarrassed for lazing about, and got to work rappelling.


Now, here, Robert and Mark introduced me to something they do all the time, 
but I'd never  done - simul-rapping. With Mark on one strand, and me on 
the other, we zipped down together.  You have to understand that if Mark 
unweights his rope, I'll plummet downward and lift him  up. Vice-versa 
too. I was a little nervous, plus, rapping on a single 8.5 mm rope is 
scary  anyway. By the time I reached the bottom, I'd wrapped it around 
my waist twice for more  friction. Boy, don't know when I'll get used to 
that, I thought. And I never did, but we  kept doing it. Finally, late in 
the trip I said "can we take a break from simul-rapping?"  because it 
mentally cooked me just a little too long! 


You know, I'm a fast rappeller, a really fast rappeller actually. So it's 
hard for me to buy  into simul-rapping because I know we are going slower 
than I normally go by myself. But I  have friends who are really slow 
rappellers. Now they should simul-rap. 


<br><br><center>

<i>Rappelling from Snowpatch Spire</i><br></center>



Okay back to the story. So we make 5-6 rappels, I forgot exactly how many. 
Then we scramble  down and make our way to the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col over 
rock and glacial snow. On a nice  flat stretch of ice I perform a comical 
pratfall, BAM! Increasing the hilarity is the blood  coming from my palm. 
You see, I borrowed Josh's lightweight ice axe for the trip, and failed  
to notice that he'd FILED THE ADZE LIKE A MEAT CLEAVER! We were all 
concerned - how can you  climb with a slashed hand? I applied some climbing 
tape to the wounds and dogmatically put  on my crampons. I hate flat ice 
rink style ice - I'm short of the natural balance required  to walk on it.


We started down the infamous Col on loose rocks, but soon had to transition 
to a steep snow  field. After some crampon adjustments, I followed Robert 
and Mark. Happily, I put on my wool  gloves, so the hand that touched the 
snow could be warm for the long facing in downclimb. We  went down and 
diagonally across, making for a snow bridge across the gaping bergschrund 
(that  should be one word: gapingbergschrund, because they are so often 
together). I'd gotten ahead  of Robert by glove power, but then fell 
behind on the snow bridge crossing. Kind of scary,  glad to have it down 
with. Whew.


A long walk on snow led to a boulderfield where we could hang out looking 
up at Bugaboo  Spire. It was still early - only 1 pm or so? I forgot. We 
were thinking of climbing another  route, but then it started to rain. We 
took shelter under a large rock. After an hour, it  seemed like we should 
go back to the hut.


We did this, eventually finding a good trail down moraines to the hut. 
We saw the turn-off  for Appleby Kampground, and started to feel like we 
knew our way around these parts. By the  time we reached the hut, the sun 
was back out. Oh well, we could read and rest for the next  day.


I went upstairs and read Shadowland, by Peter Straub. It's a pretty good 
book about a  powerful and corrupting magician and his young students who 
he intends to crush. Very  "shadowy." Later we had a great meal. Maybe 
pasta with a side of soup and dehydrated meal?  Somebody gave us some rice. 
We had a huge stockpile of food!


It was either today or the day before that we met Alpine Dave and 
Emily in the  hut! What a cool chance meeting. He gave us some beta about 
stuff, and we talked about  climbs. Emily was interested in the trip Kris 
took to the Galapagos Islands in May. Nice to  run into good folk from 
back home. 


I managed to buy a new headlamp from two Canadian guys who were going down. 
I gave them a  lot of money. Mark was like "you got screwed, man." But I 
felt I got a square deal, didn't  have to bargain, and they get some profit 
for making a trip to the store to buy a new one. 


<a name=Monday></a>
<h3>Monday  <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


The next day we got up early again and hiked up to the base of Bugaboo Spire 
to climb the NE  Arete. On an icy snow field we stopped to put on crampons. 
The moon rose between Snowpatch  and Bugaboo spires; the light was beautiful. 
We wandered around trying to choose the right  place to go up. After 
finding it, we awkwardly removed crampons where the snow met the rock  
and started up. Sandy, steep, uncertain terrain in the dark can be scary. 
Rob led the way,  always searching out the cleanest rock.


We reached a steep ledge about 150 feet up, with 5th class climbing above. 
I asked to rope  up, as we were uncertain of the rest of the way, but 
feeling committed to the steep line  above, and we had a good belay 
ledge here. I also wanted to change into rock shoes as it  might get a 
lot harder. In the dark I imagine all kinds of scenarios, and want to 
begin  moving securely.


We did this, and simulclimbed past a fixed cam for 150 feet to the ridge 
crest. There was  one really difficult move I was really happy to have a 
rope for! Mark found an easier way to  make the move but still...


On the crest we happily drank and ate, getting ready to climb. We were so 
ahead of schedule,  that it was still pitch black except for the 
beautiful moon! But as we stood there, and the  dawn slowly came,
 all was not well. Heavy clouds came in on either side of the mountain. 
 It  stayed mostly clear above Bugaboo, but eventually we could tell it 
 was raining in the clouds  on either side, a few miles away. We hemmed and
  hawed for well over an hour, really torn  about what to do, proposing 
  all kinds of theories. Another party came up, and two of the  four 
  decided to turn back, and the other two soloed up the route.

<i>A brooding sunrise on Snowpatch Spire.</i><br></center>




Deciding not to risk it, we made a few rappels and downclimbed back to 
the small glacier at the base. I had a hard time getting down the steep 
hard snow, and finally put on crampons for the final steps. Robert 
lobbied to scramble up Eastpost Spire, so we hiked over there for 
that. It was a great idea, as the views were great, and it provided 
an interesting view of the rest of the range. Folks milled around their
tents at Appleby Kampground.


On the way down, a fellow told us that the hut may be evacuated due to a
fire in the valley. By the time we arrived, the danger had apparently
passed, but the smell of burning was in the air. Later, as you may know,
much of the wild areas of B.C. were closed to travel, with stiff fines
and jail time for anyone trying to sneak around. It really was the summer
of fire this year. I mean, a fire on Johannesburg Mountain, that tower of
ice? Jeez...

Meal times were great. We'd have some soup, a bit of whiskey. A freeze-dried
meal to round things out, and maybe some bread and Nutella. At some point, we
broke into the pancake mix, opening up a real slice of heaven. Butter AND
Nutella AND syrup! A real caloric boost! We all compulsively read the
new guidebook, and talked with our fellow hut-mates about conditions.


<a name=Tuesday></a>
<h3>Tuesday  <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


Again, the 3 am alarm. The morning coffee, and the walk up to Bugaboo Spire.
This time we scrambled easily, knowing the way well even in the dark. We waited
a few minutes for light, and didn't care much about the clouds. Mark took off
ahead, planning to solo the route and wait for us on the summit. I led the
first technical pitch, rated 5.7 or 5.8, depending on the guidebook. There were
really nice flakes - it reminded me of Bear Creek Spire's first pitch from
earlier in the summer. Some final lieback moves brought me to a leftward
traverse with a fixed rope. After some exciting moves, I reached a good
alcove with a stance, and belayed Robert up. He continued up big flakes to
the left, and soon called for me to continue. He suggested I stop on a ledge
below him, and he'd continue on the next pitch to the ridge crest. I may have
handed some gear up to him. This pitch was exciting, as it traverses up and
right on a feature visible from far below. A few tricky moves took Robert to
a nice ledge. The sun was pleasant as I pinched flakes and stemmed my way
up a short dihedral.

<i>High on the ridgecrest.</i><br></center>



From the ledge, I led up a spectacular easy crack with great views all around.
I called for Robert to simul-climb, and eventually reached a ledge to serve
as a belay. Robert took off for a very long simul-climbing pitch (3 regular
pitches in length). It was a long chimney, well protected by chockstones
that allowed him to use slings and conserve the rest of the gear. After what
seemed like a really long time of climbing, I reached him and traded gear.
Continuing easily, I reached the ridge crest and was faced with a really
tough looking downclimb, now on the long up-and-down portion of the climb
before the true summit. I went around another way, and set a belay in
a notch. Robert took us from there to just below the summit, mostly 
downclimbing and working around towers. We could see Mark sitting on the 
summit. We could also see clouds in the sky building!


At the summit, Mark tossed down a top-rope, and that gave us the chance to
climb a 5.10+ variation finish that required us to make a committing (it
would be committing if it weren't for the top rope!) leap and scrabble
our feet for purchase. Eventually, reaching good hand jams allowed us to
each gain the summit. Yes! On top of Bugaboo Spire!


We gazed around happily, then as it started to snow, turned towards the
descent. Pretty soon we reached a rappel station, and started down.
The 2nd rappel took us down the Great Gendarme, a really dramatic feature.
Robert had a scare when an insignificant piece of his harness ripped, somehow
caught in something else. Between that and the snow, our casual summertime
attitude was harder to maintain! But we finished with the rappels, and began
scrambling down easy rock. We ran into many parties coming up the Kain Route.
Also, the weather improved, and we could remove gloves and warm sweaters.
We were down on the glacier by noon, or was it 2? I forgot, it was early though.

<i>Another view of Bugaboo Spire, our route on the right skyline.</i><br></center>



So we decided to hike over to Pigeon Spire, and solo the regular route.
It's a "must do", and the time we had there confirms that! I stumbled along
on the glacier somewhere behind Mark and Robert as usual. There were a few
crevasses to step over, but it just barely resembled a real "glacier." 
Some parties with ropes expressed dismay at our casual attitude.


After a final icy slope, we prepared for the rock climb. There were a few other
parties, all friendly folk. I wore rock shoes, and maybe Robert did. Amazingly
solid rock was a joy to climb - very grippy, cream-colored, and festooned
with features like knobs and cracks. At a false summit, we walked down a
steep slab, then continued up the other side. An optical illusion made it look
like we were walking on 5.8-5.9 terrain! Near the summit, the terrain was
kind of confusing. Robert and I followed our noses, getting to the recognizable
"5.4" move on the climb. I thought it was a little awkward, especially with 
800 feet of air below me! After this, slab walking reached the summit, which
we enjoyed with a few other parties. It's impossible not to look at the
Howser Spires, so evil yet beautiful! A nice fellow from N.Y.C. told us about
his summit ritual which involved a camera, a bowel movement, and an
illegal substance. This depressed me a little bit. Robert and I simul-rappelled
on a long double-rope rappel with another party, while Mark downclimbed.
We scrambled down the rest of the way, really satisfied with this amazing 
"must do" climb.

Now, how to get back to the hut. We were curious about an alternate descent
down the Snowpatch-Pigeon Col. It makes rappels down steep rock next to an
icefall, then continues naturally back to the hut, essentially reversing
the approach to the "Snowpatch Route." We crossed the glacier, then found the
rappel anchors. This seemed like a good alternative, because it avoided crowds,
rockfall, and various potential epics on the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col. We didn't
find it difficult on Sunday, but had since heard several chilling tales
of near-disaster from the area. I believe we started making single-rope rappels,
and the terrain was very steep. It was a little bit stressful for some
reason, possibly the big exposure below (a mess of icefalls and smooth granite
walls - looked like aid climbing territory), and wondering where the next
anchor was. I "led" one of the stranger rappels, Mark and Robert seemed to
appreciate it. That made me feel good, so I took the next one too, then
Robert did the final rappel into a large moat, then easily climbed snow
out the opposite side.


<br><br><center>
<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/alternate.jpg"><br>
<i>Alternate route back to the hut.</i><br></center>



Easy travel led us around a corner alternately on a glacier or on loose
moraine to the left. We split up here, Mark and Robert moving on ahead.
I wouldn't see them again for a while, as I didn't like either route,
so tried to make a new one. I gave up on that (think slabs covered with
ball-bearings, oh, and ice patches). I followed Robert's way, but couldn't
duplicate his amazing abilities crampon-less on steep icy ground. So
I put on crampons, and continued down on glacier, hopping over muddy
crevasses. Finally I got near my companions and they took off again.
I think they had to wait once more when another steep slab took me
a few extra minutes.  I was continually torn between trying to keep up,
and trying to achieve a reasonable level of security - I guess I need a
lot of security on 3rd-4th class crappy terrain!


The terrain became familiar, and soon we were looking down on the hut.
I stayed behind to savor the day, looking back at what we'd done.
The afternoon light was beautiful on all the peaks, and water from a
roaring stream tasted delicious! Back at the hut, another great dinner,
some reading and a good night's sleep followed.


 <a name=Wednesday></a>
<h3>Wednesday  <a href=#TOP>(To page top)</a></h3>


Today would be our last climbing day. That couldn't prevent us from sleeping
in and enjoying a late breakfast of pancakes. Finally we got motivated, and
made the now very familiar hike up to the glacier below Bugaboo Spire.
We took a full rack and double ropes, eager to climb McTech Arete, a great
5.10a multipitch climb on Crescent Spire. We were in luck - a party had just
finished the climb and was packing up to hike away. A previous try
at this justly popular climb had been thwarted by many and/or slow parties.


<br><br><center>
<img src="images/articles/trips/2003/topop1ma.jpg"><br>
<i>Looking down on pitch one.</i><br></center>



I got the first lead, climbing easy blocky ground to a hand crack in a
corner. It got really exciting when I reached a roof. I locked off and
placed some gear. No wait, there is a perfectly good cam already here!
I think I backed it up anyway, kind of suspicious of it. I launched over
the overhang, glad for my many climbing trips to Index over the summer.
I reached an uncomfortable hanging belay, and called for Mark and Robert
to follow. Especially on this climb, the "Petzl Reverso" was really nice
to have. I could belay both followers at once very easily. They enjoyed
the overhang, and solid hand jams.

Mark set off for the next pitch, the crux at 5.10a. It climbs an improbable
vertical thin crack for at least 50 feet, then goes out of sight at a
lower angle. Very dramatic! Robert and I climbed it together, me about 15 feet
above him, which allowed me to get a great pitch of him near the crux.
It was an amazing pitch! There are actually good stances to get in gear,
and the crack varies in size: sometimes fingerlocks, sometimes jams, and feet
usually have a ledge to stand on, which makes it a little easier than it looks.
The 5.10a move is identifiable, kind of an off-balance lieback move at a
bend in the crack. At the belay, we were really psyched about what a great
climb this was turning out to be!


Robert took us up blockier terrain for a pitch. It didn't have the stellar
jamming of other pitches, but he was in "I'll lead the loose, grungy stuff"
mode. A valuable guy to have along!


I set off on the next pitch which was probably my favorite pitch of the whole
trip. A long, sustained 5.8 hand crack, complete (repleat?) with two roofs!
Mark and Robert doled out advice as I reached the first roof. We only had 2
cams of the size for this, so I needed to conserve them. I placed a green
Metolius cam 10 feet below the first roof. "No no no!" they said. I ignored
them. "Poseurs..." I thought. But at the roof I had to agree with their
assessment: by losing that cam now I'd have a loong ways to go, and may
have no protection for the upper roof. So I protected at the roof and 
downclimbed to retrieve the cam. I hoped I wouldn't get too tired with
all this! The first roof required a short lieback move. 
At this moment Mark said in a strained voice: "DON'T LOSE IT!"
Well that scared me!
When queried later, he said I looked so cool as a cucumber, that he
didn't think that would break my stride. So watch out for him!
Anyway, due to a lack of
gear, I continued for a long ways above, feeling the maw of
empty space pulling at me. Hand, hand, foot, foot. I had to use the
crack for my feet the whole way, but it was pretty comfortable. I placed
a hex, then continued to the upper overhang and sunk the green Metolius cam.
It was passed on the right, a bit easier than it looked. From here, some
more enjoyable climbing led past short walls to a fantastic ledge spanning
the arete.

Robert and Mark appeared with gear, and Mark led us up a really enjoyable
5.7 - 5.8 hand crack with great exposure. Robert and I were grinning our
heads away - dang this climb is <i>amazing!</i> When I go back to
the Bugaboos, I will gladly do this route again (and again!).


Robert led the loose and grungy final pitch. It seemed kind of dangerous
for people far below, as it traversed a crumbly ledge. But we didn't knock
anything big off. Climbing the final loose (shifting?) blocks was pretty
exciting. Here we were exposed to the cold wind, I wished I had more than
a t-shirt! Robert hiked on to the summit of Crescent Spire, but Mark and
I were happy to wait out of the wind for him to return. He is a relentless
peak bagger! I would be too, but the sweet, sweet pitches below had 
mesmerized me, and all I could do was replay them in my head.


This dreamy attitude continued for the 6 rappels to the base. Still deeply
satisfied, I looked around at the peaks in evening light, knowing it would
be at least a year before seeing them again. We ate our final dinner
at the hut in mournful silence...


Not really! We were happy with our trip, maybe feeling a little smug.
The only disturbance was that a party had climbed the Beckey/Chouinard
route on S. Howser Tower. We had wanted to, but decided the weather and a
party of three made it too risky. But now, we had so quickly climbed
McTech Arete, that we felt guilty for not trying it! And this returning
party, visibly satisfied by the route (eww, I've got to cut this
"visibly satisfied" and "deeply satisfied" and "sweet, sweet" stuff out.
I'm sorry), reminded us of how little we'd done. We will certainly be
back to attempt that climb next year. I'm going to dream about it all winter...
so...swee-KNOCK IT OFF!

Another sunny day, and we were packing to go. It didn't take long to
reach the car, down in the boiling hot valley. We drove to a hot springs
for a shower (the lady let me in fer free!), and a slice of pizza.
We still had one more climb for our trip, and headed off into the sunset
for it. But that is another story...
