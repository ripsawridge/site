I wanted to show Barbara the long Isar run I did a week before. She was initially
sad, because she wanted to go to high mountains, but I thought there was too
much snow for the highest fun. I finally won her over though...running through
the woods up and down with Mara was beautiful. And the river was fantastic.
Another magical day with my girl, after a wonderful dinner and night.
I'm a happy man.
