<b>Hochblassen and Ochsenaelpelekopf</b>
<i>Feb. 2, 2014</i>
A great snowshoe hike today up Hochblassen, and then to the Ochsenaelpelekopf on the other side of the valley. I ate lunch by the Jaeger Huette, watching the snow come down pretty hard. It was a day of clouds and snow on and off. No views from either summit. Fun anyway. 1400 meters up/down from the Ammerwald Hotel.

<b>Friederspitze</b>
<i>January 18, 2014</i>
Snowshoe hike up Friderspitze. 1250 meters up/down.

<b>Forgot the name</b>
<i>January, 2014</i>
Ski up a peak in the Sellrain with Josef, unfortunately ran out of time (and shape!), so didn't make the summit. About 1000 meters up/down.
