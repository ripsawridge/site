I set out at 5:30 am from Redmond with a very light pack
and my ice ax, determined to do *something* interesting
around Sloan and 
Bedal Peaks.  Maybe I'd climb Bedal Peak.
Maybe I'd encircle one of them.  Who knew?  Not me!  But
the weather was good and the day ripe for the squeezing!



I finally decided to make for a pond in the saddle between
the peaks at 5330 feet.  The 
Washington Trails Association web site described two
ways to get there.  I picked the easier one, but it was
still rough.  1700 feet up through forest, brush and heather
that alternated between horrible and just about to become
horrible.

Actually it wasn't that bad.  Let's just say I aerated a lot
of musty forest soil with the ice ax!  I could usually
climb over a downed mammoth tree with a solid patch of soil
to sink the pick into.  I used the compass to travel north
and east, finally breaking out of the trees to beautiful
red heather with cliffs above.



I worked south under the cliffs until a lower angle opening
was found.  Ready for some rock climbing, I moved into
the cleft, ascending near a trickling stream.  Enjoyable
4th class rock.  Emerging onto heather above the cliff
band, I continued traversing south towards the saddle.
(*From here I took the "Bedal highway" picture*)



The sidehilling finally over, I hit the saddle about 100 feet
too high and moved down to the lake.  With no time to rest (it
was about 10:15, I started the hike at 7:15 at 2800') I
decided to head up to the Sloan Glacier.  My unspoken ambition
to climb the peak and get down by dark were finally banished
as I realized the scale of that undertaking!  The peak continually
receded behind intervening ridges, as the snow got thicker.



I traveled in an interesting mix of snow-covered heather and
ice-coated rock.  The ice always shattered when I used my
pick, so I'd go around an easier way, taking my time in
the empty park.  The land really felt empty and quiet.  That's
one of my favorite things: it's like being a kid locked in a
toy store at night...*all yours!*

Finally, I reached a large snowfield, crevassed at the bottom.
I hesitated, thinking this might be the glacier.  But I didn't really
believe that, and I started cautiously up.  Soon the snow became
very icy and I had to chop steps (no crampons).  I became pretty
nervous about the exposure and the snow conditions.  Suddenly, the
slope looked very steep.  Using my compass I checked the angle:
only 20 degrees.  Oh.



I overcame my fear, reaching thicker snow and the end of the
snowfield.  As it turns out, it really was an "icefield," as I
found out at the moat separating the ice from snow-covered rock.
I crossed and reached a plateau at 6660' with a good view of the glacier.
I'd had enough excitement, so this was my stopping point for the
day.  I was worried about descending the snow, so I didn't stay
long.



But I needn't have worried...I enjoyed a wonderful glissade, finding
better conditions to the left, and a good run-out into a bowl.
I worked my way down to the pond for a drink.  Then the heather
(I went under all cliffs this time), then the forest, then the
trail.  Reached the car at 3:30 and drove home.
