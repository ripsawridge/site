### Index Climbing, 10/02/04
Robert Meshew and I went for a quick morning climb. We warmed up on the finger
crack pitch of Aries, then I got scared trying to lead the chimney (which seemed
so easy last time!). Both of us backed off of that, so Robert led around a
different way, and I finished the climb with the cool undercling traverse
to the chain anchors. I eventually realized the mistake in the chimney: we needed
to place some gear high in the back, then come back down and start chimney-climbing
well out in the wide slot. It feels really insecure trying to begin climbing
it when you are lodged deep in the back. Oh well, next time! After this, Robert led
the first pitch of 
Princely Ambition, doing a great job on his first time.
I led pitch 2, dirty but still fun. Then Robert led 
Godzilla and I followed.
A great morning at Index!
